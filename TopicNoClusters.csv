As BCI is capable of detecting human intentions, it is a promising communication tool for paralyzed patients for communicating with external world. Many of the current BCI systems employ electroencephalogram (EEG) which is the most widely used noninvasive brain activity recording technique. EEG signal carries potential features to identify and decode human intentions and mental tasks. Recently, many researchers have started exploiting the possibilities of BCI in entertainment and cognitive skill enhancement. BCI-based games have been identified as a unique entertainment mechanism nowadays, â€œcontrolling a 2-D, 3-D or virtual computer game solely by playerâ€™s brain waves.â€ BCI games work based on a neurofeedback paradigmwhich allows an individual to self-regulate his brain signal in response to the real-time visual or auditory feedback of his brain waves/features. This neurofeedback in a gaming environment motivates and trains the players to control his brain features toward the desired stage (self-regulation). This chapter explores the state-of-the-art BCI technology in neurofeedback games, employing EEG signal. It also provides a survey of the existing EEG-based neurofeedback games and evaluates their success rates, challenging factors and influence on players. In neurofeedback games, a number of features extracted from EEG accompanied with sustained attention, selective attention, visuospatial attention, motor imagery, eye movements, etc. have been employed as distinct control signals.We will briefly review and compare various signal processing methodologies and machine-learning techniques employed in those studies to extract and decode the brain features. Besides the structure and algorithms used in neurofeedback games, the therapeutic effects of neurofeedback training and its capabilities for the enhancement of cognitive skills will also be briefly discussed in this chapter. Neurofeedback training helps to rewire brainâ€™s underlying neural circuits and to improve brain functions. Therefore, it is considered as an effective tool for boosting cognitive skills of both healthy and the disabled. Specifically, neurofeedback has been considered as an efficient treatment modality for individuals with attention-deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD). ADHD is characterized by three behavioral symptoms: inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. Along with the conventional intervention strategies such as medication, behavioral treatments, etc., neurofeedback in BCI games has also been emerging as a promising modality for treating the attention deficit. We will also discuss portable and economical EEG recording devices currently employed in BCI-based brain training modules/games. Finally, the chapter will be concluded with a brief overview of the neurofeedback developments in the context of BCI-based games until now, their potential impact on the healthy as well as on people with neurological disorders, challenges in transferring the successful protocols from laboratories into the market and hurdles in real-time BCI system design and development.

One empirical context demonstrating potential for closing this gap is embodied design, wherein students learn to enact new movement patterns that instantiate mathematical schemes. Changes in studentsâ€™ perceptuomotor behavior in such contexts have been described as bearing markers of systemic phase transitions, but no research to date has characterized these dynamics quantitatively. This study applied a nonlinear analysis method, continuous cross-Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA), to touchscreen data excerpts from 39 study participants working with the Mathematics Imagery Trainer on the Parallel Bars problem. We then conducted linear regression analysis of a panel of five RQA metrics on learning phase (Exploration, Discovery, and Fluency) to identify how nonlinear dynamics changed as fluency developed. Results showed an increase in determinism from the Exploration to the Discovery phase, and an increase in recurrence rate, trapping time, mean line length, and normalized entropy from Discovery to Fluency phases. To put these dynamics in context, we qualitatively contrasted the RQA metric trajectories of two case study participants who developed different degrees of fluency. Our results support the hypothesized existence of phase transitions in the humanâ€“technology dynamical system during a math learning task. More broadly, this study illustrates the purchase of nonlinear methods on multimodal mathematics learning data and reveals perceptuomotor learning dynamics informative for the design and use of embodied-interaction technologies.

These ecosystems extend across different layers including the organisational, sectoral, regional, national and international dimensions. The interconnectedness of these layers has not have received much attention in foresight literature and practise. However, both the development and diffusion of innovations are subject to framework conditions not only within, but also across, multiple layers of innovation ecosystems. The design and management of foresight exercises are thus liable to addressing and serving these different layers â€” especially when the goal is to improve the performance and impact of such â€œinterconnected and interdependent systemsâ€. This paper develops further the concept of â€˜multi-layered foresightâ€™ by addressing multiple layers of innovation ecosystems in foresight design and management. We explore the implications of applying this type of foresight on improving systemic understanding, enhancing stakeholder networking and developing innovation capacities across the layers of ecosystems. The theoretical underpinnings are tested through a case study of the â€˜Personal Health Systems (PHS) Foresightâ€™ project. This project explored international future developments in the health sector, which is characterised by multiple disciplines, communities of practise, technologies, and geographical contexts. In the case of PHS the emerging innovation ecosystems are often conditioned by fragmented development communities, major barriers to market development, and duplication of efforts. The project combined analytical, social networking, online envisioning and scenario building methods to address complexity and create impact in multiple layers. Possible futures for personal health systems were explored through intense dialogues with stakeholders and a desirable future state was sketched through the success scenario methodology. The implications and strategic issues for different groups of stakeholders were outlined, enabling these stakeholders to articulate their efforts as part of a broader agenda at the multiple layers of innovation ecosystems.

The current rapid development of cloud resource technology and the concept of ubiquitous learning, which is characterized by personalization anytime and anywhere, has challenged the absolute teaching function of teachers and the neat and uniform teaching methods of textbooks and classrooms. Ubiquitous learning is a historical return to human learning, and teachers need to transform their roles in this change, to improve their adaptability and to become the organic driving force to realize the contemporary information aggregation structure. Based on this understanding, this paper begins with an analysis of the intelligent form of current cloud resources and explores the conceptual understanding and transformation pathways of the ecological context of ubiquitous learning and the corresponding role of teachers. In this paper, we design a system consisting of a teacher, a student, and an administrator, which can publish English test papers, create and manage a personal library of test papers, monitor students' practice status, and review students' performance. Storage management can be automated and intelligent, and all storage resources are integrated together, and customers see a single storage space. It improves storage efficiency, solves the waste of storage space through virtualization technology, can automatically redistribute data, and improves the utilization of storage space, while having load balancing and fault redundancy functions. Cloud storage can achieve scale effect and elastic expansion, reduce operating costs, and avoid wasting resources.

The LHS uses routine data from service delivery and patient care to generate knowledge to continuously improve healthcare. The aim of this project was to explore key features of a successful and sustainable LHS to inform implementation in an Academic Health Science Centre context. Methods: We purposively identified and conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with leaders, experienced in supporting or developing data driven innovations in healthcare. A thematic analysis using NVivo was undertaken. Results: Analysis of 26 interviews revealed five themes thought to be integral in an effective, sustainable LHS: (1) Systematic approaches and iterative, continuous learning with implementation into healthcare contributing to new best-practice care; (2) Broad stakeholder, clinician and academic engagement, with collective vision, leadership, governance and a culture of trust, transparency and co-design; (3) Skilled workforce, capability and capacity building; (4) Resources with sustained investment over time and; (5) Data access, systems and processes being integral to a sustainable LHS. Conclusions: This qualitative study provides insights into the elements of a sustainable LHS across a range of leaders in data-driven healthcare improvement. Fundamentally, an LHS requires continuous learning with implementation of new evidence back into frontline care to improve outcomes. Structure, governance, trust, culture, vision and leadership were all seen as important along with a skilled workforce and sustained investment. Processes and systems to optimise access to quality data were also seen as vital in an effective, sustainable LHS. These findings will inform a co-designed framework for implementing a sustainable LHS within the Australian healthcare and Academic Health Science Centre context. It is anticipated that application of these findings will assist to embed and accelerate the use of routine health data to continuously generate new knowledge and ongoing improvement in healthcare delivery and health outcomes.

(2020),AMCP partnership forum: What's next for specialty medication benefit design and reimbursement,Journal of Managed Care and Specialty Pharmacy,,10.18553/jmcp.2020.20121,"Rising specialty drug costs present a challenge for patients and payers. High-cost products, such as gene therapies or immunotherapies, can significantly affect the budget of a payer that does not have the ability to spread risk across a large population. Stakeholders are considering new reimbursement and benefit designs for specialty medications to improve efficiencies and better manage costs. The potential effect of changes to specialty medication benefit designs and reimbursement systems on patient care, access to medications, and the overall health care system are important considerations when assessing the benefits and challenges associated with reform proposals. Options to better manage the affordability of specialty medications are needed to ensure that patients can continue to access medications, while allowing payers to remain good stewards of health care dollars and supporting marketplace competition and incentives to stimulate innovation. New benefit designs that address these needs, while also supporting marketplace competition and providing incentives that stimulate innovation, have been considered. To explore options, AMCP convened a multidisciplinary stakeholder forum on December 10-11, 2019, in Alexandria, VA. Health care leaders representing academia, health plans, integrated delivery systems, industry leaders, pharmaceutical manufacturers, pharmacy benefit managers, employers, federal government agencies, national health care provider organizations, and patient advocacy organizations participated in the forum. The forum was designed for stakeholders to discuss strategies for the following: (a) reduce costs for beneficiaries while maintaining or improving access to prescription drugs; (b) support marketplace competition and incentives for biopharmaceutical innovation; (c) minimize physicians' financial risk associated with managing drug inventories; (d) remove adverse reimbursement incentives for prescribing higher priced drugs; (e) consider the cost-effectiveness of treatments and services across the health care continuum; and (f) support quality measurement and program evaluation metrics. Recommendations emerging from the forum included creation of novel payment models for the most expensive therapies that allow for larger risk pools, while maintaining the sustainability of the reinsurance market remains. Simplification and standardization were cited as goals for system reform and technological innovations that allow health care providers to view cost-effectiveness information at the point of prescribing, combined with value-based contracting were also recommended. Finally, ensuring that plans remain patient-centric and are designed to address patient needs holistically was stressed as an important goal. Â© 2020, Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy.
