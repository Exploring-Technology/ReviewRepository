Design/methodology/approach A critical and thematic analysis conducted on 115 scientific papers reveals a noticeable growth in adopting digital technologies to leverage a CE system. Moreover, a conceptual framework is developed to show the interrelationship between different I4.0 technologies to foster the implantation of CE in the construction industry. Findings Most of the existing bodies of research provide conceptual solutions rather than developing workable applications and the future of smart cities. Moreover, the coalescence of different technologies is highly recommended to enable tracking of building assets' and components' (e.g. fixtures and fittings and structural components) performance, which enables users to optimize the salvage value of components reusing or recycling them just in time and extending assets' operating lifetime. Finally, circular supply chain management must be adopted for both new and existing buildings to realise the industry's CE ambitions. Hence, further applied research is required to foster CE adoption for existing cities and infrastructure that connects them.

Management scholars taking a paradoxical lens have predominantly focused on social paradoxes within the confines of the organization. Technological change has often been treated as an exogenous force bringing previously latent tensions to the fore. Such newly salient paradoxes are viewed as instigating managerial sensemaking and exploration of strategic responses that will re-establish equilibrium. Our investigation of how digital innovations disrupted London taxiwork and global music distribution shows something different. The paradoxical tensions raised by emerging digital technologies inevitably play out at industry and societal levels. Concomitant changes in boundaries, categories, and potentials for action that shape and channel ongoing industry transformation call for organizational responses and adaptation. Critically, such tensions must be interpreted within the context of industry arrangements absent a centrally controlling actor. Rather than episodes of exogenous change, the nature of the digital, along with interactions across multiple sources of agency, continually surface complex dynamic and systemic tensions within and across industries. Our findings highlight the importance of explicitly accounting for the inter-relatedness and mutual dependence of the social and technical elements of change. As digital innovation expands and starts to impact all aspects of human experience it is critical for management scholars to reflect how the paradoxical perspective can be expanded to better understand these contemporary large-scale changes.

This has been noted in some studies, in which researchers have made visible pedagogical models, teaching strategies and impacts of including social and solidarity economy contents and practices in undergraduate and graduate programs on the educational community, organizations and society. In accordance with the literature review, most studies have reported the perspective of professors or managers on educational experiences, but little is known about students' involvement in these processes. Consequently, it is appropriate to continue exploring the educational potential of this relationship as a contribution to the quality and relevance of higher education and, in turn, the development of social and solidarity economy as an alternative for social transformation. Objetives This article derives from an educational research process whose objective is to analyze the questions asked by university students about social and solidarity economy, giving an account of their educational interest and perspectives. Materials and Methods The study was conducted under educational research guidelines, the hermeneutic approach and descriptive-interpretative research guidance, assuming that student asks questions from their particular interest and prior knowledge. It involved 96 university students whose undergraduate curriculum includes social and solidarity economy education and who, at the time of the study, were enrolled in one of the specific courses on the subject. The technique employed to gather information was the focal group and the instrument used was a workshop called ""Question Tree"" that caused students to ask open questions on social solidarity economy. Questions were later categorized in a double-entry analysis matrix: dimensions of social and solidarity economy and types of questions according to the complexity level of the knowledge required by them. Results/Limitations/Implications Students' questions reflect their interests, expectations and cognitive processes; 170 questions were asked which, regarding the dimensions of solidarity economy, mostly reflect (49%) a pragmatic interest on the current reality of this socio-economic model, followed by an emerging category that questioned the educational strategy for the subject, especially in terms of didactics (22%). There was no particular interest in the theory. The types of questions are mainly those reflecting critical thinking and active citizenships to support social transformation (41%), followed by those looking into data (36%), which points out the need for supplementary strategies to even out basic knowledge of the topic. In some cases, there is certain skepticism about the reality and project of social and solidarity economy. Findings imply subsequent research to develop teaching strategies and the proposed topics, showing the potential of questions to trigger innovative educational processes centered on students' learning and experiences. Another alternative for future studies is to apply the same data collection instrument to a statistically representative sample of the studied population, which this qualitative research presents as a limitation to establish correlations by gender, age group, region of the country, and program. Conclusions/Originality The condensed results of the study indicate that, for university students, social and solidarity economy as a reality, theory and project becomes contents and practices that favor critical and systemic thinking, interdisciplinarity, analytical resolution of social problems, cooperative work, creativity, entrepreneurship and social innovation. Also, students demand significant learning and active participation in knowledge building based on experiences that are motivating and aimed at responding to challenges such as those posed by the problems of today's society. In this respect, the relationship between higher education and social and solidarity economy is an opportunity to introduce educational innovation that broadens students' skills to be active citizens, know about social and solidarity economy, and undertake solidarity enterprises and social innovation in the territory. In doing this and using technologies, they could join a global movement that is being consolidated by academic and union networks. This presents challenges to professors and the development of educational approaches that, based on interaction and the students' interests, knowledge and expectations, focus on learning and experience in personalized processes. Higher education in social and solidarity economy, with its potential to contribute to sustainable development, has not been sufficiently explored. While educational agendas and the social solidarity economy movement highlight the importance of young people and their role in the generational connection required to strengthen their organizations, little is known about their interests and expectations. The originality of this research then lies in the fact that it does not build on the questions asked to young students, which generally guide most studies, but on the voice of students who, with their questions and the method used, provide a baseline that can be replicated, compared with other realities, and supplemented as part of a teaching strategy applicable at different formal and non-formal educational levels that further solidarity education. Therefore, this study replicated in other higher education contexts may help to improve approaches, contents and methods to enable better coordination between education and a scenario of professional performance in the social and solidarity economy sector, taking the jobs it creates and, from entrepreneurship, establishing new organizations or providing new products and services to territories.

Design/methodology/approach: For the present study, an employee survey (online questionnaire) was used for data collection. The data were collected through an adopted questionnaire by using emails and messaging applications. Structural EquationÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â Modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze data collected from 245 respondents. Findings: The findings of this study delineate that entrepreneurial leadership positively and significantly influences employee innovative behavior. Moreover, the relationship between entrepreneurial leadership and employee innovative behavior was partially mediated by employee epistemic curiosity (EC) and creative process engagement (CPE). The sequential mediation by the employee epistemic curiosity and creative process engagement between the link of entrepreneurial leadership and employee innovative behavior was also confirmed. Practical implications: In innovation-intensive organizations like software development firms, entrepreneurial leadership style can foster employee innovative behavior that is critical for organizational innovation success. This study provides information to the strategic leaders on how leadership behaviors can drive employee innovative behavior, particularly in the context of software development companies. Originality/value: This study is an attempt to extend the scarce literature on the mechanisms through which leadership styles impact employee innovative behavior.

This paper aims to theorize and examine how central cognition elaboration cue and peripheral cognition elaboration cue impact usersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ continuance intention of mobile health applications in the context of the developing markets. Design/methodology/approach: Applying the elaboration likelihood model as the basic theoretical framework, this paper proposed the hypotheses and research model to explore the internal formation mechanism of usersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ continuance intention of mobile health applications. And the moderating effect of privacy concern was especially studied under the context of the developing market. The empirical investigation (N = 284) collects research data through questionnaire by selecting a certain mobile health application from Chinese markets. Findings: The results show that, both perceived usefulness and trust positively affect usersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ continuance intention. For central route, doctor's service quality and doctor's information quality positively influence perceived usefulness. For peripheral route, app's reputation and app's institution assurance significantly promote usersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ trust. What's more, for the moderating effect, privacy concern can enhance the impact of perceived usefulness on continuance intention and strengthen the effect of trust on continuance intention to a great extent. Originality/value: This paper is one of the first studies to focus on usersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ continuance intention of mobile health apps with the moderating effect of privacy concern in the developing markets. It is valuable to develop the study from the perspective of process-oriented to persuasion to explore usersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ behavioral intention.

The existing literature mainly considers strengthening adaptive capacity as a steady and linear process. This article explores possibilities to fast track positive adaptive capacity trajectories of small-scale farmers in the Northern Region of Ghana. Leverage points were identified by triangulating data from semi-structured interviews with farmers (n=72), key informant interviews (n=7) and focus group discussions (FG1 n=17; FG2 n=20). The results present two ways to approach adaptation planning: 1) using four generic leverage points (gender equality, social learning, information and knowledge, and access to finance) or 2) combining the adaptive capacity and leverage point frameworks, thereby creating 15 associations. The generic points provide a set of topics as a starting point for policy and intervention planning activities, while the 15 associations support the identification of place-specific leverage points. Four benefits of using leverage points for adaptive capacity in adaptation planning were identified: guidance on where to intervene in a system, ability to deal with complex systems, inclusion of both causal and teleological decision-making, and a possibility to target deep, transformative change.

Using property rights theory, the purpose of this paper is to hypothesize the contingent effect that these property rights changes have on the investment of individual human and financial capital toward entrepreneurship. In addition, this study also explores whether property rights changes have a differential effect on the two forms of entrepreneurship, namely, opportunity and necessity entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach This research uses logit regression analysis on a two-period model using the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) database to test these effects. Findings Contrary to existing evidence from western contexts, this study finds that property rights changes have a significant influence on the investment of both forms of capital toward necessity entrepreneurship in China. Research limitations/implications The use of a secondary database like GEM has certain limitations, such as the non-availability of data on a longitudinal basis, and the need to operationalize certain constructs like social and financial capital as non-continuous variables. Originality/value There has been limited research on the phenomena of necessity entrepreneurship in economies such as that of China.

The inclination to examination amongst Vietnamese people is believed to guarantee great opportunities; thus, it is not surprising to see that curriculums are saturated with tests such as short and long quizzes, periodical and summative tests. Unfortunately, test-oriented curriculums bring negative backwash towards teaching and learning, as well as affecting students' overall achievement. To address the issue on the negative backwash, laborious and ineffective error correction, and other emerging issues relevant to the traditional formative assessment in writing, collaborative e-portfolio project was initiated. It is aimed is to replace periodic tests and help reinforce formative assessment in an academic writing held in university in Hanoi, Vietnam. Data were collected from two experimental groups' reflective essays, an entry on their e-portfolios, which were analyzed through thematic analysis. Finally, after assessing the innovative practice through Kirkpatrick and Kirkpatrick (2006) four level of program evaluation, it was found that students have enjoyed the project, learned necessary skills for writing, improved attitude towards learning, and have achieved the course learning outcomes.

The hypotheses are empirically tested using a representative sample of 3676 small, medium and large firms from four South Asian countries and across all main sectors of economic activity. Given that we know little about the antecedents of the propensity to learn management practices in emerging markets, the study employs Bayesian Model Averaging approach to overcome the potential issue of model uncertainty. The results reveal that market competition, resource allocation towards internal and external R&D, good quality mobile network coverage and the use of external certified financial auditors have all positive and significant effects on the propensity to learn management practices. The results also suggest that private intellectual property rights protection in the context of inefficient legal systems can deter firms from learning, perhaps in fear of legal ramifications.

Emerging technologies have entered the gamut of resources which firms need to actively forecast and manage for competitive advantage. This study explored the idea of competitive advantage in the context of health insurance firms and how emerging technologies can augment existing capabilities towards this goal. The critical nature of health insurance as a social necessity and the application of emerging technologies in healthcare justified the need to theoretically establish what competencies were required for health insurance firms for technology driven competitive advantage. A qualitative method using modified Delphi technique in sequential combination to 43 in-depth expert interviews was used to explicate the factors. Data was analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative content and thematic intensity analysis. Organizational people orientation and service delivery capabilities emerged as foundations of a contemporary competitive advantage framework for health insurance firms supported by technical expertise, knowledge management practices and product innovation strategies. Results indicated that management of emerging technologies exerted a gravitational effect on firm competencies to create a contemporary competitive advantage framework.

Under this context, geographical sciences urgently needs to seek new paths through the deep integration of disciplines to better improve the knowledge system and contribute to the country and society development effectively. Based on the perspective of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), this paper firstly deeply analyzes the current status and problems of the integration and development of geographical sciences in China, and points out that it is not fully integrated with the frontier of international geographical sciences, and the global political, economic and cultural influence of geographical research in China needs to be strengthened; considers that the ability of Geographic Sciences integrating national major practical needs for theoretical and technological innovation should be improved; suggests that the internal discipline system of geographical sciences in China should be further optimized according to the needs of knowledge integration. Then, this paper proposes three paths for the integrated development of geographical sciences under the guidance of funding policies, that is, the interdisciplinary integration facing the frontiers of science and technology in the world, the multiple fields integration facing the major national development strategies, and inner-discipline integration facing the optimized application codes of NSFC. In future, based on maintaining the continuity and stability of the development of disciplines, the NSFC will encourage the integration of geographical sciences with other disciplines and fields through the improvement and innovation, so as to promote and build a healthier and more innovative system.

Drawing upon self-concordance theory, we argue that managers can augment employees' self-concordance-defined as the congruence of goals and actions with inner values and preferences-through transformational behavior and thereby contribute to innovation. However, transformational behavior is closely coupled to another form of influence, namely, process management, the attempt to directly manage innovation-related activities. This form of managerial influence reduces employees' self-concordance and thereby undermines innovation. We test our conceptual model in a sample of 188 innovation projects using a contextualized method that asked employees to assess their self-concordance and their managers' behavior during each project.

The complexity of CoPS makes them at a much higher risk of innovation failure as compared to ordinary products. Hence, it is of much practical significance to conduct study on the learning-from-failure mechanism. From the perspective of employees, it is difficult to learn from failure and failure makes them feel stressed both physically and mentally. Thus, it is imperative for organizations to support their employees in learning from failure. For this reason, there has now been plenty of attention brought to the concern about how to transform perceived organizational support into the practice of employees to learn from failures in the academic and practical circles. However, the existing study on the mechanism of transmission between the two remains in its infancy, let alone the in-depth exploration into this mechanism between different types of learning from failure in combination with their distinctive characteristics. In this paper, perceived organizational support theory and self-determination theory are integrated to construct an influencing mechanism model of perceived organizational support on the learning behavior of employees (double-loop learning and single-loop learning). Besides, a test is carried out on the mediating role of self-efficacy, affective commitment and the sense of obligation, based on which the significance of different mediating effects is compared. The data used in this study was collected from four high-tech enterprises with the experience of innovation failure in complex products and systems over the past two years. A total of 467 valid questionnaires were recovered by matching leaders with employees. Besides, SPSS21. 0 was applied for basic descriptive statistical analysis and Mplus7. 0 was adopted to construct structural equation model. The results of the empirical analysis conducted using 467 pieces of matched data are detailed as follows. Firstly, the perceived organizational support shows positive correlation with learning from failures for employees ( double-loop learning and single-loop learning). Secondly, self-efficacy and affective commitment exert a mediating effect between perceived organizational support and double-loop learning from failures, while the sense of obligation causes a mediating effect between perceived organizational support and single-loop learning from failures. Thirdly, the mediating effect produced by self-efficacy and affective commitment between perceived organizational support and double-loop learning from failures is more significant as compared to the sense of obligation, despite no significant difference observed in the mediating effects between self-efficacy and affective commitment. Lastly, when compared with self-efficacy and affective commitment, the sense of obligation exerts a more significant mediating effect between perceived organizational support and single-loop learning from failures. However, there is no significant difference found in the mediating effects between self-efficacy and affective commitment either. From the theoretical perspective, the perceived organizational support theory is first applied in this study to account for the impact of organizational support on different types of learning from failures for employees and the pathway to such impact. The analysis expands the scope of application for the perceived organizational support theory. In addition, it contributes to promoting the study on the effect and mechanism of organizational support in face of crisis. Secondly, the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œblack-boxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â mechanism between organizational support and different types of learning from failures is revealed in this study, thus improving the understanding as to the meaning, characteristics, influencing factors and formation mechanism of different types of learning from failures. Moreover, it advances the understanding as to the antecedents and formation mechanisms of different types of learning from failures. Thirdly, the context of innovation failure is integrated with self-determination theory in this study to demonstrate that self-determination theory provides a theoretical foundation for different types of learning from failures, which has made incremental contribution to the existing studies of self-determination theory and further expanded the scope of its application in the field of organizational behavior. From the practical perspective, the organization is supposed to build an internal multi-source support system to fully support the learning effort made by employees in the context of innovation failure. For enterprises, it is necessary to stimulate both the internal and external motivations of employees to engage with learning, and to adjust the intensity of both motivations in a timely manner, thus ensuring the overall optimal effect of learning from failures in practice Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2022,Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management.All Rights Reserved",2022,Article,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126998052&doi=10.13587%2fj.cnki.jieem.2022.02.005&partnerID=40&md5=0a4ea6dcebca9119129b904605dfedb0,C4,1,2017,Conference Paper,0.113327336,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.726975338,0.102035057,0.107279765,0,0.117689877,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.18274979,0.011767906,0,0,0,0.196574986,0.118066751,0,0,0,0,0.091881727,0,0,0,0,0.11429272,0,0.223182492,0,0,0,0.086980134,0,0,0.347511181,0,0.05604132,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.094211795,0.110571053,0.104144523,0.053430143,0,0,0,0,0.040079997,0.021900516,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.128107915,0,0.099133661,0,0,0.039616659,0,0,0.085346935,0,0,0.234181607,0,0,0,0,0.084659151,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,1,4

Today, with the rapid development of society, employment guidance is the primary task facing colleges and universities, and it is also the difficulty in the work of colleges and universities. The employment guidance of colleges and universities has also made new breakthroughs due to the rise of the Internet +. In the context of Internet +, the application of coaching technology in college career planning can help improve studentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ self-understanding, tap their potential, continuously enhance their ability to adapt to society, and promote the practical significance of higher quality employment. This paper takes the current situation of college studentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ career planning as the research background, and further explains the feasibility of coaching technology in college career planning education under the background of Internet + through the investigation of the current situation. The research results show that, compared with the traditional employment guidance courses, the Internet + supported coaching technology has the advantages of accurately positioning itself, developing career planning ideas, and improving the ability of target decomposition and execution. Therefore, as an emerging educational concept and technology, coaching technology in college employment guidance in the Internet + era enriches and develops the theories of employment planning education, which may completely change the existing employment guidance education mode and open up a new education mode.

However, it has recently been shown that declining levels of feedback seeking behavior may result in decreased psychological attachment over time. This study aims to explore whether individual adaptivity represents a mechanism through which feed-back seeking affects psychological attachment (i.e., well-being involvement and withdrawal). In addition, the interaction effect of organizational obstruction between individual adaptivity and psychological attachment was examined. Based on three-wave survey data obtained from 273 participants from French organizations, a moderated mediation model was tested using structural equation modeling. Results confirmed that adaptive performance mediated positively the relationship between feedback-seeking and well-being involvement and negatively with withdrawal. Moreover, perceived organizational obstruction moderated negatively the relationship between adaptive performance and withdrawal, and positively that with well-being. These results shed new light on the relationship between proactivity (i.e., feedback seeking behavior) and adaptive performance, but also on the positive short-term contribution of successful adaptation in a perceived obstructive organizational context. Theoretical contributions and practical implications for human resource management are discussed.

To explore the influence of innovation mechanism and process on the industrial innovation capability, a theory model is proposed, in which the innovation mechanism is divided into three parts consisting of forcing mechanism, management mechanism and learning mechanism, and the innovation process being divided into three phases including accumulation process, transformation process and diffusion process. The innovation capability is evaluated from input, output and collaboration side. Further, empirical tests are conducted to support the analytical model, adopting the method of questionnaire survey and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The findings show that the forcing mechanism plays the dominant role in stimulating innovation input, the management mechanism mainly supports the industry innovation for China's automotive industry, and the learning mechanism is a long-term process, which could promote innovation inputs fundamentally. Innovation process considered, the accumulating process contributes most to the effective organizing and collaborating of automotive industry, the transforming process is the core element of industry innovation, which is the necessary condition for high quality innovation input and output.

However, standards system of IoT is not yet mature, existing obvious overlapping and even conflicting standards, and enterprises lack mature technology standardization model, which severely restricts the structural upgrading and development of IoT. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: In this regard, this study combs the research context of the IoT, technology standardization and competition behavior, and analyze technology standardization models of IoT by combining theory with practice. Using game theory and profit function, this paper analyzes the selection mechanism of standardization model of IoT enterprises, and explores practical application of these models using competitive behavior theory. Findings: First, in the process of standardization, technology standardization model n enterprises is not single, nor is it immutable. Second, the trend of internationalization of technical standards is becoming more and more obvious. Third, if LoT enterprises want to achieve their own technology standardization, the corresponding competitive behavior is essential. Fourth, with the change of innovation capability and market forces, the competitive behavior of enterprises should be improved accordingly to better adapt to the changes of internal and external environment and ensure the realization of the standardization of enterprises. Fifth, if IoT attempts to achieve the same globalization as the internet, there must be a set of support systems. Originality/value: Finally, some suggestions are given for the future development in the field of IoT. This study will provide some theoretical support for promoting the development of standards and enhancing the competitiveness of IoT enterprises.

To this end, we explore the role of intellectual property rights (IPR) protection in the recent surge in the internationalisation of patents that originates from the newly emerging economies. The aim is to capture the outreach of the Northern intellectual property culture to the South and the South-North globalisation of the resulting intellectual property that emerges in the South. Global bilateral patent data are used to investigate the location specificity of IPR enforcement for the emergence of this phenomenon. We find that the harmonisation of IPR protection encourages foreign-patenting activities of Southern innovators. Our findings suggest that a global convergence of IPR protection can stimulate the production and the internationalisation of intellectual property in the South.

Space 4.0 ambitions are to place space at the heart of the successful evolution of Europe and the full implementation of the United Nations Agenda 2030 worldwide. The outcomes of the conference ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Space2030 and Space 4.0: synergies for capacity building in the XXI centuryÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â, recently co-organized by the European Space Policy Institute (ESPI) and the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA), with the support of the European Space Agency (ESA), point to the timeliness of a fresh look at the wider perspectives and strategies to be implemented in future space programmes. The paper summarizes these findings and recommendations involving stakeholders and representatives of civil society, mapping out available options and identifying the ideal conditions for their successful implementation. Innovative frameworks, partnerships and collaborations in this ecosystem are explored, posing special attention to improving the dialogue with civil society and other sectors, to make them aware of the potential of space, and to the creation of new mechanisms to identify, collect and process user needs, in order to design, implement and fully exploit future space programmes. In this context, potential synergies between the UN agenda Space2030 and the ESA Space 4.0 strategy are identified, focusing on four thematic priorities of UNISPACE+50: Global partnership in space exploration and innovation; Strengthened space cooperation for global health; International cooperation towards low emission and resilient societies; Capacity building for the twenty first century. Through these themes, the interplay and dependencies amongst key actors are identified, and a special emphasis is placed on future approaches of the diverse groups of stakeholders involved, leveraging the existing space infrastructure, institutions and networks while reinforcing and expanding their scope and effectiveness in ensuring that space becomes an important driver for sustainable development. For example, future integrated services will capture new citizen needs and target sustainable development goals, creating unprecedented opportunities for Europe worldwide. This will be enabled by Copernicus, Galileo and by the emergence of new satcom infrastructures for 5G, serving new markets by providing broadband connectivity to rural areas. Space is therefore increasingly becoming the link among systems of systems, and its enabling function may represent a key element actively contributing to a sustainable future on Earth.

This study explored the effect of innovation adoption on performance of banks in Ghana. Data for the study were obtained from 450 respondents comprising bank employees and customers in the Kumasi metropolitan area in Ghana. An exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation modeling were used to analyze the data via SmartPLS 3 and SPSS V.22. Findings from this study revealed that the innovation dimensions that contribute to bank innovation are organizational, product, process, and marketing innovations. The study further revealed a direct and positive relationship between innovation dimensions (product, marketing, and organizational innovations) and bank performance. In addition, findings from this study showed a positive relationship between innovation capability and the four dimensions of innovation (organizational, product, process, and market innovations). Also, the findings revealed a significant and positive relationship between the dimensions of innovation (market, process, and product innovations) and firm performance.

Chinese trends in R&D and patenting are compared to those of the countries of the 'triad' (the European Union, Japan and the US), as well as to those of other large emerging economies (Brazil, India, Mexico and South Africa). The analysis demonstrates how both in innovation inputs and outputs China reflects an innovation reality closer to that of the most developed areas of the world than to that of other emerging countries. However, the rapid ascent of Chinese innovation has generated a distinct set of territorial dynamics, with innovation much more geographically concentrated than elsewhere in the world and more reliant on agglomeration forces than on more traditional 'innovative' drivers. Such a distinct geography of innovation may have until now facilitated the innovation surge in China, but poses serious future risks in terms of the sustainability of the system.

For latecomer countries such as China, standards, and standardization are an important means to upgrade their industrial structure. Using the framework of a sectoral system of innovation, this article leverages China's hardware industry to investigate the relationships among factors that influence the performance of industrial upgrading via standards. Expert opinions and the decision making trial and evaluation laboratory method are used to evaluate the relationships. The evaluation results show that if some firms in a system have the capability to execute standardization and innovation, with the support of the government to build and shape standardization institutions and infrastructures, the knowledge and technological capabilities of the entire industry can be enhanced, leading to the gradual introduction of high-quality standardized products into markets by firms even as they move toward more knowledge-intensive segments. This article contributes to two academic fields. First, standards are an important but often neglected topic in the innovation system literature. This article not only investigates the neglected topic but also explores the mechanism through which standards influence industrial upgrading at the meso-level. Second, several previous studies assumed that the drivers of supplier upgrades in developing countries are mostly driven by powerful buyer firms that are based in advanced countries.

In the context of the high-quality development of regional integration, the management of Lake Taihu is facing more new, complex and difficult challenges. It highlights two aspects of the water environmental improvement and water resource supply. In detail, the separate management measures on lake and land cannot effectively solve the water problems, the management responsibility divided by administrative areas fails to meet the new requirements of regional integration, and the lack of mechanism of environmental integrated protection/harness and water resources protection/sharing, all of which actually become obstacles to the integrated development of the YRD region. This paper believes that the water deterioration of Lake Taihu is not limited to Lake Taihu itself but closely related to the Taihu Basin and the intensive human activities around. To promote the high-quality integrated development of the YRD region, the systematically management and governance of Lake Taihu should be improved out linking with the perspective of lake-basin system. It means to form a multi-factor coordination of resources, environment, ecology, society, and economy etc, and to achieve a coordinated management of land exploitation and water protection and a trade-off among economic, social and natural benefits in different sub-regions. Therefore the paper suggests several practical ways: First, the government concerned should explore the way to manage the complex lake-basin system with multiple factors, so as to promote the innovative thinking on the regional ecological and environmental integration; Second, put more effort on the research, development and application of key technology of lake-basin harness, and on the formation of comprehensive scientific system of lake-basin process simulation, evaluation and management, so as to promote the technological and scientific innovation in the field of ecological environment; And third, explore the mechanisms of resource and environmental protection/harness/sharing cooperation, and green development modes as well, so as to promote the institutional innovation of the integrated development.

However, few empirical studies explore this subject. In this context, we investigated how China's carbon emission trading (CET) policy promotes companies' total factor productivity (TFP) from the perspective of operational strategies, technological innovation, and market environment. Using the micro-data of listed companies from the Chinese stock A markets, we employed the difference-in-differences method to identify the CET policy's effect on companies' TFP. The benchmark regression results reveal that the policy has significantly boosted companies' TFP. Furthermore, the mechanism analysis shows that companies could enhance their TFP by promoting technological innovation instead of operational strategies. Meanwhile, the government can facilitate this improvement effect by optimizing the market environment. Moreover, the heterogeneity analysis of market failure demonstrated that it would affect the performance of the CET mechanism. Additionally, the CET scheme's effect on companies' TFP is heterogeneous in terms of industry, ownership, and region.

This study adds green innovation as mediator in the relationship between CSR and competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach A model with three second-order constructs is developed and tested, in a sample of 325 managers from manufacturing companies in Ecuador, using quantitative and cross-section methods. Findings After obtaining adjusted and validated measurement models, a structural equation model was conducted, where the main hypotheses were confirmed, providing empirical evidence that CSR and green innovation significantly influence manufacturing competitiveness in a developing economy. Research limitations/implications This study considers only manufacturing companies in Ecuador, focusing on CSR practices in a single territorial case study. It arguably contributes to reinforce the business case for CSR, with new evidence on the causal relationships between CSR, green innovation and competitiveness, in the context of emerging market manufacturing industries. Although the literature often points at a positive relationship between CSR and firm-level competitiveness, supporting empirical evidence remains scarce. This model, introducing green innovation as mediator in the relationship between CSR and competitiveness in developing markets, accounts for a novel theoretical approach. Practical implications The findings are consistent with previous research, reporting the positive influence of CSR activities on organizational competitiveness, reducing risks and cost structures, as well as improving the relationship with employees, enhancing talent attraction, retention and productivity. Incorporating formal CSR tools to the model allowed us to highlight the relevance of 'green' certifications as a means to provide a competitive edge, along with increased bargaining power in the supply chain, resulting in competitiveness gains. The findings on the role of green innovation suggest a transition from cost-savings to a more strategic leverage on responsible innovation as a source of competitive advantage. Social implications Additionally, this research contributes to shed light on the impact of green processes and product innovations on social and environmental performance, providing evidence of a more efficient use of energy and natural resources, increasing productivity and by extension, profitability. CSR shapes an innovation culture that, through the use of social, environmental and sustainability controllers, can create new business models, products, services or processes that boost both firm-level and supply chain productivity, benefits that eventually spill over to the host community.

Technological innovation has been repeatedly used as a means differentiation in order to achieve a higher enterprise competitiveness. This has led to achievement of great scientific and technical progress. Nevertheless, in the last few decades, this has not prevented some territories from social issues such as poverty, exclusion, inequality, deterioration of environmental conditions and unemployment, among others. All these problems have a high local impact, being here where social innovation importance as a force for potential change is growing. Despite the broad consensus regarding the potential and the positive effects that social innovation has in those territories, there is still considerable debate surrounding how this concept should be defined and what factors contribute to its appearance. There are many variables that have been mentioned in the literature; however, a review of previous works shows that it is an open field for the identification of new ones. As described above, this paper has three main aims: to analyze the state of the art up to now, to give a definition of social innovation and to identify, analyze and weigh those key factors for its emergence in the territories. To this end we have designed a methodology based on a series of qualitative analysis techniques. Firstly, a review of the state of the art has been carried out to obtain a first approximation to the concept of social innovation and determine which elements are decisive in its appearance. Secondly, based on the existing literature and knowing what the problem is, we complete the methodology by designing and conducting semi-structured interviews. We chose this technique because we understand that social innovation is a living and constantly evolving phenomenon. This makes it very useful and allows us to confront the ideas and evidence from our literature review in a pragmatic way. The information gathered from the interviews allow us to identify, in a reliable and empirical way, new key elements to define social innovation. Additionally, the interviews help us to recognize and weigh the existence of new essential factors for the development of social innovation. These interviews have been conducted with a total of 24 agents involved in social innovation processes: managers and directors of centers responsible for promoting social innovation; agents that developed socially innovative initiatives; and scientists and academics who published work in this field. To analyze the content of the 24 interviews, we used the Atlas.ti computer program. This tool helped us analyze the transcripts. In order to explore and interpret the texts we analyzed 24 primary archives, which represent one transcript for each interview carried out. Afterwards, we encoded them. This process is a form of data reduction, since, based on a large volume of information, we managed to segment certain pieces of information (quotes) and label them based on codes. These are the main elements of analysis and they are considered as a system of categories. In our case, each time we have identified a quote, which made reference to the existence of a factor that conditioned the irruption of social innovation or that enunciated characteristics that defined it, we labeled a code-referred to a certain factor related to the content of the quotes-. Once the individual coding and data editing was completed, we organized the codes into families. Specifically, in line with the main purposes of our analysis, in two families: one to collect the codes related to the definition of social innovation and a second to gather those related to its determinant factors. To provide our study with greater depth, it was essential to carry out a statistical analysis of the content that would allow us to know the frequency of appearance of the codes. First, we calculated the absolute frequency of the codes, referred to the number of times a quote was identified with the same code. Nevertheless, to obtain more information about the importance of each one of the codes, we relativized them considering that they had previously been divided into families. Thus, we have obtained the relative frequency by families, which is, the number of times any code is repeated within a family according to the total number of times codes included in that family appear. This contributes directly to know which factors have more strength in the emergence of social innovation, among the ones pointed out by the interviewers. After the performance of the aforementioned analysis, we suggest the following definition of social innovation: Practices or initiatives carried out by the community that, based on the products, services or models they generate, or through the process designed to achieve their objectives, they reach solutions that give a better response, in an alternative and creative way, to social problems or needs. In addition, we point out five key points for the development of social innovation: social and cultural elements; political and institutional support; knowledge and facilitating mechanisms; spatial components and entities; and mechanisms that determine the corporate and social productive structure. These gather 29 factors identified and weighted according to the number of times they were indicated by the interviewees. Therefore, this work, not only points out the key factors of social innovation and the foundations on which they are grouped by theme, but also shows the importance of each underlying determinant according to its absolute and relative frequencies. These frequencies are used as a proxy to weigh the importance of these factors and foundations. This allows to know which ones are more needed and have more weight in the emergence of social innovations. The ten factors with more impact are: the socioeconomic level of the population (0.09532), the existence of strategies and lines of action to develop social innovation (0.08838), the existence of laboratories or centers of social innovation (0.05892), the existence of public funding (0.05892), the existence of social concern (0.05719), the cultural propensity to change (0.05719), knowledge of the local reality (0.05545), knowledge of the opportunities and potential of new means and instruments (0.04506), links encouraging public-private relations (0.04332) and the existence of cooperatives (0.03986). In summary, it should be noted that the recognition of these factors, together with the weighing of their relative importance, represents a considerable innovation with respect to the existing texts. This work has allowed us to verify the suitability of some determining factors that had previously been pointed out in other studies, state new ones that emerged after the investigation, explain the correlation between them and present how important and what role each of them plays to have a beneficial ecosystem for social innovation.

However, from the perspective of Artificial Intelligence, education governance modernization is not only stuck in the 'structural' absence of multiple governance subjects, but also trapped in the 'initiative' shortage of vertical one-way organizational structure and the 'data' block of modern education governance paradigm. Thus, the application of Artificial Intelligence in intelligently mining data and information, autonomously adapting to complex educational situations, and systematically optimizing governance decisionmaking behavior is limited. This paper explores the optimized path of education governance from three dimensions of concept cultivation, subject training and technology innovation, rationally discusses the 'interactive' application of Artificial Intelligence and education governance modernization, so as to promote the deep integration of artificial intelligence and education governance, and improve education governance modernization as well as talent cultivation in the new era.

A comprehensive model of organizational level IT innovation adoption is presented based on a context-mechanism-outcome perspective and by drawing on relevant theories. The proposed model is empirically tested using data from 1988 company executives across a wide range of organizations globally. A research model and the related hypotheses are tested using structural equation modelling. The study found that organizational level IT innovation readiness conceptualized through technology readiness and internal expertise is a key mediator for successful organizational level technology adoption. Other organizational factors such as top management support, organizational structure, and organization culture, were positively related to the overall level of IT innovation readiness and organizational level technology adoption. Considering that there are many organizational factors that influence the adoption of technology, future research should extend the research framework and include additional variables that could support IT innovation adoption outcomes. The study makes a significant contribution to the existing literature by providing empirical evidence related to the organizational factors necessary for a successful IT innovation adoption at an organizational level.

Confirmatory factor analysis, hierarchical regression and path analysis were adopted to analyze the data. Findings This paper found that leader narcissism had a positive impact on team information search effort, thereby promoting team creativity, and the effect of leader narcissism on team information search effort is more positive in the context of high participation in decision making. Practical implications - Narcissism should be a noteworthy trait in manager selection and promotion especially for the departments and teams which focus on innovation and creation. And companies should pay attention to the team work processes to ensure that team members have the opportunity to participate in decision making for promoting the team leader's narcissistic bright side in the institutional environment and avoiding the dark side.

The objective of this paper is to explore the characteristics of this niche in relation to a range of existing modelling approaches and literatures with which it shares commonalities or from which it could draw. We distil a number of key aspects we think a transitions model should be able to address, from a broadly acknowledged, empirical list of transition characteristics. We review some of the main strands in modelling of socio-technological change with regards to their ability to address these characteristics. These are: Eco-innovation literatures (energy-economy models and Integrated Assessment Models), evolutionary economics, complex systems models, computational social science simulations using agent based models, system dynamics models and socio-ecological systems models. The modelling approaches reviewed can address many of the features that differentiate sustainability transitions from other socio-economic dynamics or innovations. The most problematic features are the representation of qualitatively different system states and of the normative aspects of change. The comparison provides transition researchers with a starting point for their choice of a modelling approach, whose characteristics should correspond to the characteristics of the research question they face. A promising line of research is to develop innovative models of co-evolution of behaviours and technologies towards sustainability, involving change in the structure of the societal and technical systems.

The demand for changes in learning from education and the market results in the creation of new educational practices such as Project-Based Learning (PBL). In this way, the emergence of new education practices aims to a greater retention of knowledge in the long term and a greater attractiveness of the content studied by the discipline. The objective of this article therefore is to present an application of the PSP4 discipline in the context of the PBL approach under the lens of the knowledge spiral. This is an exploratory research through a case study. The object of study was the discipline Production Systems Project 4 (PSP4), discipline of the 7th period of the undergraduate course in production engineering at the University of BrasÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­lia. The results show that the PSP4 discipline fulfills the core principles of theoretical learning in project-based learning, driving knowledge retention from the use of more mechanisms and conversions of knowledge than traditional teaching. In comparison to traditional teaching-conversions from externalization and internalization, the PBL also presented mechanisms of the conversions from the socialization and combination, completing the knowledge spiral.

Online news is unstructured narrative text that embeds facts, frames, and amplification that can influence society attitudes about technology adoption. Online news sources are carriers of voluminous amounts of news for reaching significantly large audience and have no geographical or time boundaries. The interplay of complex and dynamical forces among authors and readers allow for progressive emergent and latent properties to exhibit. Our concept of ""Double subjectivity"" provides a new paradigm for exploring complementary programmable insights of deeply buried meanings in a system. The ability to understand internal embeddedness in a large collection of related articles are beyond the reach of existing computational tools, and are hence left to human readers with unscalable results. This paper uncovers the potential to utilize advanced machine learning in a new way to automate the understanding of implicit structures and their associated latent meanings to give an early human-level insight into emergent technologies, with a concrete example of ""Uber"". This paper establishes the new concept of double subjectivity as an instrument for large-scale machining of unstructured text and introduces a social influence model for the discovery of distinct pathways into emerging technology, and hence an insight. The programmable insight reveals early spatial and temporal opinion shift monitoring in complex networks in a structured way for computational treatment and visualization.

It synthesizes the research in the current special issue (SI) of Multinational Business Review (MBR) on this topic. In addition, this paper differs from other work on this topic in examining entrepreneurship and innovation from a more global standpoint with relevant international effects. Design/methodology/approach The paper provides an overview of the literature on entrepreneurship, innovation and key related topics such as firm and economic growth, as well as linking this research to related international works. It also summarizes the papers of the SI. Findings The authors' analysis suggests that the study of entrepreneurship and innovation should be placed in the context of a country's economic development and institutional environment as well as the firm internationalization trajectories and business models. In addition, the authors believe that a good understanding of economic growth in a transition economy like China (which is a key goal of China's recent emphasis on innovation) is facilitated by understanding the comparative advantages and disadvantages of an economy with respect to the global innovation system. Originality/value The authors' study explores the local-global and parent-subsidiary connectivity and co-evolution of firm strategies and the institutional environment in entrepreneurship and innovation in emerging and transition economies. The authors summarize and synthesize the papers in this SI to provide the results as well as some directions for future research in the domain of entrepreneurship, innovation and new venture creation, which is believed to be a key engine of economic growth in the coming years.",2018,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/MBR-08-2018-0058,C2,6,2019,Journal,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.204337009,0.229438741,0.241232132,0,0,0,0.095440278,0,0.124361625,0,0,0,0,0.013230814,0,0.04826714,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.131480019,0.092910665,0,0,0.042833608,0,0,0,0.350001411,0.132744017,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.143284177,0.111457292,0,0.358210441,0.079311163,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.117091072,0.045062474,0,0,0,0.137063448,0,0,0,0.501112168,0.144033432,0.117293357,0,0.167625145,0,0.089083073,0,0,0,0,0,0.065823373,0,0.141058795,0,0.073342979,0.190366819,0.101607268,0.115053589,0.198265679,0,,,,1,1,1,1,,,,,51

Such technology has prompted enterprises to adjust intraorganizational boundaries to promote innovation and respond immediately to market demand. The phenomenon in which an organization adjusts its departments to promote innovation is not only a management strategy developed for improving competitiveness, but also the key to survival in the market. The information software service industry has experienced rapid advancements in technology, ever-changing operating environments, and high uncertainty. Therefore, this study targeted the information software service industry to explore how organizations in the industry punctually adjust organizational structures and resource allocation to promote innovation. In response to market demand, division of works across different departments within an organization is affected. Interdepartmental communication and negotiation have become prevalent. Organizational members use information and communications technology and the Internet to contact and interact with each other. Such behaviours lead to flat or virtual organizations and blur organizational boundaries. This study aimed to understand how Internet technology has changed organizational innovation. In academic theory, contingency theory is suitable for examining changes in organizational design in the face of environmental changes or technology evolution. Woodward (1965) applied contingency theory to reinforce conventional business models, asserting that organizational structures change under the effect of technology. Early scholars studying organizational structures have focused mostly on discussion of organizational design structures. For example, Weber (1946) claimed bureaucracy is the most reasonable and efficient organizational type. Subsequently, Burns and Stalker (1961) divided organization types into mechanistic and organic. Mechanistic organizations feature stricter bureaucracy and rigid regulations. By contrast, organic organizations allow flexible working methods. In addition to adjustment to organizational structures, the present study further referenced the research of organizational function boundary by Santos and Eisenhardt (2005), which proposed four dimensions, namely cost efficiency, autonomous power, consistency identity, and growth competence. From this perspective, the present study explored the effect of Internet technology on relevant dimensions. To further explore the effect of Internet technology on organizational boundaries, this study adopted a qualitative case interview method. The most representative information software service firms in the market were examined, including ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â company, which is renowned for its antivirus software, and International Business Machines Corporation-Taiwan, which specializes in hardware and software integration. During long-term innovative development procedures, this study performed observations on the case firms' design of organizational boundaries and personnel interaction processes between the research and development department, which is responsible for innovation, and the information department, which is in charge of managing information and communications technology applications. The results of this study can serve as a reference for applying conventional theory regarding organizational function boundaries theory to emerging industries, thereby creating measures for coping with rapid changes in market trends brought about by Internet technology. In addition, the study results can facilitate adjustments to or further elaboration on operational definitions or research dimensions in existing theories.

Ambidextrous organizations excel at exploiting existing products to enable incremental innovation and at exploring new opportunities to foster more radical innovation, yet related research is limited. Largely conceptual, anecdotal, or single case studies offer architectural or contextual approaches. Architectural ambidexterity proposes dual structures and strategies to differentiate efforts, focusing actors on one or the other form of innovation. In contrast, contextual approaches use behavioral and social means to integrate exploitation and exploration. To develop a more comprehensive model, we sought to learn from five, ambidextrous firms that lead the product design industry. Results offer an alternative framework for examining exploitation-exploration tensions and their management. More specifically, we present nested paradoxes of innovation: strategic intent (profit-breakthroughs), customer orientation (tight-loose coupling), and personal drivers (discipline-passion). Building from innovation and paradox literature, we theorize how integration and differentiation tactics help manage these interwoven paradoxes and fuel virtuous cycles of ambidexterity.

Design/methodology/approach: The research had a quantitative and descriptive focus and used as methodology the validated and international approach known as Innovation Radar. Findings: The degree of innovation in these micro and small companies is low; thus, the authors could not characterize them as systemic innovators. Most of them are little innovative, although some were classified as occasional innovators. The dimensions organization, processes, presence, supply chain and added value were the least developed. Research limitations/implications: To carry out similar studies in other Brazilian regions, to compare results and draw new conclusions, or even check if the degree of innovation present in micro-firms of these regions would not be even lower; to monitor the evolution of companies through a longitudinal study, to detect improvements in the degree of innovation; and to conduct a qualitative research that can deepen questions on the results of our study, such as the reasons why this type of company does not adopt innovative practices, or even the real suitability of the Innovation Radar model for micro and small enterprises (MSEs). We observed that some dimensions proved to be too sophisticated for these companies, such as R&D investments and the adoption of technological advances. Practical implications: The study shows that the degree of innovation measured by the Innovation Radar is a useful and initial measure to check an innovative attitude in micro and small companies. It can also drive the actions that should be prioritized to stimulate the culture of innovation in SME. However, it does not allow to answer why this type of organization does not adopt innovative practices as a management attitude. Regarding its contribution, the authors expect that the paper may bring an awareness of managers and owners of micro and small companies for the need to foster innovative practices that can help increase the competitiveness and survival of this type of organization. Social implications: In Brazil, despite the fact that MSEs represent 98 per cent of the existing companies, and are mainly responsible for job creation, their leaders have a low concern for innovative practices. Originality/value: The study contributes to identify the degree of innovation of these firms, which comprise a representative and strategic segment of the cityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s economy, by checking to what extent an innovative attitude is effectively present in this sector. The theoretical contribution of this study regards the appropriateness of mechanisms or methodologies created to measure the degree of innovation in large organizations. Dimensions such as technological platform, brand, innovative ambience, degree of organization or systematization of processes, which are frequently considered for companies in general, and especially for large ones, are not sufficient or, instead, too sophisticated to allow an effective measurement of the degree of innovation in MSE. Thus, this study provides information for designing more effective ways to evaluate the degree of innovation that take into account MSEÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s specificities, which can be considered innovation efforts, such as simple process improvements, professional development of teams, and actions to seize ideas and opportunities, among others.

Design/methodology/approach - In total, 213 valid questionnaires from SMEs' top management positions were evaluated to investigate the proposed model of the research empirically. As a methodological approach, partial least square (PLS) path modeling approach, a variance-based structural equation modeling was employed. Findings - The statistical results imply that explorative learning has a positive impact on improvisational creativity and innovation while improvisational creativity has a positive influence on compositional creativity and innovation as well. Compositional creativity and innovation are also positively associated. Surprisingly, improvisational creativity mediates the relationship between explorative learning and innovation. Furthermore, PLS-multi group analysis reveals that heterogeneity exists in the collected data and number of employees is a moderating variable. The results of the research indicate that companies with number of employees between 51 and 100 are more creative and innovative in comparison with other groups. On the other hand, the positive relationship between explorative learning and compositional creativity was not supported in this research.

An online survey has been carried out among managers of PDPs to explore the strategic decisions to develop and diffuse knowledge. The findings reveal that the knowledge developed at PDPs and diffused in PDP contexts tends to focus on the development of technological knowledge at lower stages of technological maturity, while activities related to non-technological knowledge and system build-up were given less importance.

For start-ups, which are restricted by their own limited resources, it is wise to take inbound open innovation as a strategy to get external advanced technical information quickly. However, how to match technology resources obtained from outside with the organisation's demand is still a problem for entrepreneurial teams and entrepreneurial researchers. Based on the literature review of existing research and considering entrepreneurial teams' demand to deal with the challenges, this paper firstly analyses the relationship between entrepreneurial teams' inbound open innovation strategy and the innovative use of information technology by individuals in teams of start-ups and based on the Identity Theory to explore the mechanism of IT identity on the relationship mentioned above. Lastly, the paper further analyses two types of team authorisation (structural empowerment and psychological empowerment) that play different moderating roles in the relationship of inbound open innovation, IT identity and the innovative use of information technology by individuals in teams. Using 238 survey data from entrepreneurial teams with linear regression analysis, we found that IT identity moderates the relationship between inbound open innovation and individual new IT technology exploration positively, and team psychological empowerment has further moderated the relationship between inbound open innovation and the innovative use of information technology by individuals in teams positively, while team structure empowerment plays an inverted U-shaped moderation.

Although diversity is natural for an emerging field such as circular economy, building consensus of terminology and archetypes is important to achieve a shared discourse, which is fundamental for the implementation of business models. By reviewing academic and practical literature, this article systematises twenty archetypes of business models for circular economy, according to a framework focused on downstream and upstream architecture, and the type of value delivered, created or captured. Additionally, it proposes a way to evaluate the application of the archetypes in practice, through a deck of cards to support companies in identifying opportunities, generating ideas, and prioritising business models for circular economy. The application of the archetype cards in six manufacturing companies resulted in four key findings: (i) existing archetypes hold a reductionist approach with limited attention to the downstream value logic; (ii) the archetypes' application in practice requires sectorial contextualisation, harmonisation of the abstraction level and standardisation of archetypes' structure; (iii) there was a lack of detailed guidelines for archetype selection and combination; and (iv) the action research approach enables the exploration of radical innovation for circular economy business models.",2020,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.105029,C7,5,2022,Journal,0,0,0.168147156,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.161530677,0,0,0.487558973,0,0,0.017243954,0.139609042,0.12581484,0,0,0,0.162519658,0,0.128499273,0.171906267,0.134637736,0,0,0,0,0.139564503,0,0,0,0,0.173007633,0.12745525,0,0,0,0.078710946,0.082119445,0,0,0.136519722,0.13614039,0,0,0,0.116967274,0,0,0.144849195,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.058730721,0,0,0.168675327,0.178637224,0.147366719,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.072822942,0,0.174155325,0,0.156264635,0.125062061,0,0,0,0,0.091922215,0.511468693,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,,1,21

Design/methodology/approach: This study used structural equation modelling to test the data from 3,125 engineering professionals in the Australian Public Service (APS). Findings: The structural model indicated that leadership for innovation and ambidextrous culture for innovation influenced workplace innovation which, in turn, improved career satisfaction. Moreover, modelling revealed a significant relationship between ambidextrous culture for innovation and career satisfaction. This study also investigated mediation effects and revealed both simple and sequential mediation paths in the model. It was found that improving workplace innovation and career satisfaction through recognition of an engineerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s contribution to their agency would assist in retaining and advancing in-house engineering expertise. Practical implications: The structural model could be used to address current shortages of engineering professionals in the Commonwealth of Australia departments. The findings emphasise the importance of Commonwealth departments providing opportunities for their engineers to engage in creative and innovative projects which enhance their professional career. Originality/value: This study fills the gap in the innovation literature by exploring the relationships through which socio-psychological factors affect workplace innovation and career satisfaction on the innovation process for engineering professionals in the APS.

However, this kind of traditional formal institutional arrangement inevitably has some natural restrictions and limitations. For examples, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s usually with strong universality while weak pertinence, lack of timeliness due to long application period, or difficult to find due to high cost of supervision. Those make the formal institutional arrangements not always protect the intellectual property rights well enough on some special occasions. Especially in the context of industrial cluster, the knowledge spillover is particular high due to the multidimensional proximity of society, geography, institution, organization, and cognition. Thus, there are quick imitations of products in some clusters. The traditional protection mode of patents and copyrights could not offer essential protection for intellectual property rights in the clusters because of the high requirements, the long application period, the difficulty in discovery and the trouble in litigation, which result in frequent infringement of intellectual property in clusters. That seriously harms the innovation enthusiasm and innovation vitality of cluster enterprises. Hence, in some clusters, those cluster firms have been taking collective actions based on the local conditions and industries with the help of industry association platform to protect intellectual property rights. Such an action is also called a collective action of right safeguarding (CARS) in practice. This kind of collective action plays a significant auxiliary function together with formal institutional arrangements to protect the intra cluster IPR. We are curious about what exact effects industry associations have on CARS of cluster firms. Why are there such effects? And what are the inner mechanisms by which industry associations affect CARS of cluster firms? Literature review shows that thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s still no systematic discussion of those questions in the extant literatures. In view of the above situations, this paper is going to explore the above questions in the following four steps based on the prior researches. First, this paper defines the key constructs including the industry associationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s governance of IPR (IAGOIPR) and CARS. Second, theory building and hypothesis development are conducted. The specific effects of IAGOIPR on cluster firmsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â² CARS and the mediating roles of innovation legitimacy (IL) in the aforementioned relationship are discussed. And the corresponding hypotheses are developed as well. Third, the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is used to identify the best fit model, and the developed hypotheses are tested by the best fit model with SEM. Lastly, in combination of alternative measurements and alternative logit regression, the robustness of the results is tested to confirm the findings. By doing so, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s expected to reveal the relationship between IAGOIPR and CARS, and the internal linking mechanism between them. As a result, three findings are emerged. Firstly, the IAGOIPR can effectively promote cluster enterprises to participate in and carry out CARS. The IAGOIPR activities include service governance, coordination governance and self-discipline governance. The more efficient the activities are, the higher the efficiency of the intellectual property governance of the industry association, the higher the willingness and enthusiasm of the cluster enterprises to participate in the CARS, and the better the efficiency of intellectual property protection in the cluster. From this point of view, this paper proves that the efficiency of intellectual property protection in industrial clusters is closely related to the efficiency of the local industry associationsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â² intellectual property governance. Secondly, the IAGOIPR helps improve the innovation legitimacy of cluster enterprises (regulatory innovation legitimacy, normative innovation legitimacy and cognitive innovation legitimacy). That is to say, the IAGOIPR activities in the cluster can raise the cluster enterprisesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â² awareness to abide by laws and regulations, social ethics and peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s cognitive laws in their innovation activities or innovation process, so that the innovation behavior and innovation achievements of the cluster enterprises are satisfactory in the local social constructing value, norms and definition system. Thirdly, the regulatory innovation legitimacy and the cognitive innovation legitimacy play mediating roles in the relationship between the IAGOIPR and the CARS of cluster enterprises. This means that the IAGOIPR stimulates the CARS partly through the mediation of the regulatory innovation legitimacy or cognitive innovation legitimacy. The mediating role of the cognitive innovation legitimacy is the most significant, whereas the mediating effect of the regulatory innovation legitimacy ranks the second. However, the hypothesized mediating effect of the normative innovation legitimacy is not supported by the empirical research.

MI can improve Internet of Things (IoT) in several ways, such as optimizing the management of large volumes of data or improving automation and transmission in large-scale IoT deployments. When considering MI in the IoT context, MI services deployment must account for the latency demands and network bandwidth requirements. To this extent, moving the intelligence towards the IoT end-device aims to address such requirements and introduces the notion of Distributed MI (D-MI) also in the IoT context. However, current D-MI deployments are limited by the lack of MI interoperability. Currently, the intelligence is tightly bound to the application that exploits it, limiting the provisioning of that specific intelligence service to additional applications. The objective of this article is to propose a novel approach to cope with such constraints. It focuses on decoupling the intelligence from the application by revising the traditional device's stack and introducing an intelligence layer that provides services to the overlying application layer. This paradigm aims to provide final users with more control and accessibility of intelligence services by boosting providers' incentives to develop solutions that could theoretically reach any device. Based on the definition of this emerging paradigm, we explore several aspects related to the intelligence distribution and its impact in the whole MI ecosystem.",2019,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MCI.2019.2937613,C13,1,2022,Journal,0,0,0.128281152,0,0,0,0,0,0.348011366,0,0,0,0,0,0.083536181,0,0,0,0,0,0.10591284,0.102149882,0.026311171,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.212950319,0,0,0,0.290009472,0.131989259,0,0,0.086217102,0,0.06004937,0.062649748,0.340220726,0,0,0,0,0.599555612,0,0.178471013,0,0,0,0,0.078860214,0,0,0,0.05973066,0,0.103287453,0,0,0.044806257,0.048966077,0,0,0.068142065,0.112427548,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.199144471,0,0.095411101,0,0,0.032724557,0,0,0.156081838,0.218777891,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,1,1,28

Drawing on knowledge management theory, we propose that knowledge transfer plays a mediating role underlying the relationship.

Additionally, in their relationship with multinational enterprises (MNEs), SMEs are driven to a continuous specialization of their knowledge and technological resource bases. They so source global knowledge by positioning along a global value chain of those MNES. Especially SMEs employ a repositioning organizational knowledge dynamics by functional upgrading and downgrading strategy. In order to address the query on dynamic capabilities in knowledge management (KM) in different inter-organizational collaborations in the global value chain, this study shows that the choice between functional upgrading or downgrading can determine a more effective cross-innovation strategy which enables SMEs to exploit external paths to the market by revealing or selling their ideas, knowledge and technologies. Such strategies can reveal opportunities for SMEs to increase their network to find an optimum position in the market.

We use directly observed indicators of cross-regional knowledge application within the firm as well as examine collaborative mechanisms that firms may use to promote such knowledge translation. Design/methodology/approach - Our analysis is based upon successful patents in biotechnology sector applied for during 2011-2014. The empirical assessment follows a mixed method approach. The sample used for testing the empirical hypotheses is composed of 130,720 patents from 860 large US firms. The sample of patents was obtained from USPTO and NBER dataset. Findings - The idea of this paper was to introduce a model specifically developed for the process of knowledge translation. This research contributes to the literature related to the emergent and new issue namely collaborative knowledge translation (CKT), especially emphasizing the key role of the knowledge translation practices and tools for the internationalization of R&D teams and supporting the quality of innovations in different ways. Originality/value - This research is conceptually based on the broader concepts of spiral of knowledge of Nonaka and Takeuchi. In spite of the increasing research in innovation, few studies have been done about the diverse contexts' role in the knowledge flows supporting the innovation development.

The goal of this study is to explore and characterize searchers' knowledge change patterns in the context of learning-related tasks from a process perspective. A user experiment was conducted, and participants were asked to search for two learning-related search tasks in a laboratory environment, and draw mind maps before and during search to keep a record of what they know about the task. Searchers' knowledge change behaviors during the search process were extracted from their mind maps and analyzed based on the ""Actions-Tactics-Strategies (ATS)"" research path. In this study, we report current preliminary analysis, which discovered twenty-five types of knowledge change actions, and identified eight types of knowledge change tactics using bottom-up clustering methods. The findings are the basis for our further exploration of searchers' learning strategies during the whole session, also present a complete behavioral and cognitive picture of searchers' knowledge change process, for search systems providing assistance at different stages of searching and learning.

This implies transformative shifts in understanding as conceptualised by the idea of 'double'- or 'triple-loop learning'. Achieving this can be difficult as communities often rely on shorter-term coping mechanisms that purport to maintain the status quo. The use of participatory scenario planning to stimulate forward-looking social learning for adaptation was investigated through three contrasting community case studies on natural resource management in Latin America (in Mexico, Argentina and Colombia). Exploratory scenario narratives that synthesised local knowledge and future perceptions were used iteratively to define response options considered robust across multiple futures. Despite its intensive format, participants in each case agreed that scenario planning enabled a more systematic appraisal of the future. Scenarios facilitated innovation by providing scope to propose new types of responses and associated actions. Differences in local context meant that learning about future change developed in diverse ways, showing a need for a reflexive process. Reframing of key issues characteristic of double-loop learning did occur, albeit through different forms of interaction in each location. However, a shift towards transformative actions characteristic of triple-loop learning was less evident. Achieving this would appear to require ongoing use of scenarios to challenge social norms in light of changing drivers. Use of learning loops as a diagnostic to evaluate adaptive responses provided a useful reference framework although in practice both innovation and consolidative approaches can develop concurrently for responses to different issues.",2016,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-015-0898-7,C14,1,2009,,0.45805643,0,0,0,0.148266217,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.183141708,0,0,0,0.14269369,0,0.086759798,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.185687837,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.155860746,0,0,0,0,0.149045623,0,0,0,0.541929519,0,0.161317329,0,0,0,0,0,0.380793552,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.044259719,0.21615911,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.059158493,0,0,0.282160166,0,0.171091416,0,0,0,0,1,,,,1,,1,,,1,1,13

We focused on oral dialects from traditional fishing practitioners, local community leaders and fishers as efficient respondents to carry out the study. In addition, we also attempted to develop a template of seasonal ecological calendar based on ecological indicators of Tamil Nadu coastline. This conceptualisation can also be absorbed on a synoptic scale as an integration framework of ITEK and scientific innovations. On the other perspective, it is so factual that adaptation of ITEKs in the current decades is in verge of extinction due to several factors such as modernization, technological advancements and waning intergenerational knowledge transmissions. In the face of losing ITEKs, it is crucial to integrate ITEKs in the scientific seasonal forecasting of environmental changes and climatic events to facilitate better decision making policies on adaptation and mitigation strategies. It is highly essential to build the concept of conservation and documentation of ITEK to solve the climate crisis and effective decision making. In the recent years, the approach of integrating biophysical and social sciences on understanding earth science is an emerging concept to enhance climate knowledge. Application and integration of ITEKs with scientific ecological modelling systems possess tremendous potential to develop accurate scientific forecasts and reliable future predictions.

Emerging industries based on technological innovation have increasingly become an important driving force for industrial competitiveness and economic growth. Although regional innovation systems (RISs) boost regional industries, it remains under-investigated whether and how RISs have differential impacts on different industries. Inspired by Pavitt's taxonomy of sectorial innovation, we propose four paradigms of industrial innovation in the context of emerging industries in China. We also empirically explore the effects of RISs on emerging industries, distinguishing the short-term effects from long-term ones. We present two key findings. First, RISs have generally contributed to the growth of emerging industries in China. Second, different components of RISs have varied impacts on different emerging industries. The results provide both theoretical underpinnings and empirical evidence for policy-makers, suggesting that well-designed policies that leverage RIS formation and regional industry specific characteristics are vitally important for development of emerging industries. Our study makes three important contributions. First, it theorizes a conceptual framework on possible mechanism through which RISs promote emerging industries. Second, this study sheds empirical light on both short-term and long-term effects of individual RIS components on seven emerging industries in the Chinese context.

Design/methodology/approach This paper adopts an interpretive and exploratory case study on the business model innovation of Yimu Technology Company Limited (Yimu Tech) from product standardization to customization. Considering that this innovation reflects a successful down-up rather than traditional up-down innovation, this paper focuses on it to explore how the most micro routines affect the whole process of innovation. Almost two years were spent in collecting data from Yimu Tech and in following the innovation through approaches of semi-structured interviews, archival data and observation; the data were analyzed through a five-step process before a framework showing the paradoxical effects was finally set up. Findings This research specifies the construct of organizational routines and promotes a five-dimensional concept covering the organizational, collective and individual levels of an organization. It confirms the interaction between the performative and ostensive aspects of routines, by showing that the ostensive aspect may not only guide tasks performing but also allow multiple changes, and the performative aspect may affect the ostensive aspect through the down-up or up-down path. Also, it finds that routines may paradoxically affect all three phases of innovation, with a strong up-down hindering effect but a weak down-up promoting effect in the preparation phase, a strong down-up promoting effect but a weak hindering effect in the emergence phase and both significant effects in the consolidation phase. Research limitations/implications This research is constrained by several limitations. The set up framework of routines and their paradoxical effects on innovation need a further confirmation in more contexts or organizations; more elements should be considered in exploring the evolution of routines and their effects on innovations; little attention has been paid to the relationship between these two types of effects, conflicting with each other, joining together or working independently. Originality/value The findings offered some valuable insights for further research on organizational routines and organizational innovation and hold important implications for management practices. This research enriched the two-aspect view of routines by constructing a five-dimensional framework; further research studies on routine dynamics by showing the interaction between the performative and ostensive aspects can contribute to the study on effects of organizational routines on innovations by showing how routines promote and hinder innovation simultaneously throughout the whole process.

Recent research demonstrates the crucial role of integration mechanisms (i.e. how knowledge exchange between exploratory and exploitative units can be organized) and related transition modes (i.e. how exploratory innovations can ultimately be transferred back into the exploitative structures of core business) to deal with this challenge. However, a systematic account of the diverse tensions, risks, and trade-offs associated with integration which may ultimately cause exploration failure is missing, so far. This paper presents a longitudinal process study uncovering the anatomy of an unsuccessful exploration of (green) technologies by a medium-sized entrepreneurial firm. We investigated their transition processes to understand how the managers dynamically configured and reconfigured the exploration-exploitation interface over time. Our theoretical contribution lies in providing a framework of six integration trade-offs (Exploratory-complementary linking vs. contamination; Seeking legitimacy early on vs. frustration at discontinuation of innovation; Boundary spanning through job rotation vs. carrying over of old culture; Early vs. premature transfer; Reorganization vs. capability mutation; and Improved access to core business resources vs. resource starvation) linked to three phases in the transition process (before, at, and after transfer). We also highlight mechanism, pulling-forward, and streamlining-related failures linked to integration trade-offs in resource-constrained contexts. Our implication for R&D and top management is that the use of integration mechanisms for structural ambidexterity bears the risk of cross-contamination between the exploitative and exploratory structures and are therefore inevitably linked to trade-offs. To minimize negative side effects and prevent exploration failure, organizations have to consciously select, schedule, operationalize, and manage (re)integration mechanisms along the transition process. Our framework of integration trade-offs systematically supports managers in their organizational design choices for integration mechanisms in the transition processes.",2019,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/radm.12339,C20,9,2017,Journal,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.082159237,0,0.080787583,0,0,0.745459921,0.118328357,0.067210876,0.087279563,0,0,0,0.075012362,0,0.009317393,0,0.067981293,0.07759897,0,0,0,0.127413362,0.069431767,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.030164249,0.07826609,0.08835382,0,0.082159237,0.093480885,0,0.15129427,0.061062931,0,0.085059471,0,0,0.05839291,0,0,0.062203185,0,0.070002025,0,0.050451734,0.235471094,0,0,0.111704887,0.074593414,0,0.329831121,0.08460802,0,0,0,0,0.095201577,0,0,0,0.048261355,0.079626378,0,0.065604912,0,0.050715554,0.12390035,0,0,0.045198016,0.18820203,0,0.084434172,0,0,0,0.023177041,0.080553273,0,0,0.051649533,0,0,0,0.069811249,0,,,,1,1,,,,1,,,6

The SOEs suppose provide employment, meet social and political needs, and operate in the sectors of the economy that are of strategic importance to the state. Therefore, SOEs are critical to economic development in emerging economies. The pace of change confronting organizations today has added complexity to the organizational landscape and now calls for more flexible and adaptive leadership. Adaptive leaders can work more effectively in the unstable global business environment and are also able to adopt a proactive approach in order to keep abreast of the increasing stakeholder pressures in the enterprises. However, inadequate applicability of traditional leadership models has indicated the need to develop new leadership models to solve the complex organizational challenges. Hence complexity leadership approach seeks to combine these dynamics to the bureaucratic hierarchies in order to explain the way informal organizational dynamics function correctly and also to describe how these valuable adaptive functions can be promoted to better the operations of SOEs in Ghana",2019,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.17583/ijelm.2019.3647,C10,2,2020,Journal,0,0,0,0.089166013,0,0.228955778,0,0,0.105798507,0.092650557,0,0,0,0.719960553,0.076187194,0,0.224784158,0.169164272,0,0.226160411,0,0.093163379,0,0,0.043770607,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.093680131,0,0,0.096866668,0,0.233059551,0,0,0,0,0,0.1773652,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.094725669,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.054475933,0,0.094200874,0,0.106182948,0,0.066987526,0,0,0.062147356,0,0,0,0.090885781,0,0.053183194,0,0.050669767,0,0.080784155,0.121083331,0,0.261052301,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.086316189,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,1,8

We refer to these approaches, all of which aim to support the design of farming systems, as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“farmer innovation trackingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. There is still a lack of knowledge, however, about the specificities of the approaches adopted to track innovations and how they contribute to design processes. To explore these questions, we studied 14 initiatives in France led by actors from different R&D networks. We analysed the data collected using agronomy and design science concepts. Three outcomes emerge from this work. (1) We shed light on the common features of innovation tracking. We outline five stages that structure all the approaches: formulating an innovation tracking project, unearthing innovations, learning about them, analysing them, and generating agronomic content. (2) We characterize six contributions of farmer innovation tracking to design processes: giving rise to creative anomalies, shedding light on systemic mechanisms to fuel design processes on other farms, uncovering research questions, stimulating design in orphan fields of innovation, circulating innovation concepts, and connecting farmer-designers with each other. (3) Finally, we highlight three tracking strategies: the targeted tracking of proven practices, the targeted tracking of innovations under development, and the exploratory tracking of proven practices. This article is the first to propose a theorization of the farmer innovation tracking approaches, thus enriching the agronomic foundations supporting farming system design. The purpose of our paper is not to provide a turnkey method, but to highlight concepts, mechanisms, and points of reference for actors who might wish to develop farmer innovation tracking in different contexts in the future. By revealing their contributions to design processes, this article seeks to contribute to the institutionalization of innovation tracking.

Despite this attention, however, the question of how firms can better maintain the balance of exploration and exploitation remains unresolved. Drawing on a wide range of research on population and organization structure, we argue that an organization divided into semi-isolated subgroups may help strike this balance. We simulate such an organization, systematically varying the interaction pattern between individuals to explore how the degree of subgroup isolation and intergroup connectivity influences organizational learning. We also test this model with a range of contingency variables highlighted in the management research. We find that moderate levels of cross-group linking lead to the highest equilibrium performance by enabling superior ideas to diffuse across groups without reducing organizational diversity too quickly. This finding is remarkably resilient to a wide range of variance in factors such as problem complexity, environmental dynamism, and personnel turnover.",2010,,,C10,9,2017,Journal,0.098957278,0.046559265,0.050099678,0.038182475,0.160155172,0.098042941,0,0,0,0.039674618,0.044548438,0.046838274,0.043405893,0.462449894,0.065249427,0.111185633,0.04812829,0,0,0.338960703,0,0.039894218,0,0.249580248,0.05623006,0.085580302,0.128736761,0,0.096845915,0.070259141,0.076573073,0.153659132,0,0.051057022,0.216477388,0.041480032,0,0.324350813,0,0.097441327,0,0.067957207,0,0,0.083427714,0.101015208,0.050574383,0.093808142,0.024467603,0,0,0.040676241,0,0,0,0.038600992,0.034850562,0.027820438,0.04328169,0.172632075,0.055640875,0,0.205664035,0,0.045469429,0.139965387,0.050734368,0,0,0,0.0524967,0.019123501,0,0.050257048,0.026612604,0,0.043034875,0,0,0,0.022773991,0,0,0,0.069186428,0.077775058,0.09311853,0,0.273620583,0,0.012780442,0,0.082165055,0.060957123,0,0.073924258,0.039456676,0.178712893,0,0,1,,,,,,1,,,,1,1

Design/methodology/approach - Based on relevant literature review on NPD performance, a structured questionnaire was developed to collect data related to NPD performance measures. Questionnaires were distributed to a sample of 558 manufacturing organisations in Jordan, out of which 355 were returned and valid for the analysis. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were applied to reveal NPD performance success dimensions that manufacturing organisations use to assess NPD performance success. Then, path analysis was employed to examine the research model and test its hypotheses. Findings - The study's findings reveal that manufacturing organisations use a multidimensional construct for assessing NPD performance success, which consists of NPD financial performance, NPD internal learning, NPD capabilities improvement, NPD knowledge sharing, and NPD marketing performance. NPD capabilities improvement exerted a positive and significant effect on each of NPD internal learning, NPD knowledge sharing, and NPD marketing performance, respectively. NPD knowledge sharing exerted a positive and significant effect on each of NPD internal learning NPD marketing performance. Each of NPD internal learning and NPD marketing performance exerted a positive and significant effect on NPD financial performance. The structural findings also indicate that 38.1 per cent (R2 is 0.381) of NPD financial performance is explained by the path of NPD capabilities improvement, NPD knowledge sharing and NPD marketing performance, which is the strongest path in the empirical model. Research limitations/implications - The paper's focus on manufacturing organisations limits its contribution to the manufacturing sector only. The services sector is a rich field for understanding NPD financial performance enablers in various service industries. Further, the paper focusses on only five dimensions of NPD performance success, other dimensions of NPD performance success might add more insights to their effect on NPD performance success measures especially their effect on organisational performance. Practical implications - The findings of this study provide managers of manufacturing organisations with empirical insights related to the multidimensionality of NPD and their complex relationships to enhance NPD financial performance. The empirical findings assist managers to assess their NPD strategies, processes and implementation based on a results-oriented approach. The major contribution of the study is identifying the strongest paths of NPD financial performance enablers which reveals the complexity and criticality of NPD capabilities improvement, NPD knowledge sharing and NPD marketing performance on NPD financial performance. The rationale is NPD financial performance is still the most important NPD performance success dimension amongst manufacturing organisations. Originality/value - The originality of this paper stems from developing and testing a multidimensional model of NPD financial performance enablers for the first time in emerging markets, Jordan. NPD financial performance is a function of other areas of NPD performance dimensions, namely; NPD capabilities improvement, NPD knowledge sharing and NPD marketing performance. This empirical evidence is provided to managers for the first time by this study.",2018,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJQRM-08-2016-0122,C9,4,2020,Conference Paper,0,0,0,0,0.181781012,0.139102165,0,0,0.064277921,0.450319034,0.252819186,0,0.123167536,0.437412294,0.092575115,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.01457907,0.118033835,0,0,0.121766796,0.292542002,0,0,0,0,0,0.144878198,0,0.353108274,0,0.070797707,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.109533263,0,0,0,0,0.157885232,0,0,0,0.129022977,0,0,0,0.135739999,0,0,0,0,0,0.075515297,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.184706613,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.145061915,0,0.077716539,0,0,0,0,0,0.218469502,0.099154183,,,,1,1,,1,,,1,1,5

A multivariate regression model is designed to explore the impact of external institutional pressure (i.e. coercive pressure, mimetic pressure and normative pressure) on open innovation, as well as the moderating effect of digital knowledge and experience-based knowledge. Findings The results show that institutional pressure has a positive role in promoting open innovation; digital knowledge weakens the positive relationship between institutional pressure and open innovation; experience-based knowledge strengthens the positive relationship between institutional pressure (especially coercive pressure) and open innovation.

We address this gap by examining the antecedents and consequences of knowledge hiding climate using two studies. We explore the role that human resource (HR) practices play as an antecedent of firm knowledge hiding, and the influence knowledge hiding has on innovation and firm performance. We find HR practices contribute to a lower climate of knowledge hiding and leadership trust interacts to discourage knowledge hiding further.

Prior studies have indicated that Business Model Innovation (BMI) is a core driver for firm's survival and superior performance especially in growing industries. However, the role of BMI has been discussed theoretically and exploratory while empirical studies are still lacking. Hence, this study examines the importance of BMI in SME performance and the mediating role of competitive advantage. Data were collected through structured questionnaires using a sample size of 303 manufacturing SMEs operating in the emerging market of Pakistan. Hypotheses were tested through Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) using AMOS.21. The results indicate that BMI has a significant positive impact on competitive advantage and SME performance. Competitive advantage partially mediates the relationship between BMI and SME performance. Firms are required to create an effective business model to acquire competitive advantage and superior financial performance. Implications for practice have been discussed.

Inspired by its successes and promises, several AI ecosystems are blossoming, many of them within the domain of materials science and engineering. These materials intelligence ecosystems are being shaped by several independent developments. Machine learning (ML) algorithms and extant materials data are utilized to create surrogate models of materials properties and performance predictions. Materials data repositories, which fuel such surrogate model development, are mushrooming. Automated data and knowledge capture from the literature (to populate data repositories) using natural language processing approaches is being explored. The design of materials that meet target property requirements and of synthesis steps to create target materials appear to be within reach, either by closed-loop active-learning strategies or by inverting the prediction pipeline using advanced generative algorithms. AI and ML concepts are also transforming the computational and physical laboratory infrastructural landscapes used to create materials data in the first place. Surrogate models that can outstrip physics-based simulations (on which they are trained) by several orders of magnitude in speed while preserving accuracy are being actively developed. Automation, autonomy and guided high-throughput techniques are imparting enormous efficiencies and eliminating redundancies in materials synthesis and characterization. The integration of the various parts of the burgeoning ML landscape may lead to materials-savvy digital assistants and to a human-machine partnership that could enable dramatic efficiencies, accelerated discoveries and increased productivity. Here, we review these emergent materials intelligence ecosystems and discuss the imminent challenges and opportunities. The materials research landscape is being transformed by the infusion of approaches based on machine learning.

To do this, this paper uses the attractor concept from complexity thinking to explore both the history and possible futures of Indigenous Maori social innovation as shaped by Te Tiriti o Waitangi/Treaty of Waitangi. Design/methodology/approach This paper frames Te Tiriti as a structural attractor for social innovation in Aotearoa-New Zealand and explores the dynamics at play in the social and economic activities related to Te Tiriti and the ongoing settlement process in Aotearoa-New Zealand. This paper outlines this as an illustrative case study detailing the relevant contextual spaces and dynamics that interact and the emergence of social innovation. Findings This paper suggests that the convergent, divergent and unifying dynamics present in a structural attractor provide a useful framework for building ongoing engagement between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people whereby Indigenous worldviews are given space to be articulated and valued.

These communities are defined as groups of people who have a common interest in solving local social problems and, consequently, contributing to the development of Smart Territories.

To this end, the path is to create or maintain Social Entrepreneurship initiatives, with the human being at the centre of this intervention. This paper will also discuss the importance of communication networks between communities and among social entrepreneurs belonging to these communities, using, for this purpose, the Actor-Network Theory (ANT), through which the social production of knowledge, the human and non-human actors in the process and its application in the development of Smart Territories will be analysed.

However, the underlying mechanisms of technological learning and the unique catch-up context in large emerging economies are much less explored. To explain the technological learning processes of latecomers that face the technology gap and strive to build differentiated competitive advantage, this study builds on the absorptive capacity perspective and deconstructs technological learning processes into two mechanisms: technology decomposition and technology recombination. The former entails decomposing advanced technologies into pieces, parts, or modules, while the latter entails the process of capturing market opportunities through recombining knowledge from diverse sources into commercial products through localized innovations and adaptations. Then, we propose a unique 'ladder-like' catch-up context (i.e., technology ladder and market ladder) and investigate how the technological learning process and the unique catch-up context jointly affect industrial catch-up performance in China. Using seven-year panel data from Chinese manufacturing industries, the results indicate that only technology recombination has a significantly positive relationship with industrial catch-up performance. In addition, the market ladder strengthens the positive impact of technology recombination on industrial catch-up, while the technology ladder weakens the positive impact of technology decomposition on catch-up.",2022,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/mor.2021.7,C10,3,2020,Journal,0,0,0,0.082645941,0.10399673,0.212213882,0,0.111219166,0,0,0.048212532,0,0,0,0,0.040110205,0,0.026132417,0.042819686,0.05240573,0,0.043175504,0.011120895,0.135054071,0.020284988,0.092619254,0.046441773,0,0,0,0.082871184,0,0,0,0.078094194,0,0,0.036002929,0.046707752,0,0,0.024515555,0,0,0,0.072882451,0.109468219,0.076142873,0,0,0.034847807,0.044021848,0.131698589,0.037121708,0.084471026,0,0,0.090325979,0,0.140123255,0.03010866,0.033331703,0.089031934,0.731442195,0,0,0,0,0.155313428,0.049209275,0,0.051741007,0,0,0,0,0,0.195758976,0.084239955,0.030266103,0.024647144,0.327891164,0.023482325,0.026973338,0.056157742,0.028057344,0.201554996,0,0,0,0.013831629,0,0,0,0,0.040002252,0.042701975,0.096705985,0,0,,,,1,1,1,1,,,,,2

Therefore, this study aims to test the association of marketing and financial metrics use and the metric-based orientations of training and compensation, with two key marketing routines - exploitation, i.e. the perfecting of existing activities while allowing for incremental adaptations and exploration or experimentation accompanied by radical adaptation. Design/methodology/approach The study gathers data from 205 managers and uses partial least squares structural equation modeling to test the hypothesized relationships. Findings Marketing metrics encourage both forms of marketing adaptation. Financial metrics use discourages exploration. Market orientation and long-term orientation strengthen (weaken) the positive (negative) relationship between marketing (financial) metrics use and marketing exploration. Metric-based training is more positively associated with both adaptive capabilities than a metric-based compensation orientation, albeit weakly. Research limitations/implications The study's central proposition - that different metrics or metric orientations are associated with distinct types of knowledge, interpretations, mindsets, motivations and cultural contexts - provides a deeper theoretical understanding of the pathways by which a metric emphasis affects marketing adaptation. Practical implications Marketing managers should emphasize marketing metrics and training more than compensation, to promote marketing exploitation/exploration, while exercising caution in overstressing financial metrics given their negative association with exploration. This latter negative relationship can be weakened (as can the positive one between marketing metrics and exploration be strengthened) with increased market orientation and long-term orientation.

However, none have been highly satisfying in lessening the impact of disasters. The signifcant factor for the limited success of modern scientifc society is that it views the world from a temporal perspective where humans are believed to be an active agent in modifying every natural possibility into opportunity. The very composite environmental system is simplified whilst extracting resources, resulting in resource depletion and environmental degradation, consequently opening the door for disaster. Technocratic science must recognise the need for a relational or holistic approach rather than believing in reductionist approaches alone whilst dealing with natural calamities. In this context, the knowledge of traditional societies is important to fill up the existing gaps created by the modern society. Traditional knowledge has different sets of ingredients to foster the development of the relational or holistic approach as it involves, interacts and interconnects humans, non-humans (animals and plants) and nature together, setting a perfect balance for sustainable development and DRR. It has vast undocumented observational data of changing natural phenomena, and in todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s scenario of climate change and uncertainty, it can create a path for reliable adaptation measures from climate-induced disasters. Thus, a holistic approach is needed for comprehensive DRR measures where both scientific and traditional knowledge systems can work together. The main purpose of this article was to explore the effective ingredients of traditional knowledge in DRR and how this age-old wisdom can be offered a hand to its integration into and collaboration with scientific research and management for DRR. To fulfil the objectives, a theoretical desk study approach was followed by identifying relevant studies, highlighting traditional knowledge in DRR from empirical and grey literatures, archive materials, biblical stories and so on. This research highlights some of the good practices of traditional knowledge in DRR and the possible path of collaboration of two knowledge systems in DRR. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2019. The Authors.

Previous research has indicated a need for measurement instruments with proven ecological validity in China, because the learning capability of organizations is influenced by the organization's external environment. Design/methodology/approach - The authors followed a consequent inductive procedure from item sampling through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and nomological validation. The initial part sampled relevant descriptors from a diverse sample of 159 employees from heterogeneous backgrounds in China. After sorting by an expert panel, EFA of data from a sample of 161 executive students yielded a three-dimensional construct comprising knowledge acquisition, knowledge sharing and knowledge utilization. These three constructs were again tested in CFA using a sample of 357 employees from five companies. Findings - The findings across the three samples resulted in a three-dimensional measurement scale that is called as the organizational learning capability questionnaire (OLCQ). The OLCQ displayed high internal consistency, reliability and nomological validity. Research limitations/implications - This focus of this study has only been to establish a measurement instrument that allows indigenous research on organizational learning in China. The approach was statistically driven grounded approach, not a theoretical assumption of learning mechanisms special to the Chinese culture. Further research is needed to estimate how this approach yields results that are different from other cultures or the extent to which our findings can be explained by features of the Chinese culture or business environment. Practical implications - This study offers a practical measurement instrument to assess practical and scientific problems of organizational learning in China. Social implications - The work here emphasizes the necessity of a knowledge sharing community for organizational learning to appear. It addresses a call for more indigenous Chinese management research. Originality/value - The authors provide a measurement instrument for OLC with proven ecological validity and with promising consequences for research and practice in China. The instrument is empirically grounded in the practices and behaviors of Chinese managers, avoiding biases that stem from previously identified shortcomings in cross-cultural management research. To the knowledge, it is the first of its kind and a contribution to a call for indigenous management theories with contextual validity.",2021,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/NBRI-04-2020-0015,C2,4,2022,Journal,0,0,0.122858949,0,0.078549391,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.080005263,0.090886478,0.236049062,0.059213941,0.097025943,0,0,0,0.012599524,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.101974655,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.082572867,0,0,0,0,0,0.498749725,0,0,0.095702254,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.100869578,0.710309491,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.065261828,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.053209048,0.061119401,0.084832598,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.279374081,0,0.096759219,0,0,0,,,1,,,,,,1,,,4

Organisations need therefore a capacity for intended memory loss, which has been labelled as unlearning. Although a number of scholars have examined unlearning, research is still only beginning to understand unlearning especially in the area of technology identification and evaluation. The goal of this study is therefore to examine unlearning on an organisational and individual level in this context. Unlearning on an organisational level comprises team composition strategies and directives as well as the implementation of unlearning mechanisms. On an individual level, unlearning highlights cognitive prototypes which exert an influence on the perception of technologies and their evaluation. A qualitative approach has been chosen to examine those aspects, in which technological gatekeepers serve as sample subjects. Technological gatekeepers take a crucial role in the technology identification and evaluation as decision makers and due to their influence on organisational structures and processes. The results of this study suggest that unlearning plays currently only a minor role on an organisational and individual level, which is mainly caused by existing rigidities and in the missing understanding of the necessity to unlearn.",2016,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S1363919616500171,C17,9,2020,Journal,0,0,0,0,0.044098007,0,0,0,0.062372372,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.007073433,0,0.02580449,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.070515586,0,0,0.04967173,0.74238713,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.069627146,0.032287063,0.067370445,0,0,0,0.055844499,0,0.053727707,0.053143049,0,0,0,0,0.038301163,0.042401189,0,0.531694901,0,0.0321157,0,0,0,0.187797045,0.120456087,0.039491776,0,0,0,0,0,0.149414749,0,0,0,0.059587094,0,0,0.023812715,0.178458438,0,0,0,0,0.070380743,0,0.075412595,0,0,0.050886781,0.054321092,0,0.052998218,0,,,,,1,1,1,,,1,1,4

From the perspective of the relation attributes between knowledge elements, this paper divides knowledge cross-border searching into two types: domain knowledge searching and architectural knowledge coupling searching. Then, we construct a system dynamics model and use Vensim PLE software to carry out simulation analysis to explore the differential mechanisms of knowledge cross-border searching influence firms' dual innovation in the context of digital transformation. The analysis results show that domain knowledge searching positively affects firms' iterative innovation, while there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between architectural knowledge searching and firms' disruptive innovation, indicating that different types of knowledge cross-border searching have differential effects on firms' dual innovation. The simulation results also address that digital resources can promote enterprises' dual innovation in the process of knowledge cross-border searching. The research results reveal that the internal laws of knowledge cross-border searching affect enterprises' dual innovation in the context of digital transformation and provide a theoretical reference for enterprises to effectively use digital technology to adopt knowledge searching activities.

Traditionally, AI techniques often require centralized data collection and training in a single entity, e.g., an MEC server, which is now becoming a weak point due to data privacy concerns and high overhead of raw data communications. In this context, federated learning (FL) has been proposed to provide collaborative data training solutions, by coordinating multiple mobile devices to train a shared AI model without directly exposing their underlying data, which enjoys considerable privacy enhancement. To improve the security and scalability of FL implementation, blockchain as a ledger technology is attractive for realizing decentralized FL training without the need for any central server. Particularly, the integration of FL and blockchain leads to a new paradigm, called FLchain, which potentially transforms intelligent MEC networks into decentralized, secure, and privacy-enhancing systems. This article presents an overview of the fundamental concepts and explores the opportunities of FLchain in MEC networks. We identify several main issues in FLchain design, including communication cost, resource allocation, incentive mechanism, security and privacy protection. The key solutions and the lessons learned along with the outlooks are also discussed. Then, we investigate the applications of FLchain in popular MEC domains, such as edge data sharing, edge content caching and edge crowdsensing.

Chinese trends in R&D and patenting are compared to those of the countries of the 'triad' (the European Union, Japan and the US), as well as to those of other large emerging economies (Brazil, India, Mexico and South Africa). The analysis demonstrates how both in innovation inputs and outputs China reflects an innovation reality closer to that of the most developed areas of the world than to that of other emerging countries. However, the rapid ascent of Chinese innovation has generated a distinct set of territorial dynamics, with innovation much more geographically concentrated than elsewhere in the world and more reliant on agglomeration forces than on more traditional 'innovative' drivers.

This study provides a theoretical framework and empirical validation for how an NPD team manages knowledge resources and strategic orientation to enhance its knowledge management capabilities, which, in turn, lead to business-to-busienss (B-to-B) new product advantages. Methodology/approach: A total of 100 sets of data was collected from B-to-B firms in U.S. high-tech industries. In order to validate the proposed hypotheses, we estimated the main effects using path analysis in AMOS, and tested for interaction effects using interaction term regressions. Findings: Our findings show that the two dimensions of NPD knowledge management capabilitiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âacquisition and applicationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âare important but differential drivers of product quality superiority and product differentiation. In testing whether NPD management capabilities matter for two product advantage constructs, we confirmed that product quality superiority can be enhanced by both NPD knowledge acquisition and application capabilities, whereas product differentiation can be increased strongly by NPD knowledge acquisition capabilities. Research implications: Our research confirms the importance of strategic orientation as a driver of NPD knowledge management capabilities, which enhances understanding of how strategic factors operate under a resource-based view. Our results further provide direct empirical support for the knowledge-based view of firms, in that an NPD teamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s abilities to manage and deploy knowledge-based resources by acquiring and applying NPD knowledge lead to competitive advantages, for outcomes of quality superiority and differentiation. Practical implications: Our findings have relevance for managers in three ways. First, NPD knowledge acquisition and application capabilities have differential impacts on product quality superiority and differentiation. Second, in exploring NPD resource factors as antecedents, managers should manage levels of NPD market intelligence, resource tacitness, and NPD resource deployment differentially to directly improve NPD teamsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ acquisition and application capabilities. Third, managers should not underestimate the importance of market and technological orientations in enhancing NPD knowledge management capabilities. Market orientation drives both NPD knowledge acquisition and application capabilities; technological orientation drives NPD knowledge application capabilities. Originality/value/contribution of the paper: An NPD teamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s knowledge management capabilities generally, but differentially, mediate the relationships of knowledge resources and strategic orientation factors with new product competitive advantage. However, simply enhancing NPD knowledge management capabilities is not a panacea for developing product competitive advantage in B-to-B settings, because of their differential effects.

It is discussed how certain concepts of communication studies may benefit both interpersonal interactions and the design process itself. Autoethnographic research is used to reflect on the group dynamics of 5 product design students during a practical training period in Oslo Municipality. The different roles and behavioural patterns of the group members are analysed against the background of cybernetic theory and Batesons communication theory, as well as Schons theory of reflective practice. The ways in which the group dynamics could be altered to facilitate more holistic approaches are suggested based on the findings obtained. By letting go of ones roles and habits, accepting contradictions and opening up for questioning despite the uncertainty and threats it may pose for the comfort of stability, conditions can be created for more inclusive, engaging design processes, knowledge-sharing and, most importantly, learning through reflection. It is argued that communication literacy is one of the skills that form the basis for comprehensive and innovative design methodologies. Understanding communication phenomenon and the ways it can be used to facilitate learning, i.e. change, have the potential to offer a new perspective on the wicked problems in design fields. Thus, it is suggested that they be included in the corresponding curricula.

Green intellectual capital (IC) has been considered to be a vitally important mechanism for companies to move towards green production. By adopting the Intellectual capital-based view (ICV) as the underpinning theory, this study aims to investigate the green intellectual capital and social innovation tie-up. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative research approach was adopted in this study. The mail survey was used to collect data from managers of 509 manufacturing units operating in J&K, India. The study model was tested using structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings: Based on the SEM results, the key factors that significantly influence social innovation were green human capital and green structural capital. The results also posited that green relational capital was not significantly related to social innovation. Originality/value: As revealed by the existing literature, no similar work has been done yet. Therefore, this study's originality lies in its exploration of green intellectual capital (IC) and social innovation interplay in an environmentally sensitive sector, manufacturing. Besides, this study offers insights to academics and practitioners in the manufacturing sector, especially in emerging economies.

While the notion of digital innovation management has received increasing interest, prior IS research has offered limited insights into the effectiveness of specific organizing structures and mechanisms, such as the allocation of decision rights or the coordination between IS and business units. In this study, we combine an IT governance perspective with configurational theory to explore digital innovation governance configurations that achieve high performance. We employ fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), a method that accommodates mutual causality, discontinuity and equifinality, to analyze survey data from a sample of U.S. IT managers. The analysis reveals six different configurations that produce high digital innovation performance. We use these results to derive theoretical insights as configurational propositions for further research, and discuss their practical implications.

Besides, researches on the relationship of paradoxical leadership with team innovation and individual innovation are still in the exploratory stage. OBJECTIVE: Integrating paradoxical leadership theory, role system theory and role engagement theory, we developed a multilevel, dual process model to explore the mechanisms through which paradoxical leadership simultaneously affect individual innovation and team innovation. METHODS: Based on the multiphase, multisource data collected from 367 employees of 80 teams in Fujian and Jiangsu province in China, Structural equation model (SEM) and Hierarchical Linear Model (HLM) were applied to analyze the survey data. RESULTS: Our empirical results revealed that, (1) At the individual level, role engagement positively contributes to individual innovation. (2) At the team level, paradoxical leadership exerted positive influence on team innovation, and team coordination mediates the relationship between paradoxical leadership and team innovation. (3) At the cross level, paradoxical leadership positively contributed to individual innovation, and the variables role engagement and team coordination play a cross-level mediation role in the relationship of paradoxical leadership and individual innovation. Furthermore, team coordination moderates the relationship between role engagement and individual innovation. CONCLUSIONS: By combining paradoxical leadership theory, role system theory and role engagement theory, we proposed a multilevel theoretical framework, taking a meaningful step for explaining the relationship and the influence mechanism between paradoxical leadership and team innovation and individual innovation. Our finding inspires leaders at all levels of the organization to leverage paradoxical leadership to engage the contradictions and competing demands pervade in the workplace and organizations effectively, and gain comfort from discomfort, and further achieve good innovation performance. We hope our research can offer a basis for management research and practice in this complex set. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2020-IOS Press and the authors.

As a result, targeted mechanisms to acquire, translate, and disseminate knowledge into new policies are critical for adaptive environmental governance. The scholarship on learning in environmental governance has exploded in the past two decades leading to new empirical and theoretical insights. However, lacking from this literature is an examination of how these insights can inform practice. Here we explore evidence from the scholarship studying learning in environmental governance that can inform practitioners who engage in and manage environmental planning and decision-making processes. Three key factors are drawn from the scholarship that may foster learning: face-to-face dialog that is open and ongoing; cross-scale linkages; and investments in institutional rules, norms, and shared strategies for intentional learning.

In order to gain a clearer insight into to the influence of a firm's culture on organizational unlearning and its innovation capabilities, a researchmodel was developed that employs the Competing Values Framework (Cameron and Quinn, 1999). In this model, the influence of a firm's cultural typology on unlearning and innovation is conceptualized and hypotheses are developed.

However, much of the previous work has either focused on investigating human perception of redirected walking illusions or developing novel redirection techniques. In this paper, we take a broader look at the problem and formalize the concept of a complete redirected walking system. This work establishes the theoretical foundations for combining multiple redirection strategies into a unified framework known as adaptive redirection. This meta-strategy adapts based on the context, switching between a suite of strategies with a priori knowledge of their performance under the various circumstances. This paper also introduces a novel static planning strategy that optimizes gain parameters for a predetermined virtual path, known as the Combinatorially Optimized Pre-Planned Exploration Redirector (COPPER). We conducted a simulation-based experiment that demonstrates how adaptation rules can be determined empirically using machine learning, which involves partitioning the spectrum of contexts into regions according to the redirection strategy that performs best. Adaptive redirection provides a foundation for making redirected walking work in practice and can be extended to improve performance in the future as new techniques are integrated into the framework.",2022,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2022.3150500,C11,1,2009,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.110981285,0,0,0,0,0.047229126,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.234667591,0,0,0,0,0.1983623,0.223929252,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.560866756,0.559308338,0,0.179369231,0.177417357,0,0,0,0,0.127867918,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.214634701,0,0,0,0,0.166273046,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.209601868,0,0,0,0.12588197,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,,1,,,,1,,,,,2

The purpose of this paper is to design and evaluate a curriculum to help engineering design students to learn from failure. Design/methodology/approach: A new curriculum design provided a case study for evaluating the effects of incorporating learning from failure within a civil engineering course. An analysis of the changes in course output was undertaken in relation to graduate destination data covering 2006 to 2016 and student satisfaction from 2012 to 2017 and a number of challenges and solutions for curriculum designers were identified. Findings: The design and delivery of an innovative curriculum, within typical constraints, can provide opportunities for students to develop resilience to failure as an integral part of their learning in order to think creatively and develop novel engineering solutions. The key issues identified were: the selection of appropriate teaching methods, creating an environment for exploratory learning, group and team assessments with competitive elements where practicable and providing students with many different pedagogical approaches to produce a quality learning experience. Originality/value: This case study demonstrates how to design and implement an innovative curriculum that can produce positive benefits of learning from failure. This model can be applied to other disciplines such as building surveying and construction management. This approach underpins the development of skills necessary in the educational experience to develop as a professional building pathologist.

Although they are often regarded as laggards in the general progress towards adopting digital technologies, the pressure to cut costs and to review existing business models have prompted the industry forerunners within the process industries to reassess their business operations. One way to tackle this issue is to source information from the emerging startup landscape. To shed light on the importance of digitalization within the process industries, this paper provides a novel perspective using startup information. Therefore, it examines the interaction dynamics between the process industries and other industries. By centering on emerging interactions with information technology (IT)-related industries, this study further focuses on identifying the different digitalization efforts of the process industries and explores their varying degree of digital affinity. Our results indicate that not all process industries can be regarded as laggards in terms of incorporating digital capabilities.

The study analyzes improvisation from the perspective of paradox theory and identifies six paradoxical tensions driven by these contexts: deployment, development, temporal, procedural, structural, and behavioral tensions. We propose a dynamic equilibrium model of team improvised adaptation that leads to team plasticity.

Design/methodology/approach: This is a qualitative interpretative study through the theoretical lens of social innovation. The organizational phenomenon studied was the business strategy for sustainable regional development of a Brazilian financial institution. Secondary data were collected from financial institutionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s documents. The data analysis followed a categorization technique. Findings: This research presents five intersectional elements that act as agglutinating factors between the structural elements common to these organizations: the processes (inter-organizational and intra-organizational), the forms of materialization of social innovation (products, experiences and replicable forms) and the impacts (in society and organization). Practical implications: The paper contributes to the debate about social innovation as to its definition, showing that it is both a phenomenon and a theory, which is still little explored. In particular, in emerging countries, such as Brazil, which publishes little about social innovation in international literature, going beyond European countries. Second, an empirical deeper understanding of the for-profit ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œorganizationsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â modus operandi adopts and integrates social innovation in their strategies and operations. Third, given the multidimensional and complex nature of the social systems involved in innovation actions, it discusses a strategy that acts as an agglutinating factor. Finally, with reflections so that managers can discuss and start up a social innovation project. Originality/value: Most research is based on nonempirical evidence. Among the few empirical works, the focus is on the performance of nonprofit organizations in the promotion, development and implementation of projects involving social technology. The literature does not adequately understand how for-profit organizations adopt and integrate social innovation into their strategies and operations. Furthermore, it is observed that research analyzes data from European countries, with few approaches eying countries in development.

This study adds green innovation as mediator in the relationship between CSR and competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach: A model with three second-order constructs is developed and tested, in a sample of 325 managers from manufacturing companies in Ecuador, using quantitative and cross-section methods. Findings: After obtaining adjusted and validated measurement models, a structural equation model was conducted, where the main hypotheses were confirmed, providing empirical evidence that CSR and green innovation significantly influence manufacturing competitiveness in a developing economy. Research limitations/implications: This study considers only manufacturing companies in Ecuador, focusing on CSR practices in a single territorial case study. It arguably contributes to reinforce the business case for CSR, with new evidence on the causal relationships between CSR, green innovation and competitiveness, in the context of emerging market manufacturing industries. Although the literature often points at a positive relationship between CSR and firm-level competitiveness, supporting empirical evidence remains scarce. This model, introducing green innovation as mediator in the relationship between CSR and competitiveness in developing markets, accounts for a novel theoretical approach. Practical implications: The findings are consistent with previous research, reporting the positive influence of CSR activities on organizational competitiveness, reducing risks and cost structures, as well as improving the relationship with employees, enhancing talent attraction, retention and productivity. Incorporating formal CSR tools to the model allowed us to highlight the relevance of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“greenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ certifications as a means to provide a competitive edge, along with increased bargaining power in the supply chain, resulting in competitiveness gains. The findings on the role of green innovation suggest a transition from cost-savings to a more strategic leverage on responsible innovation as a source of competitive advantage. Social implications: Additionally, this research contributes to shed light on the impact of green processes and product innovations on social and environmental performance, providing evidence of a more efficient use of energy and natural resources, increasing productivity and by extension, profitability. CSR shapes an innovation culture that, through the use of social, environmental and sustainability controllers, can create new business models, products, services or processes that boost both firm-level and supply chain productivity, benefits that eventually spill over to the host community. Originality/value: This study aims at bridging the research gap on the interplay of CSR, green innovation and competitiveness in manufacturing in an emerging market context.

Compared with common inventors, they often have different ways of thinking, knowledge structure, practical experience, and innovation capability. These advantages and capabilities are deemed to be closely related to their embedded collaboration networks. Within the static analysis framework, degree centrality and tie strength are the two most important and basic metrics. However, innovation collaboration is often accomplished in a dynamic environment. In this case, then, a question raised is how do these two network characteristics affect key inventors' creativity. At the same time, most of the previous studies are based on a fixed data window and use the characteristics of innovative collaboration networks within windows to examine individual outcomes. But this artificial segmentation does not take into account the career stage characteristics of key inventors. Since each key inventor always has a long research history that is stage-featured, we cannot neglect this to explore corresponding mechanisms by roughly following the traditional method. Therefore, if research careers are used as the basis for classification, we do believe that it's beneficial to investigate the creativity of key inventors by using the different collaborative and contextual factors across periods. This paper primarily brings in the principle of the Cook curve and uses the peak of creativity to divide their research careers to solve these problems. Specifically, we separately count the granted patents over the years based on key inventors' entire research career and take the year with the largest number of authorized patents as a demarcation point. It's important to note that a research career is a period between the application years of their first and last applied patent. After that, we define the period before the cut-off point, including the peak year, as the rising period, and take the later stage as the recession one. Correspondingly, we divide the patent data that is collected from 34 high-tech listed companies in the domestic electronic information and motor vehicle industries into two different time windows following the two-stage research career. In doing so, we build innovative collaboration networks of key inventors and calculate the relevant variables of each observation point. Finally, by integrating the variables in each research period into different samples, we use the logit model and the two-sample t-test to verify two sets of hypotheses and try to discuss how the difference in tie strength and network centrality influence the creativity of key inventors. The results show that in the rising period, the degree centrality of key inventors is positively correlated to their creativity. To be more specific, it is quite critical for inventors who want to be key inventors to reduce inefficient and ineffective connections selectively. Because it is detrimental for rising-stage key inventors to rely solely on the accumulation of ties, or spend too much time and energy on maintaining past relationships. On the other hand, in the recession period, the greater the difference in tie strength between key inventors and their contact, the slighter their creativity decrease. Precisely speaking, in the recession period, key inventors have generally formed an inherent knowledge structure with mature knowledge and capabilities in the research activities. Since the research areas between key inventors and others are getting closer and closer, the knowledge they acquired is becoming more and more similar. Therefore, it becomes a hindrance to their breakthrough, although it has created inventors' professional level and ability in this field. In summary, based on key inventors' initial embedding characteristics and growth tracks, we analyze the relationship between the dynamic changes of network structure and individual creativity with a complete research career perspective. The results not only theoretically enrich the studies on the influence factors of key inventors' rising and recession process but also provide some new insight into the acceleration of key inventors' growth and postponing their recession stage. Besides, we explore the influence factors of creativity from the difference in tie strength in inventors' ego network, which is different from the previous studies. It reminds researchers to recognize the necessity and importance of relationship diversity in future studies. What's more, this paper further promotes the research on the individual characteristics and behavioral outcomes of key inventors. It may help managers to arrange inventors' activities and improve the enterprise's innovation capability. In practice, our research outcomes also offer several management implications. First of all, companies should use differentiated management styles for key inventors' growth characteristics and needs in different stages. Second, we must fully consider the position of the strategic execution point in the key inventors' career stage. Third, innovation managers should fully combine the advantages of key inventors in the rising period in the course of new product development and technological innovation. Fourth, managers can properly adjust key inventors in their recession stage by promotion or rotation. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2020.

Spanish enterprises provide an excellent example of this trend considering that the statistics show that the level of innovation has improved but it is still a far cry from USA and Europe's results. The size of enterprises, mainly SMEs (95%) is one of the possible causes. However, it seems contradictory if the power of innovation is so widespread there is not a relationship in economic activities of different companies. It involves indentifying what the facilitators and barriers are that explain why enterprises don't undertake some innovation projects. Among the barriers to be considered: financial, management style, skills and knowledge or manpower. In relation to the facilitators in this study, corporate culture, communication processes and others aspects are analyzed. In this way, this paper focuses on detecting companies' framework and perception of innovation and accordingly proposing solutions to improve the level of innovation. The theoretical framework has been widely proven to show that innovation is a key factor in competitiveness in companies and in countries. The positive effects are not only economic. The influence extends to social and cultural environments. Thus, public policies are really important to enhance innovation. Large, medium and small businesses achieve better results thanks to innovation but SMEs have always been shown to achieve a lesser advantage. A lot of literature has tried to analyze the causes. Adaptive capacity is an advantage in SMEs but they have resistance to change related to their size, especially in relation to resources that are available. The main debate revolves around how barriers influence the level of innovation but unusual that researchers focus on facilitators. The combined analysis of the factors which motivate and discourage innovation is the most relevant contribution to this field. This study stands out, not only because of its scope, but also because of the direction of its analysis of innovation. Through this analysis the paper attempts to identify different groups of potential moderators. Therefore, this paper analyses the phenomenon from the perspective of perception, company characteristics, attitudes and the management model in SMEs. Data was collected from a total of 114 enterprises from southern Spain. A survey has been chosen as the quantitative research method. After the data is processed using Exploratory Factorial Analyses (AFE), as statistical techniques are more reliable for feeling the weight of each element, some mechanisms are proposed to give a guarantee of success. Additionally, this statistical method is recommended to describe the relationship between a large number of measured traits and a small number of unobserved factors. Factorial solution discovers the nature of the constructs (barriers and facilitators) influencing innovation in SMEs. Although the results are similar to those shown in the literature review some interesting influences are detected. The examination of the pattern of correlations between the observed measures in the sample highlight how the items are structured in respect to those of which are likely influenced by the same factors. According to the analysis the following barriers and facilitators are presented. Barriers: 1) related to innovation consequences, 2) barriers resulting from opportunity/cost of innovation, 3) perception of innovation, 4) barriers reflected in innovative capacity, 5) economic and cultural barriers, 6) lack of internal and external information and 7) knowledge barriers. On the other hand, the following facilitators are shown: 1) support of innovation (investment, qualified team, strategic innovation plan, culture...), 2) facilitator for innovation development (company's motivation and implication and person with competence and capabilities to lead innovation project, 3) internal organization, 4) Skills and knowledge facilitators, 5)fiscal facilitators and 6) communication facilitators both within and outside the company. Results are consistent with previous literature but the main contribution is a coherent structure for grouping all conditioning factors involved in innovation processes. It is only a starting point from which to evaluate which elements should be reinforced in innovation if companies want to achieve effective results. However, the sample size is the most important limitation in factorial analysis because communalities between variables are low and, in consequence, some factors are composed by a single variable. Anyway, this paper is a first approach to gain better perceptions and behaviours about innovation in SMEs. In the future, it would be interesting to extend the sample including SMEs from different geographical locations as well as to identify economic profiles regarding innovation. Additionally over time, barriers and facilitators should be considered as well as indentifying the effects on perception of innovation in economic crises. The findings in this research reveal that innovation is not affected by dimension or sector of activity, innovation level depends on certainty and abilities to assimilate this element as a method of management and development. In summary, the paper is supported by exhaustive analyses of the elements more relevant to the level of innovation in enterprises, especially SME's. Economic aspects are the most influential facilitators and barriers. Another interesting question is the reliance on public support to innovate in SMEs and the lack of financial ability to implement it. On the other hand, enterprises consider that their teams are qualified enough to develop innovation projects but their structures are insufficient, so they prioritize productivity and, in consequence, innovation is discouraged. Related to that, management teams accept their limitations in this strategic area and this becomes a cultural problem that influences negatively too. All the above is further aggravated by false beliefs about protection of innovation and non-collaborative behaviors. Concluding with the main findings, the concept of innovation is most probably a greater problem because many companies associate innovation with high technology and R&D only. However, innovation provides more options to improve and find competitive advantages. Finally, there are several practical implications for adopting strategic decisions in enterprises; moreover some recommendations are exposed for agents with competences in socioeconomic development. In this way, the proposal to minimize barriers and ideas to potentiate facilitators is made as well as some institutional actions which are detailed in this section. This package of proposals is useful for government decision-making bodies and their strategists to make plans and programmes that are aimed at supporting and encouraging innovation as the driving-force of the economy.",2017,Journal,,C8,5,1995,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.136091561,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.086408353,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.113655471,0,0,0,0.101404004,0.135658229,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.119992274,0,0.502900616,0,0,0,0.06211401,0,0,0,0.646399603,0.214867841,0,0.103361626,0,0,0.073683964,0,0.114306393,0.073683964,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.103078879,0,0,0,0,0,0.091622035,0.068663843,0,0,0,0.315241245,0,0,0.07253956,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.185098332,1,,,,,,,,,,,6

Informed by the evolutionary perspective and path-dependence theory, the authors explore how a low-tech Norwegian firm in the oil and gas industry has lost its foothold as an innovator. They also employ the concept of organizational architecture as an analytical tool to investigate the agency for breaking organizational paths. Through participant observation and semi-structured interviews, their study revealed that the innovation activity of the case firm is in a state of lock-in following a path-dependence development. Product development in the firm is linked to incremental changes to existing products based on the feedback from the customer, and the process is characterized by knowledge exploitation rather than knowledge exploration.

In this paper; we study the less-explored aspect of organisational response focusing on discontinuous innovation. The Indian auto sector requires a tool for long-term market dominance; particularly owing to the rapid change in the business environment. This can be achieved through a special kind of discontinuous innovation known as disruptive innovation (DI). We further affirm how developing DI is facilitated by the firm's dynamic capability ( DC); to substantiate our claims; we develop and utilise a survey instrument to test a hypothesised model with responses from various firms affiliated with the Indian auto component industry. Our findings confirm the positive roles of DC and research and development (R&D) expenditure as antecedents to DI. We further conduct exploratory analysis to study factors such as R&D and environmental turbulence as moderators of the DC-DI relationship.

This paper aims to explore the evolving dialectic tensions evident within an inter-organisational relationship and the governance consideration to optimise the knowledge process. Design/methodology/approach A longitudinal case of a university-industry knowledge network is selected for study. The single case analysis aligns with the dialectical epistemology, which dismisses the expectation of homogeny or constancy across network cases. Findings The research highlights the circular condition between dialectic tensions evident within inter-organisational relations and the governance mechanisms developed to synthesis the network knowledge discovery capability. The research shows that these tensions are a natural part of the network existence and often advantageous to knowledge creation. The research also highlights that governance is required at multiple levels within the network entity to optimise knowledge exchange and discovery. Originality/value The research adds to the limited application of dialectical thinking to inter-organisational networks. It highlights the structural and relational governance mechanisms that interplay to optimise their knowledge process capability. The research also highlights the multiple levels within networks at which tensions can originate, requiring knowledge governance at the micro, meso and macro level to address the complexity of the inter-organisational relationship.

The last decade has seen the proliferation of academic papers, consultancy reports and news articles about the possible effects of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on work-creating visions of both utopian and dystopian workplace futures. AI has the potential to transform the demand for labour, the nature of work and operational infrastructure by solving complex problems with high efficiency and speed. However, despite hundreds of reports and studies, AI remains an enigma, a newly emerging technology, and its rate of adoption and implications for the structure of work are still only beginning to be understood. The current anxiety about labour displacement anticipates the growth and direct use of AI. Yet, in many ways, at present AI is likely being overestimated in terms of impact. Still, an increasing body of research argues the consequences for work will be highly uneven and depend on a range of factors, including place, economic activity, business culture, education levels and gender, among others. We appraise the history and the blurry boundaries around the definitions of AI. We explore the debates around the extent of job augmentation, substitution, destruction and displacement by examining the empirical basis of claims, rather than mere projections. Explorations of corporate reactions to the prospects of AI penetration, and the role of consultancies in prodding firms to embrace the technology, represent another perspective onto our inquiry.

Design/methodology/approach Using empirical survey data collected from 153 traditional manufacturing firms (TMFs) in China, the authors apply partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) combined with mediation analyses to test hypotheses. Findings PNC has a higher impact on exploratory innovation than exploitative innovation through AC. The authors thus provide novel empirical insights into independent variables of firms' ambidextrous innovation and their implementation mechanisms. Research limitations/implications The authors highlight a unique situation of China and contribute to the literature on PNC and AC. The findings demonstrate that AC plays an important role in configuring government-obtained external resources into new products, thus influencing ambidextrous innovation strategic decisions.

We also suggest that the microfoundations of dynamic capabilities can be understood in the context of an organisation's e-learning processes. Using Teece's (2007) sensing, seizing and transforming framework, we present a set of empirically testable propositions that suggest how an organisation's e-learning processes can support the development of dynamic capabilities.

In particular, we examine three research questions that address: (i) the interrelationships among the three dimensions of buyer-supplier social capital (structural, cognitive, relational); (ii) the mechanism through which buyer-supplier social capital can influence supplier performance; and (iii) the contingency factors that influence the key relationships in the main model. We empirically validate the research model using data collected from a North America-based major electronic components distributor (i.e., the buyer) and 166 of its suppliers. The findings of our data analysis indicate that structural and cognitive social capital influence relational social capital. The findings also support that relational social capital allows for the transfer of knowledge from the buyer to the supplier, which in turn leads to greater supplier cost efficiency and innovation. However, the influence of buyer-supplier relational social capital appears to be less important in lengthier buyer-supplier relationships. The analysis also indicates that the benefits derived from a supplier's knowledge enrichment are significantly greater when the supplier possesses greater exploitative capacity. These findings provide important extensions to theory describing buyer-supplier relationships, as well as providing clear prescriptions for suppliers and relationship managers.",2017,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/deci.12220,C10,4,2018,Journal,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.126934065,0,0,0.108381936,0,0.070612502,0,0,0,0.116664694,0.015024906,0,0.054812142,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.242604341,0.146969245,0.048641826,0.252418385,0,0.122675325,0.662435739,0.150744046,0,0,0,0,0.205745946,0.143103714,0,0,0,0.118621085,0,0,0.225765696,0,0.081356723,0,0,0,0,0.120286762,0,0,0,0,0,0.139891,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.066599141,0,0.06345168,0,0.151744046,0,0,0.108968377,0,0,0,0,0.320372606,0,0,0,0,0,0.112575208,0,1,,,,,1,1,,,,,10

This article uses ERGMs (exponential random graph models) to synthesize user attributes from the perspective of social networks, social support and social capital to systematically explore the mechanism of knowledge diffusion in the MOOC learning forum. Design/methodology/approach: First, the literature related to knowledge diffusion is reviewed to define two forms of knowledge diffusion in the MOOC learning forum, i.e., knowledge transferring and knowledge sharing. Second, based on social network theory, research hypotheses related to centrality, reciprocity, and transitivity are proposed; based on social support theory, research hypotheses related to emotional support, information support and sense of belonging support are proposed; and based on social capital theory, research hypotheses related to the number of posts and number of being liked are proposed. Third, machine learning, the most popular course on the Coursera platform, is selected as the research object. The data from March 2016 to December 2019 is obtained, and then, ERGMs are used to simulate the network and test the research hypotheses. Finally, based on the conclusions of this study, corresponding suggestions are proposed from the perspectives of MOOCs platform providers, MOOCs providers and MOOCs learners, to promote the development of MOOCs. Findings: - (1) In the MOOC learning forum, users with high degree centrality contribute more, actively answering questions from other users, and transferring knowledge to others, but knowledge sharing between two users with high degree centrality is unlikely to occur. (2) Significant reciprocity features exist in knowledge transfer in the MOOC learning forum. (3) There is no significant triangular relationship structure in the knowledge sharing network of the MOOC learning forum, which means that multiple dyad sharing partners are more likely to be formed in the MOOC learning forum. (4) Users with emotion tendency tend to transfer knowledge to other users, and knowledge sharing is likely to occur between individuals with emotion tendency. (5) There is no tendency that users with low learning progress receive knowledge transferred by other users. (6) Teaching assistants, as users with higher knowledge potential in the MOOC learning forum, are prone to transfer knowledge to other users. (7) The trend of knowledge sharing between users in the same region is not obvious. (8) Users with more posts and users with more being liked are more likely to receive knowledge transfer by the other users, and thus, they are easier to obtain answers from. A possible explanation for this result could be that users with more posts and users with more being liked have a higher contribution to the MOOC learning forum, and therefore, questions they raised are more likely to attract attention. Theoretical implications: First, current research on the MOOC learning forum focuses on the discussion of user behavior, but there is a lack of research on knowledge diffusion. Therefore, in terms of the research perspective, from the aspect of knowledge diffusion, this article defines two forms of knowledge diffusion: knowledge transfer and knowledge sharing. Then, knowledge transfer network and knowledge sharing network are constructed to explore user posting and replying behaviors, to expand the user behavior research in the MOOC learning forum. Second, current research on the user interaction network in the MOOC learning forum lacks comprehensive research on the network structure and user attributes. The micro logic embedded in the network structure must be systematically analyzed. Therefore, the network structure and user attributes are synthesized to explore the influencing factor of knowledge diffusion, which enriches the research content of the MOOC learning forum. Third, ERGMs are suitable for exploring potential factors of network formation, as well as the impact of multiple features simultaneously on network formation. Currently, ERGMs are widely used to research citation network formation mechanisms and social media network formation mechanisms. However, there is still a lack of research on user interaction networks in the MOOC learning forum while applying ERGMs. Therefore, this article introduces ERGMs into the knowledge diffusion research in the MOOC learning forum to provide effective research methods for modeling and simulating the knowledge diffusion networks. Practical implications: (1) Since high degree centrality users actively answer questions from others, MOOCs platform providers can encourage high degree centrality users to participate in in-depth discussion in forums. Based on the reciprocity of knowledge transfer, MOOCs platform providers can add an information reminder function to remind users to receive information in real time, to promote knowledge transfer between users. Because of the unstable knowledge sharing relationship among learners in the knowledge sharing network of the MOOC learning forum, it is not easy to form a triangular relationship structure. MOOCs platform providers can add a function such as friend circles to enhance the stability of the knowledge sharing relationship and improve the efficiency of the knowledge exchange. (2) Since teaching assistants actively answer questions from other users and play a prominent role in knowledge transfer, course providers can set appropriate incentives for teaching assistants. Because users with emotional tendency are more likely to transfer knowledge, and knowledge sharing is likely to occur between users with emotion tendency, course providers can properly guide users to engage in emotion communication through the participation of teaching assistants, to promote knowledge sharing among users. Because users with low learning progress are usually in a low potential knowledge position, course providers should pay attention to such users to improve their learning interests with help from users in a high potential knowledge position, such as teaching assistants or users who have high learning progress. (3) Because questions raised by users who have more being liked and more posts are more likely to be answered as a result of accumulating social capital, MOOCs learners should actively participate in the course learning forum and have effective interactions with other users. With the increasing number of being liked and the increasing number of posts, users gradually accumulate more social capital to build a foundation for improving their own learning effect. Originality/value: - First, at present, there are few studies on the mechanism of knowledge diffusion in the MOOC learning forum, and knowledge diffusion research is conducive to exploring the influencing factors of users' learning activities in the course learning forum. Therefore, this paper studies the influence mechanism of knowledge diffusion in the MOOC learning forum by integrating the network structure and user attributes to expand the knowledge diffusion research on the MOOC learning forum. Second, although SNA has been widely used in knowledge diffusion research, it is difficult for SNA to explore the potential factors for the formation of knowledge diffusion networks. ERGMs are based on relational data and use network local features as statistical items to explore the overall structural characteristics of the network. Therefore, this paper simulates knowledge diffusion networks of the MOOC learning forum based on ERGMs, systematically exploring the influence of the network structure and node attributes and their interaction with knowledge diffusion, which helps to reveal the socialization process and internal mechanism of the knowledge diffusion network.",2021,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2021.104295,C5,8,2018,Journal,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.327853538,0,0,0.142121631,0,0,0,0.104081707,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.016391171,0,0,0,0,0,0.308964806,0,0,0,0,0.325771568,0,0,0.16033365,0,0.137685816,0,0,0,0,0.121152072,0,0.322265984,0.32269207,0.074818371,0,0,0,0.259536539,0,0,0,0.246295325,0,0,0,0,0.177509523,0,0,0,0.145059844,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.030504584,0,0,0,0,0.41187886,0,0,0,0,0,0.069221553,0,0.05518088,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.141709432,0.08737629,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,1,1,,,,,10

Using frugal innovation as the theoretical lens, we explore this issue in the digital enablement context by using a single longitudinal case study design on a Chinese traditional manufacturing company. This study reveals how the company achieved C2B transformation through frugal innovation and opened the black box of the process of frugal innovation. The result shows that frugal innovation based on an internet strategy updates all the commercial links (e.g. supply of raw materials, design and production, logistics and warehousing, marketing) to form a strong foundation to implement C2B model in three dimensions: frugality, flexibility, and inclusiveness. This study supplements existing knowledge of business model transformation and frugal innovation. The findings offer some recommendations for managers of traditional manufacturing companies in emerging markets to execute business transformations more effectively.

The trajectory of this network's evolution shows that its robustness lies in the joint leadership network among the schools, and the insight and agency that this leadership network exhibited in the intentional exploration and crafting of a social structure and mechanism to support innovative developments in technology and pedagogical innovation, which we refer to as sociotechnical co-evolution. By adopting a sociotechnical system framework to analyse the changes at the landscape, regime and niches levels, we show that in fact landscape factors play a crucial role in shaping the innovation trajectory through its influence on the niches.

The existing literature defines institutional pressure as threats for legitimacy when firms operate within a country or a region; one area that has received little attention is the situation when a firm extends its operations across borders to pursue internationalisation. The study investigates the impact of outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) on green innovation at the firm level. Design/methodology/approach: The zero-inflated negative binomial regression models are estimated to analyse the data collected from 2065 manufacturing enterprises listed in China during 2007-2017 (n = 14 129). Green innovation is measured by the number of green patents, according to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) international Patent Classification (IPC) Green Inventory. Findings/results: The findings show that OFDI is positively associated with green innovation for emerging market enterprises (EMEs). Furthermore, compared with investment in emerging economies, OFDI in developed economies has a stronger positive relationship with corporate green innovation. The positive effect of OFDI on corporate green innovation will be higher for EMEs located in sub-national regions (i.e., province of the home country) with lower levels of institutional development. Practical implications: Emerging market enterprises should overcome organisational inertia and compete in a broader market to enhance their awareness and ability of green innovation. Originality/value: This article contributes to the existing literature by exploring institutional pressure faced by EMEs when they operate overseas (e.g. OFDI) can play a significant role in influencing green innovation, and enriches our understanding of EMEs' inclination towards CSR (e.g. green innovation) in the context of internationalisation.",2020,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.4102/sajbm.v51i1.1883,C1,6,2009,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.148912298,0.095889905,0,0,0.159721885,0,0.192411616,0,0,0,0,0.149738274,0,0,0,0,0.186261133,0.322190034,0,0,0,0,0.141750222,0.155704425,0.125685772,0,0.437694567,0,0,0,0.151831337,0.30281892,0,0,0,0,0,0.323113285,0.161095017,0,0,0.153535552,0,0,0.087074303,0,0,0.17855865,0.16972277,0.065317771,0.035690942,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.17001598,0.161556642,0,0.093031032,0.064562676,0,0.173790776,0,0.170222953,0,0.047705282,0,0,0,0,0,0.147279094,0,0,0,1,,,1,1,1,1,,,,,12

Managing this tension successfully leads to so-called ambidexterity. How to achieve it is still a matter of debate: proponents of structural approaches recommend a separation of exploration and exploitation, while proponents of so-called contextual ambidexterity suggest that contextual factors such as culture and process are equal if not more critical in leading the organization to ambidexterity. Based on the findings of empirical ambidexterity research, many more factors are suggested, though they are rarely researched in an ambidexterity context nor are the interdependencies between the factors and the known ambidexterity strategies described. To guide future research, this paper develops an expanded and system-focused framework for achieving ambidexterity. It is used to review and integrate findings from organizational theory and neighboring disciplines, including project management theories, knowledge management theories, human resource management theories, and open and distributed innovation theories. Managerial implications are discussed and illustrated with a case example. The resulting work provides the basis for explicitly modeling the drivers and inhibitors of exploration and exploitation and their interdependencies.

However, predicting the future is always easier said than done. In this regard, Arthur's theory (The nature of technology: what it is and how it evolves, Free Press, New York, 2009) on the nature of technologies and how science evolves, coupled with Kuhn's theory of scientific revolutions (Kuhn in The structure of scientific revolutions, 1st edn, University of Chicago Press, Chicago, p 3, 1962), may serve as the basis of a shrewd methodological framework for forecasting recombinative innovation. These theories help us to set out quantifiable criteria and decomposable steps to identify research patterns at each stage of a scientific revolution. The first step in the framework is to construct a conceptual model of the target technology domain, which helps to refine a reasonable search strategy. With the model built, the landscape of a field-its communities, its technologies, and their interactions-is fleshed out through community detection and network analysis based on a set of quantifiable criteria. The aim is to map normal patterns of research in the domain under study so as to highlight which technologies might contribute to a structural deepening of technological recombinations. Probability analysis helps to detect and group candidate technologies for possible recombination and further manual analysis by experts. To demonstrate how the framework works in practice, we conducted an empirical study on AI research in China. We explored the development potential of recombinative technologies by zooming in on the top patent assignees in the field and their innovations. In conjunction with expert analysis, the results reveal the cooperative and competitive relationships among these technology holders and opportunities for future innovation through technological recombinations.",2019,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-019-03218-5,C11,1,2022,Journal,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.166660156,0,0.080843247,0.283186298,0,0.167159231,0,0,0.116433026,0.396805932,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.296072836,0,0.237448731,0,0,0,0.080843247,0,0,0,0,0,0.083697026,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.137761528,0,0.099287241,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.083252807,0,0,0,0.324548033,0,0,0,0,0.094976653,0,0,0.258216325,0.138896131,0,0.243831538,0,0,0.266844325,0.061729165,0.092522758,0,0,0,0,0.136834812,0,0.195490372,0,0,0.131912655,0,0,0.274772172,0,,,,1,1,1,1,,,,,51

It is also examined whetherthis cooperation is a determining factor for business innovation (innovation networks), drawing a distinction between technological and non-technological innovations. Design/methodology/approach - The study has a quantitative approach; it analyzes the case of 312 companies in a cluster of agribusinesses in an emerging economy (Chile). The proposal model and its interrelations are tested with exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling. Findings - The results show that cognitive-organizational proximity is a positive determinant of business cooperation with other organizations, whereas social and institutional proximity are negative determinants. It is also established that business cooperation is a positive determinant of business innovation. It is more relevant in the case of technological innovation unlike non-technological innovations. In addition, it is noted that business cooperation levels are lower in micro-enterprises, a result that differs from developed countries. Practical implications - For business managers, it is best to cooperate with companies that are similar in terms of cognitive and organizational levels for innovation. At the same time, it is necessary develop strategies to reduce the social and institutional barriers to cooperation, especially in the agribusiness sector. Originality/value - The contributions of the study are as follows: an in-depth quantitative examination of the relationships of various non-spatial proximities as determinants of business cooperation; an analysis of whether business cooperation with other organizations is a determining factor for business innovation, distinguishing between technological and non-technological innovation; and testing these relationships in the context of agribusiness in an emerging economy such as Chile's because most of studies are related to high-tech sector and developed economies.",2017,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JBIM-01-2016-0003,C11,2,2020,Journal,0,0,0,0,0.084929525,0,0.123819781,0,0.12012461,0,0,0,0,0,0.08650365,0.098268686,0,0.064023563,0.209813652,0,0,0.105778569,0.013622914,0,0.049697554,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.133255365,0.110257494,0.114432458,0,0,0.600623051,0.136677935,0,0,0.089279806,0.134096772,0.124365027,0.064875266,0,0.085375982,0,0,0.090946966,0,0,0,0.073765228,0,0,0,0.081661579,0.109062658,0,0,0,0,0,0.2536752,0,0,0.050705507,0,0,0,0.11642133,0,0,0,0.074150958,0.120769388,0,0.057530926,0.066083793,0.091723083,0,0.123450781,0.098800405,0,0,0.033887036,0,0.290478247,0,0.151033049,0,0,0.355389733,0,0,,,,1,1,1,1,,,,,51

This study investigates how social integration mechanisms (SIMs; coordination, socialisation, and systems mechanisms) influence an incumbent steel company's absorptive capacity (AC). A micro-level analysis of two radical ideas from unusual sources contributes to AC and radical innovation literatures by exploring relationships between SIMs and four AC capabilities (acquisition, assimilation, transformation, and exploitation).

These learning processes represent a valuable source for entrepreneurship development in incumbent enterprises in the forms of innovative products, services, processes or organizational renewal. Design/methodology/approach - An extreme case study is the project Mimprendo (www.mimprendo.it), an initiative promoted by the Italian Conference of the University Colleges and the Italian Association of Young Entrepreneurs in collaboration with Italian universities. This is analyzed in the period 2009-2015, during which seven editions were developed. Findings - A framework is presented based on collaborative EL processes to perform relevant entrepreneurial projects in knowledge-intensive enterprises. The framework provides a coherent and systematic approach to generate, select and implement entrepreneurial practices in incumbent companies starting from a project competition involving creative students and innovative entrepreneurs. EL processes in the community composed of entrepreneurs, experts and university students are grouped into the entrepreneurial phases of inspiration, exploration, exploitation, acceleration and growth, and include the learning processes of intuition and sensing, contamination, experiential and contextual learning, experimenting and acting and finally thinking and reflecting. Research limitations/implications - Implications for research can be identified according to many perspectives to deepen the centrality of the learning process in the research on knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship. Practical implications - The framework results to be a promising approach to diffuse an entrepreneurial culture both in incumbent enterprises and in university students through a synergic collaboration among industry, university and institution.

We derive a model and propositions to show how variations in trust and innovation-related collaboration with specific external actors relate to formal and informal appropriability mechanisms. The results show that while trust was strongly associated with open service firms collaborating with other firms, and specifically supply chain partners, in the absence of trust firms pursued a closed approach to innovation or relied on contracts to govern inter-organisational collaborations and appropriability. Formal contracts also underpinned all firm-university interactions to structure and coordinate research and development collaborations and delineate the basis for appropriation of intellectual property (IP) outcomes. Formal Intellectual Property Rights were predominately utilised by firms to capture value from their innovative activities with universities. In contrast, firms negotiated informally IP arrangements with supply chain partners, usually based on shared IP. Thus, a further pattern in the data was that firms' approaches to IP protection and appropriability were contingent on the actor the focal firm was collaborating with.",2019,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10961-018-9696-y,C16,9,2020,Conference Paper,0.163471901,0,0.165523745,0,0.105826962,0,0.154286408,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.107788411,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.687154399,0,0,0.141777296,0,0,0,0.126494444,0,0,0,0.119202855,0,0,0.027477407,0.142589276,0,0,0.074841009,0,0,0.137817927,0.111247657,0,0.077482908,0.080838228,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.12753337,0,0,0,0,0.091915621,0.101754918,0.135898203,0,0.150225919,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.031590956,0,0,0,0,0,0.239044953,0,0,0.075242723,0,0.143373536,0.164688242,0.171438176,0,0,0,0.150668644,0,0.16890061,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.147611862,0.127185802,0,,,,1,1,1,1,,,,,51

Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses primary data collected from 102 European small and medium-sized firms (SMEs) in Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Spain and the UK during 2012-2015 and 2010-2020. This study corrects for potential data disclosure and technology adoption bias in two survey ways. Findings - First, compared to other acumens of knowledge complexity, managerial and operational acumens contribute most the most to a firm's performance (sales and productivity). Firm resilience positively moderates managerial skills and negatively moderates inter-organizational collaborations. Taking SMEs and their inter-organizational relationships, skills and resilience in focus, considering that they are transitive organizations whose business model is based on innovation and productivity to outcompete larger counterparts it is found that resilience and agility in SMEs are important to leverage the effect of knowledge complexity on firm performance. Research limitations/implications - One of the limitations of this study is that SMEs are expected to face more problems in achieving organizational ambidexterity with all three acumens, as they have restricted managerial expertise, less structured procedures and fewer resources than larger firms. In addition to regression analysis which is limited in answering how and why knowledge complexity is managed within and outside a firm, future research will consider a mixed-method approach of both interviews with high growth SMEs and online surveys. To unveil the role that firm resilience in SMEs and in the volatile environment, future research may focus specifically on firms that lack resources, skills and time, however, continue innovating, commercializing new knowledge and create new jobs. Practical implications - One of the most important mechanisms which facilitate the managerial acumen was found to be information technology (IT) investment and management decision-making, exploitation of new information and communication technology trends and markets, innovating business models and driving change management, innovating new mobility and digital technologies, as well as use inter-disciplinary staff and knowledge to influence external stakeholders. The most relevant elements of the operational acumen of knowledge for performance in SMEs are various mechanisms and forms of inter-organizational collaboration such as collaboration on business and IT applications and infrastructure, administration and operations with data and information exchange, collaboration on data availability, accumulation and exchange. Social implications - The findings call for innovation policy to account for the need for interactions between various elements of strategic, managerial and operational acumens of knowledge complexity in SMEs. Prime support should be focused on facilitating inter-organizational collaboration and providing soft support in the time of agility and adversity. This paper founds that lack of budget, skills and resources would significantly affect a firm's resilience, potentially locking in within an organization. Originality/value - First, it emphasizes that the returns from inter-organizational collaboration as part of the operational acumen of knowledge complexity depend upon the firm's ability to manage infrastructure, mobility and data. The relationship is negatively moderated by firm resilience, which means that the most resilient firms may focus on the exploitation of internal resources and substitute it for inter-organizational collaboration. Second, this study demonstrates that SMEs' growth and productivity strategy should be management skills and competencies driven, rather than strategy-driven, with strategy facilitating managerial decision-making on business and IT.",2021,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JKM-03-2020-0178,C5,9,2020,Journal,0.223207216,0.210037383,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.17897948,0,0.211296044,0,0,0,0,0,0.10892877,0.178486964,0,0,0.179970135,0.069533488,0.187650379,0,0,0.193585047,0,0,0.158475937,0,0,0,0.23032759,0,0,0.226718761,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.174136156,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.078940747,0.04313481,0,0,0.480217359,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.233905033,0,0.336195174,0.205725439,0,0,0,0,0.137494381,0.128482728,0,0.177996303,0,0,0,,,,1,1,1,1,,,,,51

It studies transformational leadership and innovation at the organizational level and creativity at the individual level. Design/methodology/approach A theoretical model was created, which entailed the development of variables and hypotheses. A survey instrument was used to obtain data, through a self-completion questionnaire. The final sample was made up of 503 individuals, recruited using a random sampling technique. Findings The results showed that transformational leadership has a significant positive relationship with both followers' creativity and organizational innovation. Furthermore, a significant positive relationship was found between followers' creativity and organizational innovation. In addition, the relationship between transformational leadership and followers' creativity, through the mediating role of employees' psychological empowerment, support for innovation, workplace relationships and employee learning, was also found to be both positive and significant. However, the data showed that intrinsic motivation does not significantly affect the relationship between transformational leadership and creativity. Practical implications - The study provides guidance to organizations that need to change their leadership style and approach, as well as their innovation and creativity mechanisms, at a strategic level.

We argue that entrepreneurial bricolage, the repurposing of resources at hand, can empower resource-constrained firms to solve problems related to eco-innovation in emerging markets. Entrepreneurial bricolage theory provides the foundation for our hypothesis that the primary outcomes of entrepreneurial bricolage are institutional leverage capability (resource mobilization) and compositional capability (resource integration), which in turn affect ecoproduct, eco-process, and eco-management innovation. Based on the findings of a survey of 412 firms in the year 2016 in China, we test the postulated model using partial least squares structural equation modeling. The results show that entrepreneurial bricolage drives eco-process and eco-product innovation mainly through compositional capability, but drives eco-management innovation through both compositional capability and institutional leverage capability.

A wide variety of digital technologies such as blockchain, 3D printing, cyber-physical systems, or big data also diverges the applications of digital technologies in circular business models. Given heterogeneous attributes of circular business models and digital technologies, the selections of digital technologies and circular business models might be highly distinctive within and between sectorial contexts. This paper examines digital circular business models in the context of the fashion industry and its multiple actors. This industry as the world's second polluting industry requires an urgent circular economy (CE) transition with less resource consumption, lower waste emissions and a more stable economy. Design/methodology/approach An inductive, exploratory multiple-case study method is employed to investigate the ten cases of different sized fashion companies (i.e. large, small medium-sized firm (SME) and startup firms). The comparison across cases is conducted to understand fashion firms' distinct behaviours in adopting various digital circular economy strategies. Findings The paper presents three archetypes of digital-based circular business models in the fashion industry: the blockchain-based supply chain model, the service-based model and the pull demand-driven model. Besides incremental innovations, the radical business model and digital innovations as presented in the pull demand-driven model may be crucial to the fashion circular economy transition. The pull demand-driven model may shift the economy from scales to scopes, change the whole process of how the fashion items are forecasted, produced, and used, and reform consumer behaviours. The paths of adopting digital fashion circular business models are also different among large, SMEs and startup fashion firms. Practical implications The study provides business managers with empirical insights on how circular business models (CBMs) should be chosen according to intrinsic business capacities, technological competences and CE strategies. The emerging trends of new fashion markets (e.g. rental, subscription) and consumers' sustainable awareness should be not be neglected. Moreover, besides adopting recycling and reuse strategies, large fashion incumbents consider collaborating with other technology suppliers and startup companies to incubate more radical innovations. Social implications Appropriate policies and regulations should be enacted to enable the digital CE transition. Market patterns and consumer acceptances are considered highly challenging to these digital fashion models. A balanced policy on both the demand and supply sides are suggested. The one-side policy may fail CBMs that entail an upside-down collaboration of both producers and consumers. Moreover, it is perhaps time to rethink how to reduce unnecessary new demand rather than repeatedly producing and recycling. Originality/value The pace of CE research is lagging far behind the accelerating environmental contamination by the fashion industry. The study aims to narrow the gap between theory and practice to harmonise fashion firms' orchestration and accelerate the transition of the fashion industry towards the CE.

Over time, these research consortia financed by FPs have created a network of relations amongst partners, which permits the exchange of information and knowledge amongst institutions and firms.

Indeed, established firms are often adept at introducing successful path-breaking innovations. To explain this apparent paradox, this article draws on the organizational identity literature to present a model that ascribes breakthrough innovations by established firms to managerial identity-dissemination discourse (MIDD). MIDD is argued to provide a sense-giving framework, which fosters an understanding of the firm as a nexus of values around which the firm can be continuously rediscovered and reconstituted in new ways. By exposing the firm as an idea that can assume fresh forms in terms of product-market combinations, MIDD stimulates and coordinates creative endeavor, thus increasing the disposition to produce breakthrough innovations. The model also suggests that the impact of MIDD is likely to depend on transformational leadership and the level of centralization and formalization in the company. The results of a cross-sectional empirical study provide support for the model. In contrast to the focus of earlier research on behavioral and structural explanations for breakthroughs by established firms, this article advances understanding by offering a cognitive explanation. In doing so, the article highlights that creativity and innovation in firms are mentally located in an interpretive schema of the firm's identity, which has important implications in relation to organizing for breakthroughs. The article discusses these implications with particular reference to the use of multifunctional teams and advanced information and communication technologies for facilitating breakthroughs.",2017,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpim.12390,C6,3,2022,Article,0,0,0,0,0.137699276,0,0,0,0.194762326,0,0,0.402709215,0,0,0.140251461,0,0.206900299,0.103803693,0,0,0,0,0.022087317,0,0,0.183951999,0,0.221600823,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.178319885,0,0.357528835,0,0,0,0.292143489,0,0,0,0,0,0.100818733,0,0,0,0.174864439,0.174378563,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.119598201,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.173412478,0,0,0.075226601,0,0,0,0.114405807,0,0.185004049,0,0.334619582,0,0,0.186065092,0.093276947,0,0.074356957,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.165490839,0.150218762,,,,1,1,1,1,,,,,51

However, the disparate streams of literature on productivity and competitiveness have explored innovation and technology transfer as independent predictors. Consequently, the mechanisms through which innovation and technology transfers jointly affect productivity and competitiveness of small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) in emerging economies remain under-explored in literature. The present study sought to examine the relationships among innovation, technology transfer, productivity and competitiveness of small-scale agricultural businesses (SSABs) in selected regions in South Africa and Zimbabwe, neighbouring countries which have been plagued by food insecurity in recent years. Design/methodology/approach A total of 400 questionnaires were distributed to SSABs owners based in Free State and Mashonaland provinces of South Africa and Zimbabwe, respectively. In total, 268 usable questionnaires (67%) were returned for analysis. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) and Process macro (based on SPSS) techniques were used to analyse data. Findings The results supported direct significant paths between innovation and technology transfer; technology transfer and productivity; and productivity and competitiveness. Furthermore, the results suggested that technology transfer and productivity consecutively fully mediate the relationship between innovation and competitiveness. Research limitations/implications The use of a survey could not provide sufficient explanations as to why the variable examined related the way they did. Practical implications The study provides useful insights into the significance of considering the dimensions and methods of innovation and technology transfer in agricultural business activities and processes to improve productivity and competitiveness of SSABs. Social implications The study provides some insights into how innovation and technology transfer could be employed by small scale agricultural businesses as critical mechanisms for heightening productivity and competitiveness of these firms to guarantee food security and employment creation for emerging economies. Originality/value To the researchers' knowledge, this is one of the pioneer studies to examine the impact of both innovation and technology transfer on productivity and competitiveness of SSABs in two countries in Southern Africa. The study also constitutes a significant contribution to examining serial mediation of technology transfer and productivity of innovation and competitiveness.",2022,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EJIM-05-2020-0180,C5,3,2016,Conference Paper,0.098247091,0,0,0.2274507,0,0,0,0,0.08995933,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.095565774,0.047946186,0,0,0,0,0.010201974,0,0,0,0,0,0.09615088,0,0,0.101704244,0,0,0,0,0,0.115598015,0.257089717,0.096742019,0,0.539755983,0,0,0.082828978,0.133720335,0.100422851,0.186269817,0,0,0,0.323074553,0,0,0.154982356,0.076647928,0,0.331449342,0.08594214,0,0,0.122310007,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.090286217,0.034746631,0.018986257,0,0,0,0,0.085452052,0,0,0.055530424,0.045221097,0,0.043083957,0,0.171724742,0,0.277350735,0,0,0,0,0,0.054383587,0.060519651,0.056553074,0.073393725,0.078347014,0.177430322,0,0,,,,1,1,1,1,,,,,51

What is the mechanism by which the different leaderships exert different effects on organizational innovation? Design/methodology/approach - To test the hypothesized model, a data set based on 133 MBA part-time students from Tsinghua University and Zhejiang University in China was built, after interviewing several top managers as a pilot study. With the help of SPSS macro, hierarchical regression and bootstrapping analysis, the paper analyzes the effects of two leadership styles on innovation performance, through the mediation mechanism of openness involving open breadth and open depth. Findings - The results indicate that transformational leadership enhances, while transactional leadership reduces, the organizational innovation performance. The openness breadth and openness depth not only mediate the beneficial effect of transformational leadership on innovation, but also mediate the deleterious effect of transactional leadership on innovation. Originality/value - This study empirically explores the different functions of transformational leadership and transactional leadership for leading organizational innovation performance. Furthermore, a new form of organization is an open design or strategy that allows more external knowledge and resources to be absorbed, which is claimed as a new paradigm for organization innovation.

Therefore, this study empirically tests the influence mechanism and policy intervention effects of inclusive green finance on green innovation by applying the difference-in-differences, mediation effects, and panel vector autoregression models using China's regional data from 2010 to 2019. The findings indicate that green finance significantly contributes to green innovation, and these effects remain consistent across alternative estimators.

The sample contains firms from five world regions, including emerging economies. This approach enables contrast to determine cross-country heterogeneity in PSI outcomes. The results show that, to maximise firm performance, PSI must be developed through a sequential Exploitation-Exploration pathway. Although this optimal sequence is consistent across all world regions (except Japan), noticeable contextual differences emerge in the relative importance of exploration and exploitation to firm performance.

Several institutional and conductive factors affecting a country's capacity to support innovative entrepreneurship are explored. Design/methodology/approach Institutional theory is used to examine the national regulatory, normative, cognitive and conducive aspects that measure a country's ability to support innovative entrepreneurship. A cross-national institutional profile is constructed to validate an entrepreneurial innovation model. The impacts of country-level national institutions on innovative entrepreneurial activity as measured by Global Entrepreneurship Monitor data are assessed through structural equation modeling. Findings Knowledge about the influence of specific institutional aspects on innovative entrepreneurship, and hence of institutional structures within and across countries, is enhanced. For new innovative enterprises, conductive and regulatory aspects seem to matter most. All conductive factors have a significant and positive impact on entrepreneurial activity rates. Research limitations/implications Results could support policy makers and practitioners in evaluating government policies' effects on innovative entrepreneurship. Interventions should target both individual attributes and context. Future research could include longitudinal designs to measure the direction of causality. Practical implications Aspects such as regulatory institutions, and conductive factors such as information communication technology use and technology adoption, are important for innovation entrepreneurship development. Originality/value The literature on institutional theory and innovative entrepreneurship is highly limited. This study complements growing interest in empirical analysis of the effects of national institutions on innovative entrepreneurial activities and substantiates previous empirical work.",2019,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JEIM-07-2018-0165,C1,4,2017,Journal,0.17510722,0.164775418,0,0,0,0.173489279,0,0,0.240503737,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.235465172,0,0.172424709,0,0.080167912,0,0.134396961,0,0,0,0.414989259,0.086591992,0,0.113955238,0.28791024,0.143555128,0,0.138113655,0,0,0.393831326,0,0,0.098457831,0.108997453,0.14557093,0.170848362,0,0,0,0,0,0.160918439,0.123858853,0.033839483,0,0,0.282549759,0,0,0,0.137735844,0,0,0.153175928,0.076789164,0,0.061213502,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.096928659,0,0,0,0,0,0.136238413,0,,,,1,1,1,1,,,,,51

The fsQCA results reveal that a combination of CSR and transformational leadership leads to high performance. Alternately, high performance results from high innovation.

However, little is known about intra-firm employee network dynamics and their consequences for firm exploratory innovation. This paper addresses the gap by focusing on employee co-invention network dynamics conceptualized as employee turnover and across-team movement. Based on the knowledge-based view and transactive memory system theory, this research elaborates on the dual mechanism of employee co-invention network dynamics and proposes an inverted U-shaped relationship between employee co-invention network dynamics and firm exploratory innovation. Furthermore, employees and their innovation are structurally embedded in the intra-firm networks. This paper investigates the moderation effect of intra-firm network structures. First, employee co-invention network centralization, indicating a core-periphery co-invention structure among employees, may negatively moderate the inverted U-shaped relationship. Second, knowledge-employee network equilibrium, indicating an evenly- and broadly- distributed knowledge structure among employees, may positively moderate the inverted U-shaped relationship.

Specifically, the roles of two commercial partnerships are investigated. Additionally, the study explores the moderating effect of external technological uncertainty and internal dynamic capabilities on the relationship between two commercial partnerships and on collaborative innovation. Design/methodology/approach Using a sample of 370 high-tech firms in China, the authors applied the partial least squares structural equation modeling approach to model these relationships. Findings The findings reveal opportunities and challenges for companies according to two intensities of commercial partnership for collaborative innovation. The partnership contribution to innovation and competiveness is different within the two routes and ranges. The findings indicate that (1) intense commercial relationships with business partners have a stronger positive significant impact on collaborative innovation than those with non-business partners and (2) non-business partners have a weaker positive impact on collaborative innovation at high external technological uncertainty. It was also found that (3) the positive impact of business partners on collaborative innovation is weakened when a firm has high dynamic capabilities, whereas the positive impact of non-business partners is strengthened. Research limitations/implications - Insight into the roles of two commercial partnerships in achieving collaborative innovation facilitates the advancement of the theoretical understanding of the circumstances under which cooperative innovation can be more effective under different partnerships. Originality/value A key strategic question is whether comprehensiveness enables firms to make better strategic decisions in various environments. In the process of innovation, companies must choose different types and quantities of partners, and they must regulate their partners' innovative behavior by establishing a corresponding network structure and relationship rules. The current study focuses on analysis of how different intensities of commercial partnerships affect collaborative innovation. This research provides a theoretical framework that creates a new classification of commercial relations with regard to collaborative innovation, and it highlights the difference between the two types of partnerships. This study finds that there are many problems in the selection of innovative partners in China's high-tech companies. Therefore, companies should strengthen their understanding of cooperative innovation, and they should build and manage highly efficient innovation networks.

By adopting an inductive case study of a US MNC subsidiary in India, we found empowerment-focused HRM practices were being used for exploration of new ideas and efficiency-focused HRM practices were adopted for the exploitation of the organisation's existing strengths. Empowerment-focused HRM practices created a culture of openness and risk-taking, which facilitated the creation of an ambidextrous context. Further, ambidextrous learning was moderated by the adoption of a managerial/leadership style that focused on 'mirroring competencies' between the parent operation and its subsidiary. HRM practices were aimed at developing behaviours that valued the team-based co-development of graphic processor designs by means of a 'parallel processing' approach to product development.

In this new competitive landscape we observe new organizational forms and new business models, including the emergence of platforms and multi-sided markets. This emergence has required a strategic response from incumbent firms, including both well-established firms and some first-generation digital enterprises. With these advances in digital technology, the very nature of strategy is changing. Fundamentally, the use of digital technologies may provide new opportunities for efficiency gains, customer intimacy, and innovation. However, without the right mindset for change, appropriate digital routines, and structural changes, digital transformation efforts will fail. We therefore present a framework for strategizing in this new digital competitive landscape that underscores the importance of the interplay between (1) the cognitive barriers faced by managers when trying to understand this new digital world and envision new digital business models, (2) a need to reconfigure and extend digital routines, and (3) new organizational forms that are better equipped to creating value and gaining competitive advantage. From this framework of essential pillars, we derive four journeys of digital transformation for companies that were formed in the pre-digital economy. We also describe the management roles required by top, middle, and frontline managers, depending on whether the digital migration is evolutionary or transformative and whether the firm is responding to or attempting to shape the ecosystem. Although digital transformation is technically all about technology, the more important issue is how companies make their way through this strange new digital world in which they find themselves. Ultimately digital transformation is as much about strategizing as it is about technology.",2021,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lrp.2021.102110,C10,5,2020,Article,0,0,0,0.07728805,0,0.198456173,0.094525848,0,0.04585245,0,0.090173881,0.189617824,0,0,0,0,0,0.048876533,0,0.686116136,0,0,0.010399933,0,0.037939847,0,0.086861956,0.104341953,0,0,0,0.103677712,0.081200835,0.103348401,0,0,0,0.01683444,0,0.0986192,0,0,0,0,0.08443619,0,0,0,0.049526735,0,0.065177285,0,0,0.069430256,0,0,0,0.112626927,0,0,0.056313464,0.062341654,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.035420854,0.038709333,0.094525848,0,0.323211578,0,0.087110163,0.292908848,0,0.056607936,0.046098567,0,0.043919958,0.050449343,0.14004551,0.052476803,0,0,0,0.080308412,0.129349319,0,0.055438845,0,0,0,0,0.180873178,0.155844524,0.070731321,,,,1,1,1,1,,,,,51

What are the prospects for the future of the Chinese national innovation system? Our starting point is the Needham Puzzle - the paradox that while China was once a world leader in technological development, it fell behind; the Industrial Revolution happened in Europe rather than in China. Potential explanations for the Needham Puzzle may shed light on the challenges facing innovation in modern China. We identify three factors that might help explain the Needham Puzzle; assess how the Needham Puzzle and Chinese culture and history have affected the modern innovation system; discuss comparative aspects of innovation ecosystems in the United States and elsewhere; and suggest that Chinese innovation emphasizes exploitation and refinement of existing knowledge to the exploration and development of new knowledge.

Design/methodology/approach This study used a combination of in-depth interviews and large-scale surveys in 15 enterprises in the North, Central and South of Vietnam. In total, 455 valid questionnaires from employees of information technology, telecommunications and e-commerce enterprises have been used in this research to explore the impact of transformational leadership (TL), coworker support (CS) and organizational learning (OL) on employees' IB. The data collected were subjected to quantitative analysis, including Cronbach's alpha reliability test, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) for scales and hypotheses testing. Findings The results show that there are positive relationships between TL, OL and employees' IB, in which OL has a stronger impact than TL.

More specifically, the purpose of this paper is to empirically analyse two types of relationships: between some contextual factors and firms' openness choices; and among openness choices, a set of organizational- managerial and social factors, and OI performance outcomes. Design/methodology/approach - The authors carried out a theory testing survey, involving four European countries (Finland, Italy, Sweden and the UK). The authors applied descriptive statistics and a series of regressions. Findings - The authors analysed the impact exerted by external and internal variables on the collaboration depth with scientific and business partners: technological trends are relevant to move firms towards external collaborations, with both types of partners; efficiency goals pursued in collaborations are related to the collaboration depth with both types of partners, while an aggressive innovation strategy is positively related only to scientificpartner depth. Besides, collaboration depths with both partners are positively related to the both sides of innovation performance (i.e. novelty and efficiency), but the organizational-managerial and social contexts emerge as relevant mediator variables. Organizational-managerial and external relational social capital exert a beneficial role on the both types of innovation performance, while internal relational social capital benefits only novelty. Research limitations/implications - The work shows important limitations such as the low level of the explanatory values in the regression models. Therefore, the results must be considered as preliminary explorative insights that may be useful to encourage further studies. Practical implications - This work serves to raise managers' awareness on the opportunity of developing organizational-managerial mechanisms, as well as on the importance of social capital to profit from collaborations. Originality/value - Although during the last decade many researchers have claimed that we are in the era of OI, empirical works, which provide both a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of the phenomenon, are still few. Moreover, the specific action of the context (managerial, organizational and social) as possible mediator of the performance outcomes of openness is empirically under-studied.

To make up this gap, this study explores the measurement of knowledge transfer efficiency based on the weighted OI network. Firstly, this paper builds the weighted OI network model with node and edge weights. On the basis of the weighted OI network model, the weighted path length and clustering coefficient are introduced and analysed. Moreover, the efficiency of knowledge transfer is further proposed as the main measure of knowledge transfer efficiency by comprehensively embodying the above factors, and then an extended application of the proposed main measure is developed to identify and locate the important members with great impact on knowledge transfer.

It proposes a new approach to reconnect the contingency factors to the optimization of productivity. This helps us to identify the changing characteristics that influence the determinants of decisions, actions and management of the technological projects of the mainly innovative enterprises. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses techniques that effectively solve unobserved endogeneity and heterogeneity problems in enterprises: an empiricalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“structural design. With this method, this study enables rich empirical conceptualization and helps with extending theory. However, there is a need to further the research by taking into account the system analysis and the complexity of the research object: one of the options might be to explore a possible follow-up of the research through drawing on ethnostatistics and qualimetrics. Findings: The analysis reveals that the phenomenon of technological project productivity in operational governance context is thus manifested by the coexistence of the applied governance configuration variables, the contingency factors operationalization, the optimizing productivity mechanisms and this with the secular innovation and stagnation and stagnation. Ceteris paribus, the governance operationalizations have an important role in the productivity of technological projects of the innovative enterprises. Originality/value: This research is the first to mobilize as major determinants of the operationalization of governance, the oversight of the capital, the dividend strategy and the system control, the managerial follow-up, the detection of opportunistic behaviours and the application of governing incentives (among others) as governance configuration variables in order to highlight their interactions with productivity in the innovative firm technological projects.

The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) was used as the theoretical framework. Empirical data (with 215 valid responses) were collected nationwide from the United States via Qualtrics Panel services. Exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation modeling, and multi-group comparison (chi-square difference) were used to estimate construct validity and test the proposed hypotheses and theoretical framework. Results indicated that consumersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ purchase intention towards face masks was predicted by consumersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ attitude towards functional attributes, subjective norm, and perceived behavior control. But, in contrast with previous research, purchase intention was not predicted by attitudes towards aesthetic attributes and attitude towards social attributes. Purchase intention positively influenced consumersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ actual purchase behavior towards face masks. Workplace association moderated the path from social attitudes to purchase intention. Based on these results, theoretical and practical implications are discussed. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

The study aims to incorporate multiple views, i.e. green innovation theory (GIT), the green institutional perspective (GIP) and the natural-resource-based view (NRBV), to develop a comprehensive model to explore why and how firms implement green product innovation (GPI). Design/methodology/approach: The study explores the relationships among institutional pressure, the firm's green resources and GPI. The research also distinguishes two different types of GPI: exploratory GPI and exploitative GPI. A total of 270 valid questionnaires were collected from electrical and electronics manufacturers in Taiwan. The authors employed structural equation modeling (SEM) using analysis of moment structures (AMOS) 23.0 to test the hypotheses. Findings: The results show that institutional pressure has a significant positive correlation with the firm's green resources. Furthermore, institutional pressure has a significantly positive influence on exploratory GPI and exploitative GPI, respectively. The firm's green resources also have a significantly positive effect on both exploratory GPI and exploitative GPI. In addition, institutional pressures have significantly positive indirect effect on both exploratory GPI and exploitative GPI. Research limitations/implications: Economic benefits and environmental sustainability are the most pressing issues faced by the electrical and electronics industry today. The study's investigation covers Taiwanese electrical and electronics manufacturers only, so the test of the research model has limited generalizability. The authors suggest that to expand the generalizability of the findings, future research should examine this model in the context of other regions such as Southeast Asia, Africa, South America, etc. Practical implications: The study has many interesting implications for both practitioners and policymakers. The authors' findings suggest that while Taiwanese electrical and electronics manufacturers face significant pressure from customers, competitors and regulation requirements (e.g. waste electrical and electronic equipment [WEEE], restriction of hazardous substances [RoHS] and energy using product [EuP] directives), firms in that sector should efficiently and effectively deploy their green resources and then perform proper GPI (e.g. exploratory GPI or exploitative GPI). These results also serve as a reminder to policymakers that balancing coercive (command-and-control) mechanisms with incentives and voluntary mechanisms is the best means by which to develop motivational and effective GPI policies. Originality/value: First and foremost, the paper divides GPI into exploratory GPI and exploitative GPI. Furthermore, the research incorporates two important schools of thought, i.e. the GIP and NRBV, thus providing a more holistic view by which to explore why and how companies adopt GPI.

Our aim is to conduct an ex-ante analysis focusing on these two external forces in the context of aquaculture and the adoption of aquaponics technology in Colombia. We use an embedded case-study design incorporating a qualitative and exploratory approach and employ two categories of fish-farming production systems as units of analysis. We triangulate our findings using non-probability sampling techniques and use our findings as a benchmark to discuss the potential adoption of aquaponics technology. Our findings suggest that fluctuations in rainfall and drought are the most important climate variables influencing negatively fish farming activities. Furthermore, we find that the complex institutional structures involved create unequal informal mechanisms among fish-farming production systems.

The MTS is an emerging organizational unit comprised of tightly integrated networks of teams that may originate from one or more firms. The inquiry also considered how an MTS can engage those features and mechanisms to maximize ambidexterity as dynamic capabilities for increased innovation and long-term adaptation under complex, volatile conditions. Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual inquiry integrates the emerging research on MTSs with theory and studies relating to ambidexterity and dynamic capabilities. This inquiry focuses on the attributes and linkages that specially characterize an MTS. It analyzes these to determine the key mechanisms and interactions enabling and engaging ambidexterity at MTS unit level. Findings: MTSs can engage powerful mechanisms for ambidexterity functioning as dynamic capabilities at meso-organizational level. The attributes and linkages that distinguish an MTS from other units enable it to deal effectively and efficiently with near-term task demands by simultaneously balancing the essential tasks of exploration and exploitation, and by being able to rapidly adapt by reconfiguring taskwork and reallocating resources as required for sustainable innovation and long-term success within a dynamic environment. Practical implications: This inquiry provides valuable insights for designing MTSs that are equipped with selected teams, flexible memberships, specialized skills and permeable interfaces. Autonomy for an MTS allows the unit to span internal and external organizational boundaries to gain access to new discoveries and to exchange information and material resources for increased innovation. Ambidexterity as dynamic capabilities facilitates exploitation of current resources by efficiently reconfiguring taskwork and reallocating materials for adaptation and competitive advantage. Originality/value: This inquiry appears to represent the most integrative effort to examine the underexplored potential of MTSs for developing and engaging ambidexterity functioning as dynamic capabilities.

The case study is analyzed through critical events and adopting the 4 R model, developed within the industrial marketing and purchasing (IMP) approach. Findings The analysis highlights a transition from knowledge broker to solution provider, based on a process of networking, with a relevant strategizing effort, and of assembling internal, external and shared resources. Three patterns in the evolution of the company's innovation path emerge: resource-oriented networking, hybrid resource development and resource assembly.

Despite the lack of resources, it has managed to maintain leading positions in the high-tech industries including oil production, oil and produced gas processing, energy, space technology, military technology and others. In Russia there was no clear mechanism for bringing the results of scientific research to a commercial level, i.e. to the implementation stage. For this and some other reasons, the share of innovative products in the total volume of products is small. About 6% of enterprises are actively participating in the innovation process, while in the United States the number of enterprises makes up about 30%. In the context of the emerging global economy, the standard of living of the population, investment attractiveness and the place of the state in the modern world are determined by the degree of innovation development of the national economy.

Building upon the ideas of transformational and transactional leadership (TFL and TAL), explorative ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and exploitative ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ learning (ERL and ETL), dynamic capabilities (DCs) and intellectual capital architecture (ICA), this paper develops a model of organizational learning. The model explains how leadership styles trigger versatile learning, and how DCs and ICA of a firm influence this process. Design/methodology/approach: This paper builds upon a systematic review of the literature to develop propositions delineating the complex and poorly understood relationship between leadership styles, organizational learning and the role of DCs and ICA in this process. The paper develops multiple propositions, which together constitute an overarching framework explaining how leadership styles shape organizational learning. Findings: Leadership approaches, DCs and ICA of a firm all have a differential effect on ERL and ETL. TFL and TAL promote ERL and ETL, respectively. The presence of DCs facilitates the effect of TFL in supporting ERL but negatively influences the role of TAL in ETL. The effect of ICA is discussed in terms of knowledge stocks (generalist vs specialist), social architecture (entrepreneurial vs cooperative) and organizational capital (organic vs mechanistic). The generalist knowledge facilitates TFL ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ ERL, while the specialist knowledge facilitates TAL ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ ETL path. Entrepreneurial architectures are suitable for TFL ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ ERL, while cooperative structures promote TAL ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ ETL trajectory. Finally, organic systems facilitate TFL ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ ERL, while the mechanistic systems promote TAL ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ ETL. Originality/value: The key contribution of the paper is in developing a model furnishing profound insights into leadership approaches and organizational learning and the role of two critical factors. To the best of the authorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s knowledge, these aspects have not been discussed in a unified framework in the previous studies. Hence, the paper is novel in its contribution.

The purpose of this study is to explore how different forms of tacit knowledge are externalized by taking a participatory agricultural research group as a case study for the surfacing, codifying and transferring of tacit knowledge. We conducted a qualitative case study that used semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, observation and document analysis. The study revealed that the dominant forms of tacit knowledge externalized in this participatory agricultural research group fall under a low degree of tacitness (practical skills, lived experiences, rules-of-thumb and expertise) and a medium degree of tacitness (judgments, insights, practical intelligence and indigenous knowledge). Tacit knowledge externalization mechanisms identified include metaphor, storytelling, dialogue, apprenticeship or mentoring, experimentation and evaluation, observation, learning by doing, lessons learnt, modeling technique, localization and on-farm demonstration. A tacit knowledge externalization framework is proposed for the study context. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2019 IEEE Computer Society.

Bureaucratic rigidities of the organisations do not allow them to deal with increasing complexity as they lack environments that encourage the knowledge flow, risk taking and flexibility on which adaptation thrives. The centralised power structure generates defensive mechanisms and discourages individuals to learn and to share knowledge. To remain flexible and adaptive the bureaucracies need to sustain their competitive advantage by capitalising on knowledge and experience of their experts. The leadership needs to think holistically about combining conditions of hierarchy and discipline with other forms of cooperation. Communities of practice can become the spaces of explicit and especially tacit knowledge exchange outside the usual organisational constraints and can foster environment of learning and collaboration internally and externally. However, there are many examples of failure to evolve them into a sustainable entity. This paper explores the process of cultivating communities of practice within a hierarchical organisation that manages large infrastructure programmes. It aims at studying how application of problem structuring techniques can assist the organisation under scrutiny in understanding the key sponsors' perceptions regarding communities of practice and how that can contribute to reducing a tension between a need to capitalise on expert knowledge and the individuals who are discouraged to learn by control structure of a hierarchical organisation.",2017,Conference Paper,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85035322961&partnerID=40&md5=40e84f31a26347b1e845b7956f111e3c,C13,1,2017,Article,0,0,0,0,0.111932122,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.178986755,0,0,0,0,0,0.145312896,0.603261017,0,0,0.395792939,0,0,0,0,0.176731664,0.081952898,0.171003574,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.12178493,0.194436469,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.177290729,0,0.167164502,0,0.061149727,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.159360721,0,0,0.310445109,0.191416628,0,0,0,0,0,0.269046307,0,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,36

This paper explores the evolution of nanotechnology via an analysis of the patent co-classification from the database at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). A total of 518 patents on nanotechnology were analyzed. The trend of nanotechnology and the patents of high betweenness centrality were identified. It was found that the technical classifications of ""semiconductor device manufacturing"" and ""chemistry of inorganic compounds"" have the highest potential for future growth. These classifications have shown a stable number of filed patents and have become the mainstream in nanotechnology development since the 1980s. Furthermore, this study also showed that the patents owned by the US comprise a significant portion of the applications in the major technical classifications, which has played an important role in the evolution of nanotechnology. The results demonstrated that an analysis of the patent network can be a useful tool for both understanding and predicting the trend of an emerging technology.

Drawing data from 50 Pakistani autoparts suppliers, the findings suggest that industrial policy has been helpful in creating a local parts supply base and facilitating the entry of Japanese assemblers in the market. However, the implementation of the policy has been weak, and it is an arduous journey for the local suppliers to develop ambidextrous (exploratory and exploitative) learning capabilities. The findings also indicate that where local training and support from R&D institutions are weak, networking alone with foreign multinationals is not sufficient on its own to develop exploratory learning capabilities of local suppliers.

While focal vision may help detect signals that relate to the current objectives of the firm, peripheral vision is directed to non-central issues that may provide signals that relate to emerging trends in the external environment. Ambidexterity vision refers to the tension between these two different business visions within the same organization. This paper aims to examine the significance of procedural memory to an organizationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ambidexterity vision, along with investigating the impact procedural memory has on organizational learning. Design/methodology/approach: The research conducted in this study addresses the following two questions: Does the enhancement of procedural memory result in the development of superior ambidexterity vision? Does the simultaneous development of both focal and peripheral vision enhance organizational learning? These research questions are studied by conducting an empirical investigation involving data provided by 203 banking employees. These data are analysed using a structural equation modelling approach. Findings: Analysis of the data provides support for the existence of a relationship between ambidexterity vision and organizational learning. Practical implications: The findings suggest that the re-direction of managersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ perceptions to supporting and enhancing an ambidexterity vision is likely to result in an improvement in their ability to identify emerging trends, new and emerging customers and potential shifts in customer needs and tastes.

However, if an innovation is not widely applied, it will be difficult to have any real impact on the social economy. So only when an innovation diffused in the social system it can realize its true value. The diffusion of new products as an embodiment of innovation is the key to realize the value of innovation. It is also a basis for the innovation to have any influence on society. With the development of the Internet and Web2.0, social networks like WeChat, blogs, online community, and e-commerce's customer reviews that are characterized by user-generated content, have become more and more widely used. Social media increases interpersonal interdependence and makes interpersonal influence deeper and wider. The new product adopters, especially imitators, who account for 97.5% of all in the system (when innovation is fully diffused) adopt a new product because of interpersonal influence. Thus, interpersonal influence plays a vital role in the diffusion of a new product. Since information exchange occurs mainly among identical or similar individuals (peers), and this is the fundamental means of interpersonal communication, put it differently, individuals are more inclined to choose peers to communicate and interact. Hence, individuals are more influenced by peers than others, especially in the context of social networks; individuals can find and interact with peers who have the same interests or preferences more conveniently and efficiently. Therefore, peer influence on new product diffusion in social networks contexts is larger and deeper than in conventional contexts. How does peer influence play a role in the user's new product adoption intention formation? That is, what is the new product diffusion mechanism based on peer influence? The discussion of this question not only helps scholars to better grasp the cause and effect of the user's new product adoption but also helps the company to better implement the promotion and marketing strategies of new products based on peer influence. However, the existing researches either explore the process of new product diffusion in a certain social system from a macro perspective, such as the Bass model and its extension model or investigate influence factors of new product diffusion from a micro perspective, such as personal characteristics, external factors, and product innovation attributes. All of those have not explored the influence mechanism. For this reason, this study introduces peer influence, a concept from social psychology, into the field of innovation diffusion. Based on the relevant literature, and combined with the use gratification theory, this paper further perfects and supplements the formation process of peer influence, which is based on the influence process theory and the homogenization theory. Motivation drives the formation of peer influence. With peer interaction, peers are unnoticeably influenced to have homogeneous behaviors or opinions, or with interaction, mutual trust is formed, which results in homogeneous behaviors or opinions ultimately. Based on this process, a model was built to study new product diffusion under peer influence in the context of the social network. Data was acquired through the delivery on the network using the snowball method to test the model empirically. The model was revised based on the results of empirical analysis at last. The results show that for the new product diffusion, the information motivation and reward motivation of adopters are the antecedents. This conclusion shows that the new model used by the paper is a further improvement of the homogenization theory and the influence process theory. It shows that user-involved peer-to-peer communication about new products is not a purposeless behavior, but driven by the motivation to obtain more information or gain internal and external compensation to reduce the risk of adopting a new product and maximize the self-interest. Peer communication is the necessary link; the trust composing perceived similarity and benevolence plays a partial mediating role in peer communication and adaption intention and is the direct influence factor of new product diffusion. This conclusion further validates the explanatory power of homogenization theory in the new era, new situation, and new product diffusion field. The influence process theory is only a supplement to the homogenization theory. It cannot completely replace it, because perceived similarity and benevolence, as two dimensions of trust, play a partial mediating role in the new product diffusion, but not a fully mediating role. Peer communication does not influence adoption intention by a trust. In addition, the indirect effect value of the path of the mediating effect is relatively low. However, the trust established in communication plays an active role in the promoting users' willingness to adopt, is one of the direct influencing factors of the new product diffusion, and the higher the trust, the better the communication effect, and the greater the influence on the willingness to adopt.

In response, the purpose of this paper is to present a research model that takes information technology (IT) culture as a theoretical lens and personal innovativeness and experience in IT projects as theoretical constructs to predict behaviour and traits that explain DE success. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the literature review, the authors propose hypotheses and a research model. The authors tested the model using structural equation modelling (SEM), by surveying a sample of digital entrepreneurs operating in the Yabacon Valley, Lagos, Nigeria. Findings: The results indicate that IT culture is an essential predictor of achieving DE success. The results also suggest that an entrepreneur's innovativeness in IT and experience in IT projects have significant negative and positive moderating effects on the relationship between IT culture and achieving DE success. Research limitations/implications: This paper taps into a new setting ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ DE context ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ by exploring the moderation effects of an entrepreneur's innovativeness in IT and experience in IT projects on the link between their IT culture and achieving a successful DE outcome. Practical implications: This model offers managers an understanding of how IT culture and personal innovativeness and experience in IT work together to achieve DE success. Meanwhile, it sheds some light on managers to treat individuals with different levels of experience differently. Originality/value: The authors theorise IT culture, personal innovativeness and experience in IT and show their effects on DE success, thus making an essential contribution to the information systems (ISs) and entrepreneurship research and practice. Moreover, the authors provide a novel methodology to conceptualise IT culture as a second-order hierarchical reflective construct by giving evidence that partial least squares (PLS) path modelling can assess a hierarchical model with moderating effects. This study answers scholars' call to construct more accurate explanations of innovation outcomes in an increasingly digital world.

This article analyses how 31 transdisciplinary projects conceptualised the link between transdisciplinary co-production of knowledge and sustainability transformations, and as part of an institutional learning process explores what experiences projects garnered while implementing their theories of change. The research identified three generic conceptualisations of impact generation mechanisms: a) promoting systems, target, and transformation knowledge for more informed and equitable decision-making, b) fostering social learning for collective action, and c) enhancing competences for reflective leadership. It also identified seven different strategies through which the studied projects implemented these three generic mechanisms to induce sustainability transformations. Exploring potentials and limitations of the different mechanisms, the article concludes that the question is not which mechanisms or strategies are better than others, but in what situation and combination they might be most promising.

Further, gaps related to knowledge sharing influence on firms' competitiveness from an emerging economy perspective was a major driver of this study. Background: The relevance of knowledge sharing is today crucial for firms that seek to harness internal resource innovation towards ensuring increased competitiveness. The link between the actions of leaders and outcomes from sharing knowledge towards increased competitiveness would further advance theory on knowledge sharing and provide managerial implication that is instrumental for an improved organisational outcome. Methodology: The study sample was 282 participants and Partial least square structural equation model was used for the analysis of the data obtained through a questionnaire survey with the aid of SmartPLSv3.9. Contribution: The study contributes to knowledge management literature through advancing leadership as a mediating factor that accounts for the link between knowledge sharing and firms' competitiveness, most especially from an emerging economy perspective. Findings: Knowledge sharing was found to have a positive effect on firms' competitiveness. The study found that leadership behaviour mediates the relationship between knowledge sharing and a firm's competitiveness. Recommendations for Practitioners: The study recommends that, when supported with the right attitude from leaders in the organisation, knowledge sharing will be beneficial towards the firm gaining competitiveness most especially. Future Research: Future studies should be carried out in other sectors aside from the manufacturing sector using the same measures used to measure knowledge sharing. Also, a comparative analysis of knowledge sharing and firms' competitiveness using leaders' behaviour as a mediator should be researched in other developing economies.

Conventional means, such as questionnaire, survey and self-report with predefined questions and prompts, are used to collect information about usersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ experience during various UX studies. However, such data is often limited and restricted by initial setups, and they won't easily allow designers to identify all critical elements such as user profile, context, related product features, etc. Meanwhile, with widely accessible social media, the volume and velocity of customer-generated data are fast-increasing. While it is generally acknowledged that such data contains important elements in understanding and analyzing UX, extracting them to assist product design remains a challenging issue. In this study, how UX data underlying product design can be isolated and restored from customer online reviews is examined. A faceted conceptual model is proposed to elucidate the crucial factors of UX, which serves as an operational mechanism connecting to product design. A methodology of establishing a UX knowledge base from customer online reviews is then proposed to support UX-centered design activities, which consists of three stages, i.e., UX discovery to extract UX data from a single review, UX data integration to group similar data and UX network formalization to build up the causal dependencies among UX groups. Using a case study on smart mobile phone reviews, examples of UX data discovered are demonstrated and both customers and designers concerned key product features and usage situations are exemplified. This study explores the feasibility to discover valuable UX data as well as their relations automatically for product design and business strategic plan by analyzing a large volume of customer online data.

Different theories of adolescent behaviour attribute this to different internal mechanisms like undeveloped cognitive control, higher sensation-seeking or extraordinary social motivation. Many agree that some of adolescent risk-taking behaviour is adaptive. Here we argue that to understand adolescent risk-taking, and why it may be adaptive, research needs to pay attention to the adolescent environmentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ structure and view adolescents as learning and exploring agents in it. We identify three unique aspects of the adolescent environment: 1) the opportunities to take risks are increased significantly, 2) these opportunities are novel and their outcomes uncertain, and 3) peers become more important. Next, we illustrate how adolescent risk-taking may emerge from learning using agent-based modelling, and show that a typical inverted-U shape in risk-taking may emerge in absence of a specific adolescent motivational drive for sensation-seeking or sensitivity to social information. The simulations also show how risky exploration may be necessary for adolescents to gain long-term benefits in later developmental stages and that social learning can help reduce losses. Finally, we discuss how a renewed ecological perspective and the focus on adolescents as learning agents may shift the interpretation of current findings and inspire future studies.

Motivated by the creative prospects of metaphoric representations and shared stories, this study explores the possibilities of harnessing LSP for co-creative learning in innovation laboratories.

Findings from the workshop show variability in representations, interactions and reflections, shaping possibilities for co-creative learning in innovation laboratories. Representations focus on systems, solutions and problems during fragmented, model-supported, model-mediated and integrated interactions that underpin a range of instance-based, variance-based, convergence-based and divergence-based reflections.

While the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's (TRC) Calls to Action could be a focusing event, creating a window of opportunity for transformative social innovations; we see coalescing of interest, social capital and investment in decolonization and indigenization in the proliferation of professorships, programs, installations and statements. However, Blackfoot (Siksika) Elder Roy Bear Chief raised significant concerns that Indigenous knowledge, experiences and people are not yet seen as relevant and useful in higher education; such marginalization must be addressed at a systems level for authentic reconciliation at any colonial university. The purpose of this paper was to explore this dual goal of exploring barriers to and opportunities for Indigenous knowledges and knowledge holders to be valued as relevant and useful in the Canadian academy, using a complexity- and systems-informed lens. Design/methodology/approach Local Indigenous Elders provided guidance to reflect study purpose and target audience of academics, with an approach that respectfully weaved Westernized research methods and co-learning through indigenous knowledge mobilization strategies. This analysis extends results from a qualitative grounded theory study to explain social processes of professors and administrative leadership in a Canadian mid-sized university regarding barriers and facilitators of implementing TRC Calls to Action. This further interpretation of applied systems and panarchy heuristics broadens understanding to how such micro-social processes are positioned and influence larger scale institutional change. Findings This paper discusses how the social process of dominionization intentionally minimizes meaningful system disruption by othering indigenous knowledge and knowledge holders; this form of system-reinforcing boundary work contributes to rigidity and inhibits potentially transformative innovations from scaling beyond individual niches and moments in time. Elders' consultation throughout the research process, including co-learning the meaning of findings, led to the gifting of traditional teachings and emerging systems and multi-scale framework on the relevance of indigenous knowledges and peoples in higher education. Research limitations/implications This study was performed in one faculty of one Canadian institution; an important and potentially widely-present social process was identified. Further research is needed for greater generalizability. Conditions that led to this study are increasingly common across Canada, where at least one third of higher education organizations have explicit indigenization strategies and internationally where the rights and self-determination of indigenous peoples are growing. Social implications Insights from this study can inform conversations about social innovation in institutional settings, and the current systems' resistance to change, particularly when exploring place-based solutions to national/international questions. These initiatives have yet to transform institutions, and while transformation is rarely rapid (Moore et al., 2018), for these potential innovations to grow, they need to be sustainable beyond a brief window of opportunity. Scaling up or deep within the academy seems to remain stubbornly elusive despite attention to the TRC. Originality/value This study contributes to a growing literature that explores the possibilities and opportunities between Indigenous epistemologies and social innovation study and practice (McGowan, 2019; Peredo, McLean and Tremblay, 2019; Conrad, 2015), as well as scholarship around Indigenization and decolonization in Canada and internationally.",2020,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/SEJ-10-2019-0074,C10,1,2018,Journal,0,0,0,0.133774007,0.224444323,0,0,0,0.079363704,0,0,0,0.152074488,0,0,0.519391781,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.018000723,0,0,0,0,0,0.339303994,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.532195008,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.151206048,0,0,0.144110628,0.169134489,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.306540893,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.13635414,0,0,0,0,0,0.060599436,0,0.163122466,0,0,0,0.044776849,0,0,0,0,0.129498471,0,0,0,0,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,36

While news summarization has been a research topic for decades, this new feature is poised to usher in a new line of news summarization techniques. There are two fundamental approaches: mining the questions from data associated with the news story and learning the questions from the content of the story directly. This paper provides the first study, to the best of our knowledge, of a learning based approach to generate a structured summary of news articles with question and answer pairs to capture salient and interesting aspects of the news story. Specifically, this learning-based approach reads a news article, predicts its attention map (i.e., important snippets in the article), and generates multiple natural language questions corresponding to each snippet. Furthermore, we describe a mining-based approach as the mechanism to generate weak supervision data for training the learning based approach.

Basic research in the emerging field of SAS has triggered advanced general-AI technologies that either function without human intervention or synergize humans and intelligent machines in coherent cognitive systems. This work presents a theoretical framework of SAS underpinned by the latest advances in intelligence, cognition, computer, and system sciences. SAS are characterized by the composition of autonomous and symbiotic systems that adopt bio-brain-social-inspired and heterogeneously synergized structures and autonomous behaviours. This paper explores the cognitive and mathematical foundations of SAS. The challenges to seamless human-machine interactions in a hybrid environment are addressed. SAS-based collective intelligence is explored in order to augment human capability by autonomous machine intelligence towards the next generation of general AI, cognitive computers, and trustworthy mission-critical intelligent systems.

This concept combines transportation and ecological sustainability which is the backbone of the transportation system, ecosystem, municipal well-being and town development. The implementation of green highway in an expressway design is a critical initiative towards the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal (SDGs). The Malaysia Green Highway Index (MyGHI) manual was introduced to support the green highway in the Malaysian context. However, MyGHI is relatively new to such endeavors and a mechanism to measure a successful green highway is still lacking. The purpose of this study is to provide an integral knowledge on the factors influencing green highway implementation and determine the level of importance for each factor. Model constructs were introduced and established from the literature concept and theory as well as from exploratory data using the qualitative approach. Transcribed interview data analysis was analysed using Nvivo, Microsoft Excel and Critically Index assessment. It was found that three factors that affect the success of green highway are innovation; construction activities; and material and resources. Twelve experts from government and private agencies participated in contributing to factors and perspectives towards multiple theories and concepts to produce the green highway model. Hence, the idea of developing a model for a green highway is valid and justified, but is limited to the expressway in the Malaysian context.

In this paper, the role of parental involvement in shaping the school learning climate is explored within a multilevel and hierarchical modeling framework using data from the 2015 PISA round. As the schoolsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ social and relational character, we find that reducing learning barriers is a critical challenge for school leadership. A welcoming environment for parents, as well as the effective design of effective forms of two-way communications, are positively associated with a substantial reduction in the barriers to improving teacher managementÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s learning climate. We also find that public schools facing social and educational inclusiveness challenges can dramatically enhance their learning environment by activating specific parental involvement mechanisms. Similarly, principalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s leadership in framing and communicating goals and curricular development to the school is also found to be significant for inclusiveness. However, parental involvement is also found to have potential tensions with school management. The worsening of the learning climate may arise due to pressures brought about by laws requiring parental involvement in schools. Because the learning climate is composed of a wide variety of relationships between and within schools, this work demonstrates that parental involvement is an integral part of school leadership and the school improvement process. Further research attention is encouraged to understand the tensions between teacher roles, principal leadership, and parental involvement through employing other quantitative or qualitative research designs.

MI can improve Internet of Things (IoT) in several ways, such as optimizing the management of large volumes of data or improving automation and transmission in large-scale IoT deployments. When considering MI in the IoT context, MI services deployment must account for the latency demands and network bandwidth requirements. To this extent, moving the intelligence towards the IoT end-device aims to address such requirements and introduces the notion of Distributed MI (D-MI) also in the IoT context. However, current D-MI deployments are limited by the lack of MI interoperability. Currently, the intelligence is tightly bound to the application that exploits it, limiting the provisioning of that specific intelligence service to additional applications. The objective of this article is to propose a novel approach to cope with such constraints. It focuses on decoupling the intelligence from the application by revising the traditional device's stack and introducing an intelligence layer that provides services to the overlying application layer. This paradigm aims to provide final users with more control and accessibility of intelligence services by boosting providers' incentives to develop solutions that could theoretically reach any device. Based on the definition of this emerging paradigm, we explore several aspects related to the intelligence distribution and its impact in the whole MI ecosystem.

There may exist certain relations among these attributes, and some attributes may naturally imply or boost others that have been less comprehensively exploited in previous studies. In this paper, we explicitly model the relations among 11 attributes of nodules by way of transfer learning and extract a meta-structure that captures the transferabilities across deep features of these attributes. Specifically, a higher-order transfer learning scheme is proposed by involving three phases, i.e., semantic attribute-specific modeling, semantic attributes transfer modeling and pathologic attribute generalizing, to explore the strongest association across various attributes and to boost the nodule attribute predictions in chest CT images. The proposed approach has been evaluated on the 2632 nodules in the public Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI) dataset. The experimental results suggest that our higher-order transfer approach shows the superior predictive performance not only in the most of the semantic attributes compared with the schemes of learning from scratch and the first-order transfer but also for the pathologic attribute compared with the related studies. In addition, we demonstrate an attribute transfer graph to reveal which attributes combination can supply the most useful information to boost the predictive performance of target attributes.

We systematically review the existing BMI literature, articulating it around three clusters of negative consequences: those affecting the firm as an entity; those affecting the firm's stakeholders; and those that are specific or context-dependent. In a similar fashion, we identify the driving factors and circumstances leading to these negative consequences and group them into four clusters: (1) managerial choices and processes, and three underpinning circumstances that influence such choices or processes; (2) trade-offs between the new and current business models; (3) managers' ability to manage BMI; and (4) context within which BMI is situated. The paper provides the first attempt to gather prior research on the phenomenon and thereby develop a conceptual understanding of the dark side of BMI. Furthermore, by proposing a model that explains how the dark side of BMI may occur, we inform ongoing debates on the theorization of the consequences that may derive from BMI and how these can be managed to support firms' innovative growth, arguing how the disruptive innovation literature can only partially explain the phenomenon. Second, our model provides important foundations to further distil the complex link between BMI and performance.

Technological change is organized in its unique pattern and a new approach that takes place in a systematic and selective manner. Such change is generally molded with the amalgamation of various factors, namely, economic, social or scientific and technological. This paper aims to focus on identifying technological trajectories in a technological ecosystem with the case of m-payment technology. Design/methodology/approach This study constructs a patent citation network for mobile payment service technology through patent citation data and identifies the main evolution process using the main path analysis of the network. The scope of this study focuses on key innovation using social network analysis and patent citation network, validated using the case of a mobile payment system and analyzing its technological trajectory. Findings Analyzing technology evolution provides a greater insight of the overall technology landscape to the researcher and practitioner. Analyzing the m-payment technology landscape gives three main categories of m-payment systems: the mobile financial transaction system), the payee mobile device payment selection system and e-wallet services. Originality/value The novelty of this research lies in the process of identifying technological evolution using social network and patent citation network analysis.

Many studies have also used the construct of slack to explore how it affects a firm's innovation/performance. Even so, only a vague relationship has been drawn between a firm's slack and its corporate greening. Drawing on green innovation literature, institutional theory, and firm slack from a resource-based view, we argue that two antecedents (i.e., institutional pressure and the firm's green slack) positively influence companies' propensity to engage in green product innovation (GPI) and improve their results (e.g., green new product success, aka GNPS). In particular, this research empirically investigates the indirect relationship between institutional pressure and GPI through the firm's green slack. This study also tests the mediating role of GPI in the relationship between the two antecedents and GNPS. We test our proposed model using a sample of 170 Taiwanese high-tech firms, including both electrical and electronics manufacturers.

We cross research on disruptive innovation with research on managerial cognition and we focus on the role of managerial beliefs about customer needs in directing the search for new markets and product features. We show that a primary reason why incumbents lose their leadership is the inability to recognize either the rising 'social' market, where customers use products for fulfilling their need for friendship, or the 'esteem' market, where customers use products for fulfilling their need for achievement. We then apply our emerging conceptual framework to the case of the smartphone industry and the ongoing rivalry among operating systems. We thus try to advance the disruptive innovation theory with regard to both the explanation and the anticipation of technology competition outcomes.

In the supply chain, more and more suppliers endeavour to collaborate with buyers in order to develop new products and services. Trust is believed as a determinant of successful collaboration for innovation. Therefore, the purpose of this research note is to investigate the relationship between suppliers' trust in buyers and supplier-buyer collaboration and how this relationship relates to radical innovation in the context of a developing country. This research note is based on a quantitative approach to analyse the data of 225 firms in Vietnam- as a developing country. The proposed model is tested with exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modelling (SEM). Findings show that suppliers' trust in buyers can facilitate information sharing, joint decision making, and benefit/risks sharing among them. Furthermore, our results indicate that collaboration between supplier and buyers in sharing information, joint decision-making process can result in radical innovation. The results also confirmed that supplier's trust in buyers can lead to radical innovation through information sharing and joint decision making. The findings of this study have an implications for developing the long-term relationship between suppliers and buyers and help firms to achieve radical innovation in emerging economies. By having trust in buyers, suppliers can save time and efforts in communicating with buyers. Also, managers can encourage buyers to take part in the creative process to develop new products and services and help firm to gain the sustainable competitive advantages. This study also contributes to the literature by providing a theoretical model of successful supply chain collaboration and radical innovation, which can be applied in the context of developing countries. This study investigates the role of supplier's trust in the supplier-buyer collaboration in the context of a developing country to achieve radical innovation.

Prior work on organizational path dependence suggests that firms experience decreasing option spaces over time and ultimately arrive at lock-in situations that prevent them from reacting to changing environmental conditions. Contemporary business practice, however, challenges these assumptions, as firms-even industrial-age incumbents-appear to be able to escape lock-ins and restore choices. One potential explanation for this could be the flexible nature of digital technologies that are increasingly integrated into business models during digitalization. To explore how and why this process affects organizational path dependence, we conducted a longitudinal multiple case study on connected car business models. We derive four business model archetypes adopted by different companies in the automotive industry and by new entrants, and we describe their evolution over time. We find that the growing integration of digital technologies into business models increases the number of possible pathways and can help to break path-dependent behavior.

Bidding behaviors of suppliers do not always align with predictions from rational agent models due to task uncertainty and bounded rationality, which could result in non-optimal supplier offers and ultimately hurt buying firm interests. This paper aims to discuss the aforementioned issues. Design/methodology/approach The authors built an analytical model that considers the impact of supplier technological risk, buyer-supplier coordination cost and supplier loss aversion on the optimal bid of the supplier. Next, using limited information processing capacity as a theoretic lens, the authors explore antecedents to the size of a focal supplier's bidding error, the absolute difference between the actual bid and the optimal bid. The authors used quantitative lab experimental data to test the hypotheses. Findings (1) Bounded rational bidders often fail to differentiate between relevant and irrelevant competitive information when placing bids, (2) loss aversion of a bidder significantly affects not only levels of bids, particularly for bidders with competitive disadvantages, but also sizes of the bidding error and (3) competitive information that has clearer performance implications are more influential in reducing sizes of bidding errors.

Although these demands vary by a firm's context, the focus has been largely on established long-lived multinational enterprises (MNEs) that are not based on digital technologies. There is thus a need to extend theory to take into account the co-existence of rapid growth and digitization, a condition which is increasingly prominent. This study of globally scaling digital firms shows that they navigate the paradoxical demands of replication, to achieve frictionless rapid growth, and entrepreneurship, to innovate and remain competitive. We provide a theoretical model, which shows how MNEs navigate this global scaling paradox through a virtuous cycle of identifying innovations that can be replicated. Surprisingly, given the ease of modifying digital products and services, navigating the global scaling paradox involves minimizing local responsiveness, which is regarded as antithetical to replication. This research also builds insights on the global strategies of digital firms. Managerial summary Many digital firms strive to scale globally to achieve market dominance in competitive, fast-paced industries, but only a few succeed. Studying software-as-a-service firms that have successfully scaled globally, we illustrate that the core demands of global scaling are replication and entrepreneurship. Although contradictory, both demands need to be satisfied in tandem. Leaders of globally scaling firms can achieve this through a strategy that sustains three interrelated mechanisms: top-down replication, bottom-up entrepreneurial orientation, and replicable innovation generation to engender and screen replicable ideas. These mechanisms represent a virtuous cycle through which globally scaling digital firms can revise their global business model in a replicable way in order to sustain competitiveness.",2022,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/gsj.1435,C10,5,2020,Journal,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.14960669,0.131014544,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.079736812,0,0,0,0,0.016966374,0,0,0.141302737,0.141705947,0,0,0.116005771,0,0,0,0.16860181,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.501614273,0,0,0,0.309775658,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.127469189,0,0.183738729,0,0,0.091869364,0,0,0,0.450450953,0,0,0,0.157967243,0,0,0,0,0,0.175761652,0,0.284221739,0,0.128519024,0.184699527,0.150409715,0,0.071650692,0,0,0,0.153749201,0,0,0.131014544,0.084407806,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,1,,1,1,,,,,36

Our dynamic learning process model suggests that (1) in the pre-founding phase, an interactive vicarious learning and intuitive learning mechanism enables returnees to make sense of overseas knowledge; (2) during the founding phase, blended learning mechanism - the balancing act between market response versus market imposing -helps returnees manage the paradoxical cross cultural tension, importantly (3) in the growth phase, the cycling between unlearning and relearning helps them discard, select and recreate new knowledge in the pursuit of sustainable entrepreneurial growth. The study advances the literature on knowledge recontextualization by clarifying key underpinning learning mechanisms essential for ensuring effectiveness outcomes. It also contributes to the work on returnee entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial learning by demonstrating how international entrepreneurs learn overtime to thrive in a conflicting cultural context.",2022,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.intman.2021.100922,C7,1,2021,Article,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.192206042,0.084734277,0,0,0.175204696,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.038437677,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.191594035,0,0,0,0.155161492,0,0.248877269,0,0,0,0.254202831,0,0.142052213,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.10406599,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.065456927,0,0,0,0.298643794,0,0,0,0.145581278,0.104610167,0.085189094,0,0,0.466146147,0.129400446,0,0,0.278769882,0.170585603,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.167124744,0.431995661,0.13070986,,,,1,,1,1,,,,,36

Thus, the authors aim to understand whether the presence of digitalization forces companies to create, capture and deliver value in new ways, focusing on their social impact. Design/methodology/approach Through the analysis of a case study in the automotive sector, the authors provide evidence that both digitalization and sustainability need to be considered to adequately innovate business models. Moreover, these two dimensions are interrelated, and therefore digitalization sustains sustainability and vice versa. Findings By inductively investigating the evolutionary path along which companies tend to adapt their business models to digitalization and sustainability trends, the authors found that this innovative transformation needs to be as sustainable as possible in order to offer benefits to organizations, customers and society at large. Furthermore, the authors revealed that, at least in the automotive sector, companies and customers are aware of the remarkable consequences of digitalization; however, they are still uncertain regarding the actual adoption of new technologies. Originality/value The literature on business model innovation is quite extensive. However, the role of digitalization in developing sustainable business models to achieve a competitive advantage has been overlooked. This study suggests that, within a specific context, forging a value network of stakeholders is helpful when innovating a business model with a sustainability orientation.",2022,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JSMA-02-2021-0033,C12,2,2016,Article,0.435068722,0,0,0,0,0.215524405,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.112954178,0.071717778,0.081471843,0,0.053080162,0.086975341,0,0,0,0.01129438,0.091440604,0.041202865,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.219387437,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.091698129,0,0,0,0.053786285,0,0.07078286,0,0,0.075401608,0,0.084855226,0,0,0,0,0.061156706,0.067703351,0.090420826,0.106121807,0,0,0,0,0,0.099953873,0,0.021019265,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.085554093,0.061476504,0.050063276,0,0.047697296,0,0.076045065,0,0.204699242,0,0.100248443,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.081252569,0,0.589287553,0.169247939,0.384072857,,,,1,,1,1,,,,,36

In this paper, we contribute to the paradox literature by developing a complex systems approach to how organizational members experience tensions generated by the strategic intent paradox. Specifically, we focus on the unfolding dynamics of vicious cycles experienced by organizations dealing with paradox. Drawing on a case study of a design firm, we demonstrate how a vicious cycle forms through feedback loops and develops dynamic stability over time. On the basis of our findings, we develop a micro-level understanding of vicious cycles, which incorporates defence mechanisms at staff and senior management levels. Our main contribution is a theoretical model of unfolding dynamics of vicious cycles. Our model shows the importance of (1) feedback loops that underpin a vicious cycle and (2) importance of circular causality, reinforcing cycles, and micro-mechanisms in theorizing vicious cycles.

Digital innovation and virtual environments, such as social media platforms, might significantly foster the competitive advantage of museums and their ability to attract new visitors. Particularly in times of crisis, prospective tourists appreciate the addition of a 'digital flavor' to exhibitions and art galleries. Improved experiences, increased loyalty, and overall higher satisfaction result from the introduction of Internet Communication Technologies (ICTs) in museums. Building on experiential marketing and the extended technology acceptance model (TAM2), a conceptual model has been created to better explore the underlying mechanisms between tourists' digital propensity - their positive attitudes towards digital innovation and new technologies - and their degree of economic support to museums. The model was empirically validated through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and tested using covariance-based structural equation modelling (CB-SEM) on a sample collected in 2020 consisting of 201 Italian museum visitors.

I find that MNE entrants develop production and technological capabilities comparatively fast within a narrow range of value chain activities with limited spillovers to the cluster. In comparison, local entrants develop such capabilities more slowly, but within a broader range of value chain activities and with higher spillovers of skills and knowledge, as well as higher participation to building a local entrepreneurial ecosystem. I propose that these effects are moderated by the size of national consumer markets as well as industry context in the guise of project lengths and technological modularity.

I rely on a hierarchical rugged landscape to explore how human problem-solvers are able to detect and exploit patterns in their search for an optimal solution. Empirical findings suggest that solvers do not engage only in local and random distant search, but as they accumulate information about the problem structure, solvers make model-based' moves, a type of cognitive search. I then calibrate an agent-based model of search to analyse and interpret the findings from the experimental setup and discuss implications for organizational search.

A survey was disseminated through various library organization lists to collect input on issues surrounding AI attitude and intentions among librarians in North America. We utilized the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) as a framework and performed structural equation modeling (SEM) and related statistical analyses (using SPSS and AMOS). Our findings confirm that the UTAUT can partially predict the likelihood of AI and related technologies adoption intentions among librarians. The model showed that performance expectancy (PE) and attitude toward use (ATU) of AI and related technologies had significant effects on librarians' intention to adopt AI and related technologies, while social influence (SI) and effort expectancy (EE) did not. We conclude that UTAUT is a viable integrated theoretical framework that, when properly designed and executed within a study, and lends itself to robust statistical analyses such as SEM.

This study integrates the transformational leadership approach by aligning it with Industry 4.0 in order to manipulate the inequitable sustainability. The sustainability of businesses has dramatically been challenged due to digitalisation, smart manufacturing, and technological advancement issues, so therefore innovation has expanded magnitude in boosting the overall performance. The study determines the influence of transformational leadership, innovative performance on organizational sustainability, particularly in the perspective of Industry 4.0. The study is quantitatively analysed, and data collected from ISO textile firms of Pakistan through questionnaires. The collected data analysed on Smart-PLS through measurement model and structural equation modelling with second stage order. The results seem interesting as the association of Industry 4.0 influences the entire relationship significantly. Under the context of the fourth industrial revolution, the transformational leadership approach has uniquely boosted innovation performance and organizational sustainability simultaneously. The results depicted that innovative performance enhances organizational sustainability more after integration with smart technologies of Industry 4.0. Furthermore, the mediation reportedly confirmed in hypotheses found to be statistically significant. The results of the study are essential for the textile industry to develop strategies towards sustainability concerns while emerging the organization with Industry 4.0 to attain operational innovativeness. The outcomes of the research will work as a guideline for Pakistan's Textile Industry to increase the working efficiency and productivity effectively.

The study aims to incorporate multiple views, i.e. green innovation theory (GIT), the green institutional perspective (GIP) and the natural-resource-based view (NRBV), to develop a comprehensive model to explore why and how firms implement green product innovation (GPI). Design/methodology/approach The study explores the relationships among institutional pressure, the firm's green resources and GPI. The research also distinguishes two different types of GPI: exploratory GPI and exploitative GPI. A total of 270 valid questionnaires were collected from electrical and electronics manufacturers in Taiwan. The authors employed structural equation modeling (SEM) using analysis of moment structures (AMOS) 23.0 to test the hypotheses. Findings The results show that institutional pressure has a significant positive correlation with the firm's green resources. Furthermore, institutional pressure has a significantly positive influence on exploratory GPI and exploitative GPI, respectively. The firm's green resources also have a significantly positive effect on both exploratory GPI and exploitative GPI. In addition, institutional pressures have significantly positive indirect effect on both exploratory GPI and exploitative GPI. Research limitations/implications Economic benefits and environmental sustainability are the most pressing issues faced by the electrical and electronics industry today. The study's investigation covers Taiwanese electrical and electronics manufacturers only, so the test of the research model has limited generalizability. The authors suggest that to expand the generalizability of the findings, future research should examine this model in the context of other regions such as Southeast Asia, Africa, South America, etc. Practical implications The study has many interesting implications for both practitioners and policymakers. The authors' findings suggest that while Taiwanese electrical and electronics manufacturers face significant pressure from customers, competitors and regulation requirements (e.g. waste electrical and electronic equipment [WEEE], restriction of hazardous substances [RoHS] and energy using product [EuP] directives), firms in that sector should efficiently and effectively deploy their green resources and then perform proper GPI (e.g. exploratory GPI or exploitative GPI). These results also serve as a reminder to policymakers that balancing coercive (command-and-control) mechanisms with incentives and voluntary mechanisms is the best means by which to develop motivational and effective GPI policies. Originality/value First and foremost, the paper divides GPI into exploratory GPI and exploitative GPI. Furthermore, the research incorporates two important schools of thought, i.e. the GIP and NRBV, thus providing a more holistic view by which to explore why and how companies adopt GPI.",2021,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EJIM-04-2021-0217,C2,3,2019,Article,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.157528511,0,0,0,0.143594523,0.133071696,0,0.100019274,0.227245037,0,0,0.121297824,0,0,0,0.031502808,0,0,0,0,0,0.296905539,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.127167484,0,0,0,0,0,0.347233217,0,0.232846723,0.127884333,0,0,0,0.450069583,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.398072759,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.27879597,0,0.029313954,0,0,0,0,0,0.110907575,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.22847463,0,0,0,0,0.083965888,0,0,0.113316714,0.120964376,0,0.118018546,0.107127379,,,,1,,1,1,,,,,36

Design/methodology/approach - Based on relevant literature review and in-depth interviews, a structured questionnaire was developed as a primary data collection method. Questionnaires were distributed to a sample of 558 manufacturing organisations in Jordan, out of which 355 were returned and valid for the analysis. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were applied to reveal NPD performance success measures dimensions. Findings -This study empirically showed that manufacturing organisations in Jordan use a multidimensional construct for NPD performance success measures to assess the success of their new products. The multidimensional construct consists of NPD financial performance, NPD internal learning, NPD capabilities improvement, NPD knowledge sharing and NPD marketing performance. The findings indicate that NPD financial performance is still the dominant dimension amongst the manufacturing organisations while measuring NDP performance. Also, the study has developed an inductive model of NPD performance success measures which shows the construct's dimensions complexity. Research limitations/implications - The fact that the paper is a single country study focusing on the manufacturing industry limits its generalisation to other industries/contexts. The paper's focus on manufacturing organisations limits its contribution to the manufacturing sector. The services sector is a rich field for NPD performance success measures, in addition to being an important contributor to the economy of most, if not all, countries. Further, the paper focuses on only five dimensions of NPD performance success measures, other dimensions of NPD performance success measures might add more insights to their effect on NPD performance success measures. Practical implications - Utilising the findings of this study can help managers make sense of NPD success and failure and plan the NPD strategy and activities across a range of differing situations. The major contribution of this study is increasing the ability of managers to improve their skills and capabilities and focus on the dimensions of NPD success in the best way that enables them to respond effectively to uncertainty caused by changes in the product life cycle which in turn might affect the performance of NPD. The findings urge managers to deal with NPD as a complex process that should be integrated within corporate, business and functional strategies of the firm. Originality/value - The originality of this paper stems from its multidimensional construct of NPD performance success measures as well as in developing an inductive model that shows the complexity of NPD performance dimensions that can be used for assessing the success of new products. The study also has its originality since it is the first empirical work conducted on the manufacturing sector in an emerging market business environment, Jordan.",2016,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EMJB-12-2014-0043,C7,3,2020,Journal,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.233634329,0,0.226661948,0,0,0,0,0,0.081611444,0,0.120393984,0.060402717,0,0,0,0,0.012852471,0,0.046886914,0.214081025,0,0,0,0.0878774,0,0,0,0.127720273,0,0,0,0.145630648,0.107960741,0,0,0,0,0.66497534,0.313044417,0.084230595,0,0,0,0.221587856,0.080547552,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.139186884,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.095675724,0.116817165,0,0,0,0.215305388,0,0,0.069957357,0,0.108270108,0.05427727,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.063941117,0,0.137025138,0,0,0.092461586,0,0.111763566,0.09629808,0,,,,1,,1,1,,,,,36

The objective of this article is to examine the relationship among firms' technological capability-building process, indigenous institutions, and the evolution of a particular technological trajectory within the PPI. To meet this objective, this article draws on a case study design based on primary and long-term evidence gathered through extensive fieldwork in Brazil. This article shows that (1) Brazil's PPI began by developing technological capabilities in long-fiber technology led by global leaders; instead of moving on a subsequent path-following trajectory, these firms accumulated innovative capabilities that led to the development of the short-fiber trajectory; (2) these capabilities initially permitted the implementation of incremental changes in forestry and process technologies, which evolved into sophisticated R & D; and (3) indigenous institutions shaped this trajectory by providing firms with human capital and research support, funding for production and initial innovative capability development, and IPO and entry into export markets. These capabilities and institutions were effective in developing a technological trajectory that enabled Brazil's PPI to achieve an internationally leading position in this industry; however, new capabilities and institutional arrangements are needed to support Brazil's PPI firms' incipient diversification and to mitigate self-reinforcement. This article shows that innovative capability building combined with effective indigenous institutions enable firms even those from a late-industrializing country to create a new technological trajectory. Given the innovation opportunities in the PPI, managers and policy makers should not be satisfied with their achievements; rather, they should be alert to innovative new entrants and explore novel technologically advanced paths.

This study explores informal and formal knowledge exchange networks among two growing industries in Maine: maple syrup production and beekeeping. We increase understanding of the mechanisms through which knowledge exchange occurs by applying adult learning theory. Design/Methodology/Approach: We conducted 46 semi-structured interviews with small- and medium-sized maple syrup producers and beekeepers in Maine. Findings: Maple producers and beekeepers relied on both informal and formal knowledge exchange facilitated by producer associations where the following adult learning theory principles flourished: (1) orientation to learning, (2) prior experience of the learner, and (3) self-concept of the learner. These maple producers and beekeepers also found great value in the community and friendships created through these networks fostering greater expansion within each industry. Practical Implications: Agricultural extension should institute instructional design that features demonstrations, experiential learning, and sharing of fellow producer experiences to help bolster adult learning theory principles. Theoretical Implications: Adult learning theory provides a useful framework in which to explore learning and knowledge exchange among distinct agricultural production practices to help inform future education and training initiatives. Originality/Value: This study is the first to comparatively and specifically examine knowledge exchange among maple producers and beekeepers with application of adult learning theory. This study provides a framework in which to evaluate knowledge exchange among other farming enterprises within an agricultural context to identify effective, meaningful learning mechanisms.",2021,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1389224X.2020.1773283,C14,1,2019,Conference Paper,0.42414488,0,0,0.109103655,0,0,0.400312162,0,0,0,0,0.133836974,0.124029195,0,0,0,0,0.068996544,0,0,0,0,0.029362126,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.143605873,0,0.123320912,0,0,0.064727599,0,0.32553645,0,0,0.144512636,0,0.069914402,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.15898977,0,0.123320912,0.238484655,0,0,0,0,0.133313651,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.456261534,0,0,0,0,0,0.065075029,0,0.185998789,0,0.049423801,0,0.133039726,0,0,0.113367348,0.036519186,0,0.156520461,0,0,0,0,0.127664786,0,0,,,,1,,1,1,,,,,36

Design/methodology/approach - A hypothesis was formulated and tested using structural equation modelling. Data were collected through an instrument that was developed based on key constructs adapted from the literature and that was first validated using Confirmatory Factor Analysis. A Cronbach's alpha test was also conducted and the Composite Reliability Index was calculated to ensure reliability of the theoretical model. The instrument was distributed among manufacturing small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the Aguascalientes region of Mexico, from were 125 valid responses were obtained. Findings - In general, the results indicate that knowledge management has positive effects on the creation of intellectual property in manufacturing SMEs. This suggests that SMEs can create more intellectual property if they dedicate more efforts to the management of knowledge. Practical implications - The implication of this research and its findings may inform the strategies formulated by policy makers, and the managerial practices that manufacturing SMEs can adopt to protect their knowledge. Originality/value - Evidence suggests that studies focused on investigating the relationship between knowledge and intellectual property are limited.

Frugal innovation shows itself as a new approach to technological solutions focused on solving local problems in emerging markets. Frugal innovation can be considered as a summarized concept encompassing other concepts related to low costs innovations in resource-scarce environments, according to Bhatti and Ventresca (2013), Brem and Wolfram (2014), and Hossain (2018). For this exploratory and cross-sectional research, data was collected in September 2018 through questionnaire application to 25 small industrial entrepreneurs from a selected universe of 80 entrepreneurs in the state of Alagoas. The data was made available for this research by the Federation of Industries of Alagoas (FIEA). Descriptive statistics and multidimensional scaling were used to capture the characteristics and perception of these entrepreneurs about: (a) target market; (b) product strategy; (c) the perception of the entrepreneur concerning their product. The main findings show that the companies surveyed do not perceive the low-income customer in the specific market in which they operate, considering that about 2/3 of the surveyed companies expressed that they supply the upper and middle classes market and that they do not have to be engaged in solving emerging problems of the lower-class market. From the perception map, a methodology called Enterprise Positioning Matrix was developed that shows qualified business standards and practices from the quadrants of the perception map. The matrix shows four general characteristics developed by the companies: technological software; technological differentiation; technological hardware; local adaptation. The contribution of this research to the knowledge field of frugal innovation is to enlighten why not all companies in the context of scarcity develop solutions oriented to the local market conditions. So, the contribution that comes up with this research can facilitate to emerge new methodologies and business-oriented solutions to develop and manage frugal innovation capabilities.

Methods: we performed structural equation modeling using the statistical technique of partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) and post hoc analysis to identify unobserved heterogeneity, with a sample of 256 Brazilian companies from different sectors. Results: the results revealed that the SIS had a strong and significant influence on the innovation of exploitation and exploration. The environmental uncertainty of dynamism moderation was not present in the relationship between SIS and the innovation of exploitation. However, SIS showed a strong and significant influence on innovation of exploration in high levels of dynamism. The existence of unobserved heterogeneity was identified for two segments of the sample, demonstrating a strong path effect between SIS and innovation of exploration and exploitation on the high presence of dynamism in service companies with a size greater than 500 employees. Conclusions: the study contributed to the extension of the strategy-as-practice and innovation literature, by identifying SIS as an alternative in the planning process to enable innovation in the organization, in environments with a high rate of change and unpredictability.

The units of analysis were groups of employees and managers within the case organisation. The primary mechanisms identified were the mechanisms of organisational trust, innovation safety, organisational practices, cultural settings and the recognition and rewards structure to motivate employees.

However, existing studies have neglected to explore the evolutionary and development of cross-boundary innovation models from a process perspective. In particular, the induction and summary of the enterprise digital cross-boundary innovation path will provide guidance for the innovation and development of SEMs, which has become the core problem to be solved in this study. This study embeds dynamic capabilities into the evolution process of enterprise ecological niche. Through a qualitative study on the three cross-boundary processes of the digital publishing projects of traditional publishing enterprises under the background of digital transformation, it reveals the growth mechanism and evolution path of dynamic capability affecting enterprise niche change in the process of cross-boundary innovation of SMEs. The results show that:(1) Under the background of digital transformation, the niche structure of SMEs is influenced by technology factor, resource factor, demand factor, and network factor; (2) In the process of cross-boundary innovation, the coupling of enterprise multi-dimensional dynamic capability and niche factors drive the migration of enterprise niche; (3) The development path of cross-boundary innovation of SMEs is the process of niche dynamic adjustment, such as niche expansion, niche dislocation and niche construction. This research conclusion reveals the development law of cross-boundary innovation of SMEs, further enriches the research system of cross-boundary innovation and provides theoretical guidance for the digital transformation of SMEs and the implementation of cross-boundary development strategy.

The paper discusses the effect logistics 4.0 innovations have on Intellectual Property (IP) management. Logistics 4.0 has marked a new era and introduced a novel concept to both industry and service communities. New entrepreneurial ideas based on different technologies are introduced which enables the digital transformation of logistics. This transformation also impacts innovation and various IP processes and its management. The approach used in this paper is exploratory in nature. The case study methodology is followed. This paper will discuss various examples of digital applications. Then a case will be selected for the analysis and categorization of innovation and IP. The categorization will take place based on different logistics 4.0 definitions as well as with concepts related to the types of innovation provided by the Oslo Manual and the IP management implications that are generated. This study has a limitation concerning the empirical part. More empirical research and studies should be conducted concerning logistics 4.0, innovation and IP management context. The findings of the case study will act as a guiding path for the upcoming studies, senior officials, policymakers, managers, and business leaders. The paper provides a holistic background of logistics and the revolution of Logistic 4.0. It also discusses the impact it has on innovation and IP management. The results show some important elements that have to be considered in the digital transformation of logistics 4.0. The paper can be used as a base for future research in specific issues related to Innovation and IP management concerning Logistic 4.0. Copyright Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2021 by NaudÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Scribante.

Introduction to alternative pathways of thinking and actions in an organization is typically tie-up with innovation nowadays. In this regard, the degrees of organizations willingness to engage and perceive advantage from new products or services, or products or services that embody new technology are being focused. Since leadership has been identified as a key determinant of organization innovation, a conceptual framework is proposed to explore the impact of entrepreneurial leadership on organization demand for innovation. Apart from the leadership behaviors, followersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ characteristic and their own confidence level or perceived self-efficacy are also studied to capture the effect of innovative work behavior. Hence, this study aims to determine the moderating role of employeesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ innovative self-efficacy on the relationship between entrepreneurial leadership and organization demand for innovation. A sample from Malaysia Top 100 companies is participated and the hypotheses are evaluated using partial least squares analysis. This research makes a significant contribution by providing empirical evidence that support entrepreneurial leaders and the organizations to generate more opportunities and enact them in ways that increase the firmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s receptivity towards innovation.

This PDW is designed to address questions at the intersection of digital innovation and digital transformation. These topics are interrelated as successive waves of digital innovation within an industry or at the level of an individual firm and its ecosystem may lead to fundamental transformation of structures, roles and management, culture, competencies and skills, and so forth, depending on the influence of barriers such as inertia and resistance to change. By exploring how and why the new organizing logic of digital innovation impacts and transforms incumbent firms, the workshop addresses questions from four different areas: (1) Why the new logic of digital innovation triggers a digital transformation in incumbent firms; (2) the drivers of this digital transformation in incumbent firms' immediate environment; (3) how these drivers may under certain conditions alter the structure, strategy, culture, competencies, skills and technology platforms of incumbent firms; (4) the trajectories of digital transformation journeys inside incumbent firms.

We address two questions: (1) Which organizations play the regional gatekeeper role in innovation networks? (2) How are gatekeeper linkages affected by different kinds of proximity (geographical, institutional, cognitive and social)? The empirical analysis employs co-patenting data from Brazilian organizations. Universities and public research organizations are shown to be more likely to perform the regional gatekeeper role. Gatekeepers are able to overcome geographic and institutional distance. They also balance cognitive distance with other organizations when geographical or institutional proximities are present. Given their critical role in innovation networks, universities and other public research organizations deserve special attention in policies designed to foster technological upgrading and regional development.

Through the exploration of the use of sustainable, iterative circles in a manufacturing environment, this paper explores their role in facilitating customer-focused innovation practices. Other supporting antecedences for innovative behavior are reviewed, and their combined effect upon delivering cost-effective product developments are assessed. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected through semi-structured interviews in manufacturing organizations from the automotive industry. Interviews were conducted with senior functional managers to interpret the application of sustainable, iterative development circles. Analysis of the data was undertaken via thematic analysis based upon pertinent and emergent themes. Findings: Sustainable, iterative development circles overcame the inherent path-dependency of traditional linear development approaches, whereas, traditional approaches structure the involvement of key business functions, iterative circles facilitate more flexible approaches to product development that more closely met the requirements of the customer, especially when those requirements are in a state of flux. Practical implications: This iterative, customer-centric approach to product development reflects the increasingly dynamic market environments in which manufacturing organizations operate. Using this approach helps to focus the organizationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s attention upon customer requirements rather than the challenges of adhering to the rigid dogma of a chosen development methodology. Originality/value: This study proposes a new approach toward the development of innovations in manufacturing organizations utilizing the sustainable, iterative circles, and therefore, contrasts with the traditional, linear development methodologies that are usually employed.

Drawing from creativity research and strategic design methods, an agile approach to exploration of deep learning technology in the context of architectural optimisation was developed. The investigation proposed and defined the nature of a framework, which explored ways of integrating architectural shape design with machine intelligence. Furthermore, the paper elaborates the implications and potential for impact of deep learning techniques on advancing human-computer- interaction for architectural optimisation. However, the described framework might be used as a design scheme for an active tool to drive design processes and support decision-making in early stages of architectural design. The components of the framework defined interfaces and critical points of investigation for application of the presented methodology in creative practice. In this way the research contributes to the theoretical and methodological development of creative systems research. At its heart, this generative design study involved the definition of a clear research trajectory, challenges and opportunities of supporting creative practice by means of design systems. Finally, the potential of machine intelligence to generate creative work with and without human guidance or performance criteria was examined.

In this special issue editorial, we shed light on the current state of digital entrepreneurship and digital innovation research to take stock of past research and identify opportunities for the future. The 11 papers in this special issue present a decisive step in extending the current research by either exploring the context of digital entrepreneurship and digital innovation, by operationalizing digital technologies as moderators or mediators, or by modeling the particularities of the role of digital technologies as independent or dependent variables. This editorial suggests paths for future research and specifically calls for more joint consideration of digital entrepreneurship and digital innovation along with specific theory building and testing that incorporates the specificities of digitization. An important aspect in that process is extending the understanding of the dark side of digitization.

The adoption of collaborative research agreements (CRAs) or collaboration agreements (CAs) is rising rapidly as firms attempt to access innovation from various types of organizations to enhance their traditional in-house innovation [2], [3]. To achieve the objectives of their collaborations, firms need to share knowledge and jointly develop new knowledge. As more firms adopt open collaborative innovation strategies, intellectual property (IP) management has inevitably become important because clear and fair contractual IP terms and conditions such as IP ownership allocation, licensing arrangements and compensation for IP access are required for each collaborative project [4], [5]. Moreover, the firms need to adjust their IP management strategies to fit the unique characteristics and circumstances of each particular project [5].This paper addresses one of the challenges of open innovation - the issue of the right to access and exploit innovations owned by collaborative partners inside and outside the boundary of a research collaboration. Licensing is considered as a solution to the problems of managing knowledge shared between collaborators. To design appropriate IP licensing provisions in collaboration agreements with partners in complex research and technology projects, project managers need to configure a set of critical IP licensing elements based on consideration of a strategic set of contextual factors. Drawing inspiration especially from context-related studies that have recently become more prominent in the field of innovation management [5], [6], we adopt a contextual approach to analyze the influence of a variety of factors on decisions related to IP access and licensing solutions.Our literature review covers the topics of: (1) open innovation and collaborative innovation, (2) IP in collaborative innovation, (3) IP licensing in collaboration agreements, (4) contextualization, and (5) complex product systems. We view the two concepts of open innovation and collaborative innovation as similar, with the labels being generally interchangeable, but, for simplicity and clarity, we adopt the label ""collaborative innovation."" Collaborative innovation is arguably mandatory practice for firms seeking to maintain success in complex high-tech industries [1], [7]. However, collaborative innovation may be implemented differently depending on the inherent characteristics of each industry. Moreover, since complex products require engineeringintensive tasks and involve costly RD efforts, they contain valuable technologies associated with higher potential losses if the shared technologies are leaked or imitated [8]. IP rights are therefore crucial for complex goods when technology is shared. IP licensing is used for managing knowledge transfer, facilitating innovation developments and appropriating benefits from collaborative innovation [9], [10], [11]. The essential strategic considerations for IP licensing are exclusivity, cross-licensing, sublicensing, restrictions on market, mode of commercialization, field of application, geographical area, and time, royalties, technical assistance, future developments, taxes, and restraint of trade [4].For this preliminary paper we focus on only one form of IP rights - namely, patent rights - and, for practicability, assume uniformity of the pertinent aspects of patent law across jurisdictions. In subsequent research, these constraints may be relaxed. Our main focus is company-led research collaborations in complex technological industries, such as aerospace, defense, automotive, or offshore hydrocarbon recovery, or telecommunications, in which buyer-supplier collaborations are normal and extensive. We adopted a company-centric approach to analyze IP licensing terms in bilateral agreements between a company and its collaborator. A project manager of a particular company needs to decide whether or not to grant a license to its collaborator for accessing or exploiting its IP, whether or not to acquire a license for the company to access or exploit the collaborator's IP, and also what the scope of the licenses should be. Moreover, the company and the collaborator need to have a mutual agreement covering how to manage and exploit their jointly-owned IP.Our research methodology includes an inductive approach to theorizing and developing a conceptual framework for IP access and licensing solutions in an open collaborative project. It employs a set of critical IP licensing elements and a strategic set of contextual factors based on systematic literature review and analysis of professional expertise and experience of the authors, and extensive insights, notes, and interviews of project managers, IP managers, patent attorneys, paralegals, research contract managers, procurement managers, and engineers of an anonymous large-scale international complex product company. An exploratory qualitative research project, based on a case study of the IP strategies in collaborative innovation of that company, will be discussed in a subsequent paper.The results of this current paper include how our framework was developed and how it may be implemented in practice. We consider two types of knowledge - prior knowledge (background IP) and new knowledge developed within a collaborative project (foreground IP) - and the IP access issues that appear after the ownership of IP rights have been allocated or fully transferred. We do not consider here the complicated details of IP inventorship, IP ownership rights allocation or the transfer of IP ownership rights. The IP rights could be owned solely by either the Company or by the Collaborator, or jointly owned by the two parties. Thus, there are six categories of the IP in our consideration including: (1) Company background IP; (2) Company foreground IP; (3) Collaborator background IP; (4) Collaborator foreground IP; (5) Joint background IP; and (6) Joint foreground IP. The Company needs to make different decisions for each category of IP.The main IP licensing elements in our proposed framework consist of exclusivity, geographic scope, field of application, time frame, sub-licensing scope, and level of compensation. In addition, we have identified nine contextual factors as follows:(1)Participation of Collaborator in Company's activities outside the project boundary;(2)Centrality of the technology to the Company;(3)Ease of substituting Collaborator's technology (modules) in the project with other technologies of third parties;(4)Type of Collaborator based on market intents;(5)Type of Collaborator based on business purposes;(6)Number of collaborators in the project;(7)Share of financial investment in the project;(8)Involvement of any third party in the Company's activities that require the relevant Collaborator IP; and(9)Level of IP management capability of Company.Our proposed IP access and licensing solutions inside and outside the boundary of a collaborative project are drawn from our literature review. They will be tested and refined through future empirical research with large international companies in complex technological industries. The final decision regarding IP access and licensing solutions for each project may be reached by considering the combination of different solutions in particular categories of the contextual factors of a specific collaborative project. The project manager or IP manager may reach that decision by either a managerial judgment path or a quantitative scoring path.In conclusion, our proposed framework may act as a rubric to help project managers or IP managers make decisions about designing and configuring IP access and licensing solutions in any collaborative research project by answering the two main questions: (1) ""Does the Company need to grant a license to the Collaborator for using the Company background and foreground IP or not? If yes, what is the scope of the license?"" and (2) ""Does the Company need to acquire a license from the Collaborator for using the Collaborator background and foreground IP or not? If yes, what is the scope of the license?"" A set of critical IP access and licensing elements and a strategic set of contextual factors have been identified for this purpose. Each category of the contextual factors affects the decisions about background and foreground IP access and licensing solutions inside and outside the project boundary in different ways. As a result, we have demonstrated an example of how the framework can be implemented in practice, in which the final decisions can be made either by managerial judgment or quantitative scoring. In our future research, we plan to test and elaborate the framework by using empirical evidence from large international companies in complex technological industries. Ultimately, our framework may be applied to any complex technological organization that needs to manage IP in research collaborations associated with the development of complex technological products.

The methodological approach was an exploratory case study of a governmental client organisation within the Danish construction industry. The units of analysis were groups of employees and managers within the case organisation. The primary mechanisms identified were the mechanisms of organisational trust, innovation safety, organisational practices, cultural settings and the recognition and rewards structure to motivate employees. The decision-making procedures should be transparent especially to the idea-owners and the employees involved, and the implementation and putting into practice should be prioritised phases in the innovation process.

It is to a great extent driven by a large number of latecomers who effectively pursued the initial technological catch-up under the model of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsecondary innovationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â. However, how latecomers could get rid of the trap of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcatch-upÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âfall-behindÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âcatch-upÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â and cross towards ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbeyondÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â is a hot topic, gaining great concern in the field of both theory and practice. The existed literatures rarely discuss the innovation strategy in the late catch-up phase, especially in the period of paradigm shift. Besides, the technological, market and institutional environment in China have undergone tremendous changes, and latecomers located in the late catch-up phase have already accumulated a great amount of different resources and capabilities, compared with those located in the early catch-up stage. Therefore, it calls for scholars to systematically and deeply analyze the innovation mode and path of latecomers in the late catch-up period, in order to fill the research gap and provide better guidance to firms developing from catch-up to beyond. Based on the realistic and theoretical background, the first two sections of this paper review the general catch-up path of latecomers and the ""dynamic model of secondary innovation"" which is proposed from the context of China. It is different from the famous ""U-A model"" developed from western developed economies. Specifically, the ""dynamic model of secondary innovation"" emphasizes the importance of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwindow of opportunityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â in the period of technology paradigm shift for latecomers, and shows the whole developing process of secondary innovation based on the introduction of mature technology and emerging technology to independent innovation. This paper summarized the changes in strategic environment faced by Chinese enterprises in new era: the shortening lifecycle and the increase of uncertainty of technological development, the disappearance of demographic dividend and the emergence of talent dividend, the rapid rise of the middle class, and the transformation of institution from encouraging technology introduction to emphasizing the breakthrough of key technology as well as the layout of National Innovation System. Then in the fourth section, we critically re-examine the traditional strategic management theory in the new ""paradigm shift"" environment. The paper points out that the importance of paying attention to the power of the complementary, overcoming the inertia resources & abilities, and the existing path dependence, as well as paying more attention to the ""gray"" management based on the ""ambidextrous thinking"". Based on the systematic analysis of the current strategic environment and the in-depth thinking of the strategic management theory, the innovation strategy of ""Beyond catch-up"" in the process of nonlinear chaos is put forward. Specifically, ""Beyond catch-up"" refers to an innovation model in which an organization, with its own capability and the support from complementors, pays attention to ""gray"" management that emphasizes both ""exploitation"" and ""exploration"" in R&D, gets rid of the restriction of the existing technology paradigm, and seeks for revolutionary innovative development with a higher, broader and more forward-looking vision and layout in an open and changing context. On the basis of case analysis, the paper brings forward three main models of ""Beyond catch-up"", that is, the ""Beyond catch-up"" model led by technology innovation, led by business model innovation and the integrated models driven by both technology innovation and business model innovation. It is particularly worth mentioning that in the innovation strategy of ""Beyond catch-up"", the development of the innovation ability of latecomers is not only passively following the technological path determined by the technological paradigm of industry leaders, on the contrary, the cross-border innovation ability will promote the latecomers to develop the new technological paradigm in collaboration with business model innovation. During the paradigm shift in which technology, markets, and institutions have undergone tremendous changes, we should rethink the applicability of traditional theories, explore the characteristics and patterns of latecomersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ catch-up. The innovation strategy of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBeyond catch-upÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â is of great practical significance and theoretical value to guide more enterprises to correctly understand and grasp the important window of opportunity when the next paradigm emerges, realize the role transformation from follower to leader, and lead more enterprises and even the whole society to develop more sustainably and healthily.

This is also the case in the Chinese context (Cai, 2018). In recent years, the importance of non-research universities in regional development and innovation has been increasingly recognized (Taylor et al., 2008). Among a small volume of studies exploring the role of universities of applied science (UASs), or non research universities, in the process of regional innovation, a constant challenge has been that of applying appropriate theoretical or analytical frameworks. Currently, most studies in this field apply theoretical insights originally developed for under standing the relationship between research universities and regional innovation systems. The most commonly used frameworks are, for instance, the Triple Helix model (Etzkowitz, 2008; Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff, 1995, 1997) for analysing the UASs and industry links (Yang et al., 2016), and the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“five pathways to an entrepreneurial universityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ (Clark, 1998) for understanding the organizational responses of UASs to the emerging demands of regional development (Lyytinen, 2011).

A wide variety of digital technologies such as blockchain, 3D printing, cyber-physical systems, or big data also diverges the applications of digital technologies in circular business models. Given heterogeneous attributes of circular business models and digital technologies, the selections of digital technologies and circular business models might be highly distinctive within and between sectorial contexts. This paper examines digital circular business models in the context of the fashion industry and its multiple actors. This industry as the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s second polluting industry requires an urgent circular economy (CE) transition with less resource consumption, lower waste emissions and a more stable economy. Design/methodology/approach: An inductive, exploratory multiple-case study method is employed to investigate the ten cases of different sized fashion companies (i.e. large, small medium-sized firm (SME) and startup firms). The comparison across cases is conducted to understand fashion firms' distinct behaviours in adopting various digital circular economy strategies. Findings: The paper presents three archetypes of digital-based circular business models in the fashion industry: the blockchain-based supply chain model, the service-based model and the pull demand-driven model. Besides incremental innovations, the radical business model and digital innovations as presented in the pull demand-driven model may be crucial to the fashion circular economy transition. The pull demandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“driven model may shift the economy from scales to scopes, change the whole process of how the fashion items are forecasted, produced, and used, and reform consumer behaviours. The paths of adopting digital fashion circular business models are also different among large, SMEs and startup fashion firms. Practical implications: The study provides business managers with empirical insights on how circular business models (CBMs) should be chosen according to intrinsic business capacities, technological competences and CE strategies. The emerging trends of new fashion markets (e.g. rental, subscription) and consumers' sustainable awareness should be not be neglected. Moreover, besides adopting recycling and reuse strategies, large fashion incumbents consider collaborating with other technology suppliers and startup companies to incubate more radical innovations. Social implications: Appropriate policies and regulations should be enacted to enable the digital CE transition. Market patterns and consumer acceptances are considered highly challenging to these digital fashion models. A balanced policy on both the demand and supply sides are suggested. The one-side policy may fail CBMs that entail an upside-down collaboration of both producers and consumers. Moreover, it is perhaps time to rethink how to reduce unnecessary new demand rather than repeatedly producing and recycling. Originality/value: The pace of CE research is lagging far behind the accelerating environmental contamination by the fashion industry. The study aims to narrow the gap between theory and practice to harmonise fashion firms' orchestration and accelerate the transition of the fashion industry towards the CE. This study examines diverse types of digital technologies in different circular business models in a homogeneous context of the fashion industry with heterogeneous firm types.

The study used questionnaire data taken from 250 managers of banks in Pakistan. Structural equation modeling was used to test hypotheses. The results indicate that while the dimensions of organizational culture and innovation have a clear and positive influence on organizational performance, organizational culture and mission have an insignificant relationship with organizational performance in the presence of innovation. These results give organizations valuable insights to compete against environmental changes by effectively implementing innovations, especially in Pakistan's banking sector. The findings illustrate that mechanisms to boost an organization's innovative culture can enable the implementation of innovation, that in turn, can contribute to superior organizational performance. In extant literature, organizational culture has been examined as one of the factors that influences organizational performance. However, there is a lack of empirical studies on the relationship between organizational culture and organizational performance. Besides, as a factor of organizational performance, several investigators have considered innovation, but few have studied organizational innovation as being affected by organizational culture. This study explores the link between organizational culture, organizational performance and the role of innovation in this relationship.

First, we explore how concepts from the literatures of human dignity and humanistic management can inform and enrich social entrepreneurship and innovation. Second, we examine case studies of social entrepreneurship and innovation to refine how we think about and operationalize notions of human dignity. In this way, we connect human dignity research more closely to alternative life-conducive forms of organizing. Our goals are to advance an understanding of human dignity and to make this concept more accessible and relevant in business and management, as well as to explore how the practice of social entrepreneurship and innovation can both enrich and be enriched by the notion of human dignity. Third, we draw on the emerging literature of humanistic management to generate a classification system in the context of social innovation that specifies how organizing can contribute to dignity restoration, dignity protection, and dignity promotion. We elaborate and showcase paradigmatic cases, probe the limits of these cases for future research, and consider how to extend this dignity organizing model to other modes of business practice, such as the notion of value creation. Fourth, we outline an emerging research agenda for those interested in connecting innovation and organizing practices writ large with the notion of human dignity.

In Asia, Malaysia as an Islamic country is one of the early adopters with a high level of awareness on cryptocurrency. This paper aims to investigate the factors affecting the investment decision in cryptocurrency among potential investors in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: Data was collected from 200 individuals aged 18 years and over. The hypotheses were tested using the partial least squares ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ structural equation modeling technique. Findings: Results showed that attitude toward risk and perceived behavioral control have a significant positive effect on the investorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s investment decision in cryptocurrency. Interestingly, machine learning forecasting enhances the relationship between perceived benefits and the investment decision in cryptocurrency. Practical implications: Results benefit investors and practitioners on the significant determinants of investment decision in cryptocurrency in emerging market. Originality/value: Despite having high volatility and complexity in price determination, and being decentralized, cryptocurrency has managed to attract many investors due to reasons less explored. The outcome of this study extends the theory of planned behavior and confirms the role of machine learning forecasting as a moderator in the context of cryptocurrency investment.

Design/methodology/approach This study is based on empirical data collected from a survey of 210 companies and their supply chains in mainland China. Structural equation modeling is used to test the proposed relationships. Findings The findings show that SCF significantly mitigates the SCR, which subsequently has a significant positive effect on OP (e.g. operational risk and operational performance). The findings also show that when ED is high, the relationship between SCF and SCR is stronger and vice versa. Moreover, SCR mediates the relationship between SCF and OP. The hypothesis regarding the moderating effect of ED on the paths joining SCF and SCR was also supported. SCR has a significant negative effect on OP. However, the hypothesis regarding the effect of ED on SCR was not supported. Research limitations/implications This study has some limitations. First, this paper conducted the research with Chinese organizations. This may result in low generalizability in other contexts. In addition, this paper used the survey method and cross-sectional data design in this study, which may generate the potential issue of common method bias. However, the findings of this study will help organizations across China and other emerging economies to adopt SCF as a secure financing mechanism to enhance working capital and mitigate risk. In addition, the paper provides some new managerial insights for decision-makers in organizations, while exploring different factors such as SCF, SCR and ED and their effect on the organization. Originality/value This study has greatly developed a general SCF adoption model that helps to guide empirical research investigating the critical impact of SCF on firm performance.",2022,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/SCM-05-2020-0223,C1,4,2022,Journal,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.158084856,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.125462918,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.01739283,0,0.06345053,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.173390416,0,0.172839677,0,0,0,0.253384975,0,0.16493057,0.142008943,0,0,0.385666896,0.14121093,0,0.171205834,0,0.082828422,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.188357067,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.3078488,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.094671008,0,0,0.073451657,0.421856945,0,0,0.472841226,0,0.154378025,0,0,0,0.092715824,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1,,,1,,,,,51

Yet, comprehensive research on SSP adoption by these companies, such as the handicraft organizations in Vietnam, is scarce. To supplement the inadequacy, this study takes an integrated supply chain perspective to examine holistically the critical factors affecting SSP adoption by Vietnamese handicraft organizations. Data were collected from a countrywide survey of 310 handicraft organizations with SSP adoption in Vietnam. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was employed to test the hypotheses. The findings reveal that organizational behavior and readiness impact directly on SSP adoption, whereas stakeholder pressures show some indirect impacts. The results also validate the mediating roles of organizational behavior and readiness in the adoption of SSP. By combining the technology-organization-environment framework with the institutional theory, this study successfully explains the diverse SSP adoption behaviors in Vietnamese handicraft organizations. It is the first attempt to explore the critical role of internationalization readiness in SSP adoption in the Vietnamese context. The research outcomes provide insights and references for sustainability practitioners and policymakers to promote SSP adoption that extends across the entire supply chain.

The purpose of this study was to explore the dynamic information transfer mechanism in CPNs by simulation method and promote the efficiency and effectiveness of information transfer through network structure adjustment. The collaborative project network information transfer (CPNIT) model was established based on the theories of information theory, agent-based modeling, and social network analysis. The key part of the model is the rules system, which includes four sets: the rules of information dissemination, information absorption, efficiency and effectiveness evaluation, and network structure adjustment strategies. A case study was conducted, including parallel simulation experiments with three scenarios of adjustment strategies. The results showed that the model can accurately present the dynamic processes of information transfer in CPNs, and the structure adjustments were demonstrated to have great effect on the efficiency and effectiveness of information transfer. This study developed the theory of information transfer in collaborative projects from the network perspective and determined the dynamic mechanism of information transfer.

Knowledge Management research can help to identify and develop behaviors and practices that stimulate and leverage green knowledge, which aims to improve organizations' eco-innovator performance. We argue that this green knowledge base supports the search for practices and strategies of sustainability and forms the foundation for the development of greener performance trajectories. The purpose of this paper is the identification of a green knowledge foundation that supports and put into practice the eco-innovation potential of organizations. To the best of our knowledge, the literature revision shows very limited studies in this field. While the literature that explores the relationship between innovation and knowledge management is abundant, the same is not true when it goes beyond products/processes/practices towards a broader societal context including sustainability issues. We aim to develop a framework which comes up from the identification of eco-innovation dimensions and knowledge management practices. This framework aims to be a knowledge base that integrates the sustainability problematic. This paper follows a theoretical, deductive approach towards green knowledge of corporate sustainability with an emphasis on eco-innovation. We argue that connecting these two fields opens up mutual research and practice perspectives.",2016,Conference Paper,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84996635658&partnerID=40&md5=1080b2f70811b5b766f21284d5c81a3a,C10,1,2021,Journal,0,0.097306383,0,0,0,0.204904522,0.097597235,0,0,0.165835677,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.100929314,0.082689665,0,0,0,0,0,0.039172609,0.089429136,0.089684324,0,0,0.073418931,0,0,0,0,0,0.086691057,0.210069104,0.173814337,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.098027009,0.051135986,0,0,0,0.254324894,0,0,0,0.072835817,0,0,0,0.058143232,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.019983549,0,0,0.778664952,0.091765628,0,0,0,0.058447272,0,0,0.09069406,0.052088571,0.072297974,0.162545726,0,0.077876461,0,0,0,0,0,0.127397139,0.119047279,0,0,0,0.080454156,0,1,,,1,,,1,,,,,51

In light of this, this study aims to explore the influence of supply chain knowledge, non-supply chain learning and corporate reputation on green innovation. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a quantitative research approach where data is gathered from managers of 208 small and medium enterprises in Ghana using survey questionnaires. The structural equation modeling is used to analyze the survey data. Findings: The findings reveal supply chain knowledge relates positively with non-supply chain learning, corporate reputation and green innovation. Corporate reputation also impacts green innovation positively and provides partial mediation effect between supply chain knowledge and green innovation. Meanwhile, non-supply chain learning does not relate positively with green innovation as well as fails to mediate the impact of supply chain knowledge on green innovation. Originality/value: This study contributes to knowledge in the mediating mechanisms of corporate reputation and non-supply chain learning between supply chain knowledge and green innovation. Through this, the authors propose a theoretical model to explain how firms can leverage supply chain knowledge, corporate reputation and non-supply chain learning to improve green innovation and can serve as the basis for further theoretical and empirical research in innovation and external sources of knowledge.

In this regard, the capacity to leverage and unleash the potential of big data tools and techniques is one of various significant components of successfully steering CI and ultimately infusing such valuable knowledge into CI strategies. In this paper, the authors aim to examine Big Data applications in CI processes within organizations by exploring how organizations deal with Big Data analytics, and this study provides a context for developing Big Data frameworks and process models for CI in organizations. Overall, research findings have indicated a preference for a rather centralized informal process as opposed to a clear formal structure for CI; the use of basic tools for queries, as opposed to reliance on dedicated methods such as advanced machine learning; and the existence of multiple challenges that companies currently face regarding the use of big data analytics in building organizational CI.",2021,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102231,C14,9,2016,Journal,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.133276134,0,0,0.113230348,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.11291876,0,0,0,0,0,0.053493052,0,0,0,0,0.300776694,0,0,0,0,0,0.118382953,0,0.023735614,0,0,0.119723061,0.064649378,0,0,0.119050283,0,0,0.066931511,0,0,0.183792618,0,0,0.097892759,0,0.110166247,0,0,0.123524839,0,0.079398819,0.175796459,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.049941414,0.027288992,0,0,0.075951694,0,0,0,0,0.159628016,0.064996388,0.123524839,0,0.071130738,0.098728149,0.073989343,0.132878953,0,0,0.113230348,0.036475054,0,0.078165656,0,0,0,0,0,0.76906207,0,1,,,1,,,1,,,,,51

Design/methodology/approach A qualitative case study approach has been adopted as a methodology to conduct the research. Six Italian innovative start-ups were selected and analyzed through in-depth interviews with founders and data collection to understand whether and how start-ups adopt exploration and exploitation solutions to face critical events in their business lives. Findings The most evident result of this study is that start-ups adopt more frequently a temporal separation of exploration and exploitation activities as the preferred mode for balancing learning and innovation tension. They do not seem to exhibit a defined or a common path in the way they realize the temporal separation between exploration and exploitation. Instead, they mostly oscillate. The ambidextrous solution is selected in only a few cases and not consecutively. The pre-entry knowledge profile seems to influence the choice of start-ups at the beginning of their lives. Practical implications - This research has implications for the whole start-up's ecosystem, comprising incubators/accelerators, advisors, intermediaries, venture capitalists, new venture founders and policymakers. For example, by knowing the typology of knowledge and competence gaps start-ups usually aim to fill when they face particular events, intermediaries (such as incubators) could better plan initiatives and strategies supporting new ventures in the process of growth and stabilization. Furthermore, the venture capitalists can benefit from this research, by planning specific interventions for each critical event based on specific resources and competencies gaps and guiding for more promising start-ups. Originality/value This paper presents a novel application of entrepreneurial learning approach in the context of new venture creation. To reach this aim, a classification of exploration/exploitation solutions has been developed.",2019,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJEBR-12-2018-0817,C9,1,2017,Journal,0.160229845,0,0,0,0,0.079374683,0,0,0.036678362,0,0,0,0,0.08319895,0.052825349,0,0,0.039097392,0,0.470433492,0,0,0.024957392,0,0.0303489,0,0,0,0.078405582,0.227524676,0,0,0.064954297,0,0,0,0,0.053864923,0,0,0,0.110035087,0,0.491913565,0.067542327,0,0,0,0,0,0.052136714,0,0.065679233,0.055538757,0.063189655,0.062502032,0,0.225231762,0.070080934,0,0.045046352,0.099736864,0,0,0,0.037771573,0,0,0,0,0,0.015482214,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.045281907,0.110625709,0.070080934,0.03513252,0.080711032,0.084019065,0,0.301551697,0,0,0,0,0,0.443467263,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1,,,1,,,,,51

Crowdsourcing-defined as the usage of a flexible open call to a heterogeneous group of individuals to recruit volunteers for a task -is an emerging scientific model that encourages larger and more outwardly transparent collaborations. While crowdsourcing, particularly through citizen- or community-based science, has been increasing over the last decade in ecological research, it remains infrequently used as a means of generating scientific knowledge in comparison to more traditional approaches. We explored a new implementation of crowdsourcing by using an open call on social media to assess its utility to address fundamental ecological questions. We specifically focused on pervasive challenges in predicting, mitigating, and understanding the consequences of disturbances. In this paper, we briefly review open science concepts and their benefits, and then focus on the new methods we used to generate a scientific publication. We share our approach, lessons learned, and potential pathways forward for expanding open science. Our model is based on the beliefs that social media can be a powerful tool for idea generation and that open collaborative writing processes can enhance scientific outcomes. We structured the project in five phases: (1) draft idea generation, (2) leadership team recruitment and project development, (3) open collaborator recruitment via social media, (4) iterative paper development, and (5) final editing, authorship assignment, and submission by the leadership team. We observed benefits including: facilitating connections between unusual networks of scientists, providing opportunities for early career and underrepresented groups of scientists, and rapid knowledge exchange that generated multidisciplinary ideas. We also identified areas for improvement, highlighting biases in the individuals that self-selected participation and acknowledging remaining barriers to contributing new or incompletely formed ideas into a public document.

We studied a firm, which was producing and launching digital platforms for managing organizational operations. Drawing on a case study of developing this digital platform, we identified three recurring calculative and narrative practices: ideating; concocting; aligning. We argue that through these practices various epistemic objects (which we call 'learning catalogue') were enacted representing the emerging consensus of the usage and market potential for the digital innovation under development, and simultaneously enabling actors to create new knowledge of what was not known. This dynamic learning catalogue represented the constantly evolving implicit business model for value generation. We offer significant contributions to business model studies in the context of digital innovation projects, and implications for the transformation of the contextual and technical uncertainty into calculable risk.

Whereas rapid manufacturing and rapid prototyping are well known fields of application, AM-based spare part production or AM-based co-creation have a rather visionary character. Nevertheless, companies have started using AM along the product life cycle from the generation of a product idea, through series production to the supply of spare parts. The findings of the explorative study offer insights into existing and emerging AM-based application fields. Moreover, it gives an overview about the benefits and challenges of implementing those into existing structures in companies in the industrial sector. It is apparent that AM is a complementary manufacturing technology in industrial production. However, the results of this exploration show that uncertencies remain in emerging application fields.

We argue that dynamic capabilities theory provides an insightful approach to understanding the internationalization of emerging market multinationals and their strategic choices. Drawing on dynamic capability theory and unpacking dynamic capabilities into four distinct but related dimensions or facets, we develop a typology of three internationalization strategies available to emerging market multinationals in their international expansion: sequential international ambidexterity (from exploitation to exploration, and vice versa) and structural international ambidexterity (simultaneous exploration and exploitation). Success factors associated with each of the ambidextrous internationalization strategies are also considered.

An enabler for its diffusion is knowledge integration (KI). This research investigates KI mechanisms used by a Concrete Reinforcement Supplier and its customers in the diffusion of BIM and BIM-related solutions. The research employs a qualitative approach with multiple data-collection methods at two different points in time. BIM diffusion and KI are viewed here as emergent and iterative processes, understood from a supplier perspective. The research examines the interaction between context, content of the diffusing innovation and the diffusion process. Knowledge development from the KI process has been assessed by exploring the interaction between (1) domain-specific knowledge, (2) procedural knowledge and (3) general knowledge, complementing the established emphasis on tacit and explicit knowledge found in relevant construction management research. The findings indicate that general knowledge needs to be high for increased BIM diffusion and the research raises the need to develop procedural knowledge both from a practical and research perspective.

Often people think of artificial intelligence substituting humans, but huge value is going to come from the new goods, services and innovations artificial intelligence will enable. The 4th Industrial Revolution; the Internet of Things; smart everything, from wearables to cities; and artificial intelligence are future waves that will change forever the world as we know it today. We tend to think that future ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsmartnessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â is only possible through the creative abilities that humans have. But as machines are entering the workplace and our daily lives, not only as static robots on a manufacturing line, but as intelligent systems with the potential to replace lawyers and accountants, doctors and teachers, companions and partners, their role in innovation in complex environments need to be explored. Already, governments are considering introducing new systems for protecting intellectual property that is generated by a non-human entity. This means that the notion of innovation, which up to now has been an attribute of humans only, will have to be redefined to accommodate these new innovators of the cyber world. The evolution of innovation from a human-only initiative, to human-machine co-innovation, to autonomous machine innovation is explored in this paper. An analysis is done on the maturity of machine intelligence and human-machine relationships, to investigate the potential of machines becoming autonomous innovators. Innovation is dependent on the ability to recognise patterns, combine and integrate existing properties and knowledge to represent something that is perceived as new by the user, filling a gap in the market. This is exactly what machines are taught to do and teach themselves to do better in a conceptualisation era that follows the knowledge economy and takes us along into the algorithm economy. This paper presents a mind model to facilitate a better understanding of future innovation systems in the context of the complexity of the future digital world. It introduces a discussion, that should continue, on how individual innovation, enterprise innovation and community-based innovation may be supported by machine innovation and how national systems of innovation could well be replaced by a global machine innovation network in the future.

The hypothesis of different paths of OI implementation is shaped across three theoretical dimensions: (1) the combination of open innovation approaches (the choice of the governance mode); (2) the type of knowledge exchanged (scientific knowledge, technological knowledge, product/ market knowledge); and (3) the sectoral innovation system to which the company belongs (characterized by different technological opportunities, innovation sources, and appropriability regimes). A multiple case study design has been adopted in order to investigate how and why the process of OI implementation in SMEs may be bounded by ""hidden costs"" hampering effectiveness. The study delivers four different paths of OI implementation (scienceoriented, technology-driven, application-oriented, and communitydriven) and demonstrates that SMEs in each path differently seek opportunities and face different risks.

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from the relevant stakeholders of the industry-university collaboration teams with a structured survey questionnaire. Working with 304 textile and apparel industry respondents, structural equation modeling based partial least square (PLS-SEM) is used to test the conceptual framework. PLS-SEM technique was applied to test the hypothesis using Smart-PLS 3.8 packages program. Findings: The results proposed TL has a positive impact on KMC and RI. Furthermore, the study reveals KMC positively mediated the relationship between TL and RI. This mediation is conditional on the moderating role of CI for the KMC (knowledge acquisition capabilityÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â +Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â knowledge-sharing capability) path to RI. Conversely, moderation of CI is insignificant and does not influence on fostering RI. Practical implications: Leaders and managers have realized creative and innovative culture is built within the organizations by leader-follower collaboration through actual knowledge acquisition and knowledge sharing. Moreover, industry policymakers and practitioners establish the knowledge management department to enhance the innovation culture among the firms' stakeholders to encourage RI to sustain the global business market. Originality/value: The study has introduced KMC as a mediator and CI as a moderator in the proposed model between TL-RI and KMC-RI. Further, it explores the linkages between TL, KMC, CI and RI.

Design/methodology/approach - The framework adopted assumed that for employees from both public and private sectors a range of factors contributes to a configurational effect. These factors-that can shift their behaviour towards being or becoming an intrapreneur-are the novelty of entrepreneurship, opportunities for permanent learning, the possibility of creating value for others and personal motivation. Findings - Four possible combinations of antecedent conditions that could lead to the expected outcome (being or becoming an entrepreneurial employee/intrapreneur) are consistent with the proposed model. Using a quantitative approach was appropriate for examining contrasting entrepreneurial intentions, specifically in identifying the profiles of the employees who might bring the company to the next level: information that could be useful to all managers. Research limitations/implications - Due to the exploratory nature of the research, with descriptive statistics, the correlations focused solely on the respondents' demographical characteristics.

To explore the influence of innovation mechanism and process on the industrial innovation capability, a theory model is proposed, in which the innovation mechanism is divided into three parts consisting of forcing mechanism, management mechanism and learning mechanism, and the innovation process being divided into three phases including accumulation process, transformation process and diffusion process. The innovation capability is evaluated from input, output and collaboration side. Further/empirical tests are conducted to support the analytical model, adopting the method of questionnaire survey and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The findings show that the forcing mechanism plays the dominant role in stimulating innovation input, the management mechanism mainly supports the industry innovation for China's automotive industry, and the learning mechanism is a long-term process, which could promote innovation inputs fundamentally. Innovation process considered, the accumulating process contributes most to the effective organizing and collaborating of automotive industry, the transforming process is the core element of industry innovation, which is the necessary condition for high quality innovation input and output.

They face global competition, are under-resourced, and suffer from weaker institutional support. It is suggested that to innovate successfully in this context, indigenous firms would benefit from focusing on managing their current knowledge base more efficiently. We know little about how knowledge management works outside developed economies and which knowledge governance mechanisms have more influence than others in the context of emerging economies. To address this gap, we explore how context may matter for the use of knowledge governance mechanisms and their effect on innovation performance in Brazilian firms. Using the survey data of 109 firms, structural equation modelling, and cluster analysis, our findings suggest that the joint application of knowledge-focused rewards, organizational design, and information and communication technologies that support knowledge processes is critical for boosting innovation performance. We discuss how the peculiarities of the Brazilian context may shape these findings. Our article contributes to the knowledge management and innovation literature by demonstrating that the joint effects of bundles of knowledge governance mechanisms and contextual variables should be explored in order to understand their impact on organizational outcomes.

However, to date, no studies have determined how combining or balancing the two strategic marketing foci may improve new product performance outcomes. This is an important issue in emerging markets, which have considerable potential to introduce new products, given the rising affordability and intense competition between Western and local firms. These challenges compel managers to offer new products and solutions in these markets. However, firms may adopt different strategic marketing foci for new product development. Using Pakistan as an emerging-market context, this paper aims to provide novel insights into how managers can choose the right balance of a customer-driving versus customer-driven strategy to optimise new-product performance. Design/methodology/approach A multi-industry approach surveyed senior strategy managers (N = 106) of Pakistani businesses. Findings Using polynomial regression and surface test analyses, the findings showed that balancing the two strategies influenced new-product performance more than either strategy alone. Surprisingly, the imbalance of greater customer-driving over customer-driven strategy or vice versa did not improve new-product performance. Moreover, new-product performance was greater when the level of balance was higher compared to when it was lower. Originality/value Grounded in behavioural and strategic adaptation theory, this study extends ambidexterity's theoretical foundations in marketing by empirically determining the optimal balance of an orientation and performance implication model. The findings can assist emerging market managers in choosing the right balance and combination of the two strategies for better performance of new products.",2021,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JBIM-01-2020-0003,C8,3,2017,Article,0.131946172,0,0,0,0,0.065363513,0,0,0.03020392,0,0,0,0,0.068512723,0.043500651,0,0,0.032195944,0,0.387392862,0,0,0.020551929,0,0.024991731,0,0,0,0.064565477,0.18736216,0,0,0.053488604,0,0,0,0,0.04435672,0,0,0,0.090611761,0,0.405081286,0.111239594,0,0,0,0,0,0.042933573,0,0.054085575,0.04573509,0.052035456,0.051469212,0,0.18547399,0.057710291,0,0.037094798,0.082131374,0,0,0,0.031104158,0,0,0,0,0,0.012749303,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.037288773,0.091098127,0.057710291,0.028930949,0.06646397,0.069188071,0,0.248321977,0,0,0,0,0,0.365186695,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.559105526,1,,,1,,,1,,,,,51

Online communities form the basis for civic platforms, which are incubators for new ideas through peer-to-peer networks, stakeholder mobilization and collaborative and partnership engagement. Digital data analytics offers unprecedented opportunities to build capacity within communities simply because online platforms serve as acquisition hubs of structured and unstructured data. Notwithstanding, technology powered forms of engagement face multiple design and management challenges. Currently, limited research is being conducted into the online community using digital data analytics in non-business contexts. This explorative study further develops existing knowledge on civic tech communities and the use of digital data analytics. To this end, we review the previous research in order to understand how to aggregate literature on online communities, civic technologies and data analytics into a conceptual model that is useable by both academics and practitioners. The framework proposed serves as the first step in differentiating the building blocks of relevant digital data in managing civic technology communities and should be regarded as an effort to structure the available sources. Thus, the focus of the proposed conceptual model is not to offer prescriptive guidelines on the use of digital analytics, but rather to present a broader understanding of the emerging phenomenon and dimensions of data analysis.

It focuses on IBM's transition from market leadership in a failed path (plasma) to leadership in the emerging dominant technology (LCD) in the 1980s. Interviews and internal documents offer two primary factors explaining renewal at IBM. First, IBM Research had a hybrid structure that captured the benefits of both centralized and decentralized R&D. Second, middle managers shaped senior management cognitive frames to focus on business-related issues instead of specific technical issues, thus bypassing biases often resulting from failure. The study offers an integrated framework on what facilitates flexibility at the technology, organization, and decision-making levels. This flexibility helps firms survive a turbulent era of ferment.Managerial summary: Firms facing technological uncertainty may need to recover from unlucky bets. But responding to failure is politically and organizationally difficult. This study explores how IBM recovered from its failed bet on plasma displays to lead the LCD display market. This study identifies six key factors, highlighting two. First, IBM's researchers received centralized funding, but could also receive funding directly from division managers. This structure helped preserve options and variety. Second, internal LCD champions focused on the business case for displays and not technology. This fostered technology agnosticism and helped avoid managerial biases from failure. For managers looking to use real options to maintain flexibility in an uncertain environment, this study offers clear suggestions related to design and decision making that can foster flexibility.

The model incorporates three essential characteristics of knowledge that have not been covered entirely by previous diffusion models: the network character of knowledge, compatibility of new knowledge with already existing knowledge, and the fact that transmission of knowledge requires some form of attention. We employ a network-of-networks approach, where agents are located within an innovation network and each agent itself contains another network composed of knowledge units (KUs). Since social learning is a path-dependent process, in our model, KUs are exchanged among agents and integrated into their respective knowledge networks depending on the received KUsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ compatibility with the currently focused ones. Thereby, we are also able to endogenize attributes such as absorptive capacity that have been treated as an exogenous parameter in some of the previous diffusion models. We use our model to simulate and analyze various scenarios, including cases for different degrees of knowledge diversity and cognitive distance among agents as well as knowledge exploitation versus exploration strategies. Here, the model is able to distinguish between two levels of knowledge diversity: heterogeneity within and between agents. Additionally, our simulation results give fresh impetus to debates about the interplay of innovation network structure and knowledge diffusion. In summary, our article proposes a novel way of modeling knowledge diffusion, thereby contributing to an advancement of the economics of innovation and knowledge.

The authors further examine the role of the decision-making approach on the RBV-prior-current performance paradigm. Using China as the research setting, they empirically test the theoretical model based on 229 firms selected from a nation-wide survey. Design/methodology/approach This study has used China as the research setting. The authors empirically test the theoretical model based on 229 firms selected from a nation-wide survey. Findings This study reveals that prior export performance is a key determinant of current export performance, and this effect is enhanced by product certification (an internal RBV mechanism) and the intention to make an initial public offering (and external RBV mechanism). Moreover, the internal RBV-prior-current performance paradigm is positively moderated by the delegated decision-making approach, while the external RBV-prior-current performance paradigm is negatively moderated by this decision-making approach. Research limitations/implications - The results related to RBV and prior organisational learning also extends the extant literature and offer implications in two important ways. One, this research advances existing research that has only considered the direct effect of organisational learning on current performance (Lages et al., 2008). In addition to its direct effect, this study suggests that the interplay of organisational learning and resource commitment also provides important determinants of export performance. These new results imply that future research should not only explore the effect of organisational learning theory but also that of firm resource in the research on the prior-current performance dyad (Lages et al., 2008). Two, this study also advances the theoretical development of the export venture resource and management commitment research by revealing two new factors (Cavusgil and Zou, 1994). As a result, when conducting exporting activity from an emerging economy, exporting firms should consider committing their resources on acquiring international certification and seeking external funding. These new findings provide new guidance on the choice of the type of resource commitments and their roles in the prior-current performance conceptualisation when operating in the emerging markets. Practical implications - The results also contribute to the conceptualisation of the decision-making literature in the context of emerging economies (Garnier, 1982; Kao, 1993; Redding, 1993; Solberg, 2000), where an owner decision- making approach is associated with a number of negative effects (Kao, 1993; Redding, 1993). This study suggests that an owner decision-making approach can actually help firms to implement the effect of external RBV's influence in the prior-current performance framework. As a result, the findings imply that researchers and managers of EMEFs should now consider including the effect of decision-making governance when exploring the interactive effect of RBV and organisational learning in export performance research (Lages et al., 2008). Originality/value - This three-way interaction results have implications for the development of organisational learning theory, the RBV, decision-making, export performance and emerging market literature.",2019,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EJM-08-2017-0496,C3,4,2019,Article,0,0,0,0,0.115610243,0,0,0.185458834,0,0,0.160789553,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.174304042,0.142804327,0,0,0,0.01854418,0,0.067650753,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.552843341,0,0.149714696,0,0,0,0,0.151409483,0.081759761,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.100412853,0,0,0.100412853,0,0,0,0,0.168393276,0.183116553,0,0,0,0.063159124,0.034511414,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.082198613,0,0.078313924,0.089956507,0.187286951,0,0.168047271,0,0,0,0,0,0.098853316,0,0,0,0,0,0.277887245,0.504485662,1,,,1,,,1,,,,,51

The innovative capability of organizations depends undoubtedly on how successful they are in the generation of knowledge, either via external acquisition or internal creation, and how organizational culture, management support and human capital factors are significant. Design/methodology/approach: To validate this phenomenon, a quantitative explanatory study was designed. Data collection was carried out through a questionnaire completed by 211 respondent of firms located in Mexico. During data analysis, structural equation modeling was implemented with the support of SmartPLS 3.0 to understand the moderating role of organizational factors and human capital between knowledge support system and innovativeness. Findings: The findings show that it is fundamental to build theories grounded in the particular realities of Latin American countries. For instance, these results suggest that there are two paths of innovation in Mexico in which organizational and human factors play key but differentiated roles. On the one hand, organizational culture, top management support, commitment and openness to innovation are essential to building and maintaining a knowledge support system that enables innovation. Additionally, promoting people-oriented organizations is key to innovation. Human capital factors, such as collaborators' motivation, professional skills and the opportunity to learn, intensify the knowledge support system and innovative capability. Research limitations/implications: The main limitations of the study are that only Mexican firms have been analyzed, and it is not possible to generalize the results to other contexts. Additionally, we have not identified whether the organizations that participated in the study originated in Mexico or are global enterprises that operate in Mexico. It could be significant to analyze whether multinationals from other countries that are operating in Mexico are more committed to learning to innovate than Mexican firms and the differences in their knowledge generation activities. Practical implications: The results of this study invite: (1) Managers to develop strategic initiatives that systematically promote knowledge generation activities identifying external and internal activities that allow them to build and maintain a knowledge support system, (2) Organizations to promote collaborative spaces in which employees can work in teams and strengthen their social ties, identifying communication physical and virtual spaces to share new ideas, seek new ways of doing things, and explore new processes and activities. This process will be significant in a culture where resistance to change predefines how knowledge translates into innovation. Social implications: The improvement of collaborators skills must be accompanied by other policies to enhance the innovation and business environment including the modernization and expansion of infrastructure. It is fundamental that governments firms and universities jointly develop a research agenda that will lead to the identification of significant issues and the effectiveness of solutions to foster innovation in Mexico. Only a holistic approach is likely to help the country move up the value chain and become a knowledge economy. In fact innovation is seen as a social process of public sector organizations that promote knowledge infrastructure such as universities and the government agencies that produce knowledge. Originality/value: These results suggest that there are two paths of innovation in Mexico in which organizational and human factors play a key but differentiated role. In Mexican firms, innovative capability is possible due to knowledge support systems built on organizational factors, and human capital factors, such as professional skills and motivation for opportunities to learn which intensify innovation.

Data were factor analysed, and path estimates determined using partial least squares structural equation modelling to test the hypotheses. Findings: The results reveal that each social capital (SC) facet has direct benefits for both exploratory and exploitative innovation. The findings also show a mix of full and partial mediation paths between the facets of SC and innovation types through AC. Originality/value: Extant research linking SC facets with innovation categories is fragmented. Added to this fragmentation is the dearth of studies linking both intra-firm and inter-firm SC with exploratory and exploitative innovation in firms. This paper makes a novel contribution by testing a model of the direct and indirect links (through AC) between internal and external SC and both exploratory and exploitative innovation in the context of construction contractor firms. The findings show how both facets of SC are necessary for exploratory and exploitative innovation. It reveals the types of relationships and capabilities necessary for specific innovation objectives.

Findings: The results show that ethical leadership is an important predictor of both individual and organizational creativity. For the individual level, the results of multilevel modeling indicate that there is a positive link between ethical leadership and employee creativity. Furthermore, ethical leadership affects employee creativity through knowledge sharing and psychological empowerment. At the organizational level, the results reveal that ethical leadership is positively associated with organizational innovation directly.

This study was conducted to explore the adoption of social networking applications in public and private sector universities. This paper aims to discover how social networking applications can foster knowledge sharing practices among employees of universities. Design/methodology/approach The study is based on an interpretivist, qualitative research design using grounded theory. Fifty-two semi-structured and non-directive interviews were undertaken with employees of public and private sector universities. Participants were selected using purposive sampling, and thematic analysis was performed using the NVivo 11-Plus. Findings The study highlights how social media networking applications can be used effectively and efficiently to foster knowledge sharing practices in the workplace. Five emerging themes are identified as follows. Social media networking tools can enhance new knowledge, increase employee skills, promote a knowledge sharing culture, foster effective communication and increase employee involvement in research activities. Originality/value A brief systematic literature review on social media and knowledge sharing highlights that only 11 per cent of studies found that examined the link between social media and knowledge sharing practices across the world. The study therefore represents an effort to shed new light on the adoption of social networking tools in the context of knowledge sharing among universities employees. Social media applications have become popular across the world, and the speed of their uptake is evolving rapidly. However, their contribution toward organizational change is not yet known.",2019,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/VJIKMS-01-2019-0001,C1,8,2021,Article,0,0,0,0,0.063356828,0,0,0,0.089612114,0.156951408,0,0.09264529,0,0,0,0,0,0.047761128,0.078259754,0,0.081816927,0.078910068,0,0.164555127,0,0,0,0,0.095779766,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.099407565,0,0.170731618,0.096368623,0,0.044806057,0,0.375574076,0,0,0,0.278326306,0,0,0.063689882,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.110056682,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.046141516,0,0,0,0,0.069225039,0.037825952,0,0,0.157917804,0.086849493,0.085122233,0,0,0,0,0,0.042917666,0,0.034212387,0,0.184186829,0.073704407,0,0.706281335,0.050558982,0.087860469,0,0,0,0,0,0.088372747,0,0.06911717,1,,,1,,,1,,,,,51

With increasing dissemination, AM confronts logistics service providers (LSPs) with the question of how they should adapt their business model to the threats and opportunities that come with the emerging digital technologies. We structure the AM activities of LSPs and develop a deep understanding of their resulting business model dynamics. For this exploratory purpose, this study develops a taxonomy and performs a cluster analysis to present six clusters of how LSPs approach AM today. The six profiles include LSPs that reactively monitor AM or, in contrast, proactively leverage AM for their internal operations and the development of new services for their external customers. Among them, four profiles entail fundamental changes to the traditional business models of LSPs. We find that these LSPs oftentimes continue to rely on their traditional analog service strengths to offer integrated service bundles of AM and logistics solutions. They bridge their lack of specific resources by strategic alliances with AM experts. Only a few LSPs have started severing ties to their traditional businesses to develop digitally dominated, platform-based AM services that require different resources. Overall, the comprehensive picture of AM activities enables us to contribute to the knowledge of how LSPs navigate in the digital age and to the nexus of business model dynamics and emerging technologies.

This study aims to examine how dynamic capability can be shaped based on cooperative goal interdependence with supply chain partners by focusing on the mediating role of strategic flexibility and the moderating role of human resource flexibility. Design/methodology/approach Questionnaire surveys were administered to firm presidents, chief executive officers, chief human resources officers (CHOs) and other senior managers at 300 firms located in China. The data collection process was carried out in one wave with multiple sources. Of the firms contacted, the sample in this study consisted of 233 matched CHO-other top manager dyads. Structural equation modeling and the bias-corrected bootstrap method were used to test the proposed causal relationships, moderation model, mediation model and moderated mediation model. Findings Cooperative goal interdependence with both upstream companies and downstream companies was positively related to dynamic capability and strategic flexibility mediated these main effects. Moreover, human resource flexibility moderated the positive direct relationship between strategic flexibility and dynamic capability and the indirect relationships among cooperative goals, strategic flexibility and dynamic capability such that these relationships in companies with high human resource flexibility were stronger than these relationships in companies with low human resource flexibility. Originality/value The findings contribute to the literature on dynamic capability by providing empirical evidence regarding the relationships among cooperative goals, strategic flexibility, human resource flexibility and dynamic capability, which enriches the theory of cooperation and competition and suggests a new path to promote dynamic capability.",2021,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JBIM-11-2019-0495,C21,9,2022,Article,0,0.350539347,0,0.143735729,0,0,0,0.386859116,0,0,0,0,0.163398988,0,0.122813856,0.279034612,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.019341179,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.156149195,0,0.031307692,0,0.550218404,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.176567677,0,0,0,0,0,0.129122269,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.104728437,0,0,0,0,0.087815275,0,0,0,0.17116705,0.065873602,0,0,0,0.100181618,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.140272216,0,0,0,0.167213647,0.103101874,0,0,0,0,0,0.144915197,0.263083825,1,,,1,,,1,,,,,51

We propose a structured process based on design mechanisms, which enables strategists to overcome the impediments to generating novel strategies that have been identified in prior research. The process we theorize integrates (a) strategists' shaping intentions to transform an existing situation into a preferred one, (b) discovery-oriented exploration of problems and solutions based on designing without final goals, and (c) stakeholder dialogue to validate and extend novelty and value.

It forges a link between the literatures on cluster development and regional innovation systems (RISs), and explores both conceptually and empirically how cluster evolution is shaped by regional context conditions, including changes in the policy support structure and the knowledge base configuration of the RIS. We use qualitative research methods and descriptive statistics to analyse the development and transformation of the ICT cluster. Cluster emergence was enabled by strong analytical and synthetic knowledge bases in the region. The global crisis and changing geography of the ICT industry triggered a transformation of the cluster towards a new growth path with stronger symbolic components. Cluster transformation was facilitated by policy actions that promoted a diversification of knowledge bases in the region. The strategy was to combine existing competences in ICT with new competences in media and design, and to develop new activities around the theme of New Media, which integrates analytical, synthetic and symbolic knowledge. We show that the endowment of the RIS of a variety of knowledge bases and their combination has essentially supported long-term cluster development and transformation.

The Routledge Companion to Risk, Crisis and Security in Business comprises a professional and scholarly collection of work in this critical field. Risks come in many varieties, and there is a growing concern for organizations to respond to the challenge. Businesses can be severely impacted by natural and man-made disasters including: floods, earthquakes, tsunami, environmental threats, terrorism, supply chain risks, pandemics, and white-collar crime. An organizationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s resilience is dependent not only on their own system security and infrastructure, but also on the wider infrastructure providing health and safety, utilities, transportation, and communication. Developments in risk security and management knowledge offer a path towards resilience and recovery through effective leadership in crisis situations. The growing body of knowledge in research and methodologies is a basis for decisions to safeguard people and assets, and to ensure the survivability of an organization from a crisis. Not only can businesses become more secure through risk management, but an effective program can also facilitate innovation and afford new opportunities. With chapters written by an international selection of leading experts, this book fills a crucial gap in our current knowledge of risk, crisis and security in business by exploring a broad spectrum of topics in the field. Edited by a globally-recognized expert on risk, this book is a vital reference for researchers, professionals and students with an interest in current scholarship in this expanding discipline.

Breaking news of the Zika outbreak for instance, made it to the main media titles internationally. Perceiving disease risks motivate people to adapt their behavior toward a safer and more protective lifestyle. Computational science is instrumental in exploring patterns of disease spread emerging from many individual decisions and interactions among agents and their environment by means of agent-based models. Yet, current disease models rarely consider simulating dynamics in risk perception and its impact on the adaptive protective behavior. Social sciences offer insights into individual risk perception and corresponding protective actions, while machine learning provides algorithms and methods to capture these learning processes. This article presents an innovative approach to extend agent-based disease models by capturing behavioral aspects of decision-making in a risky context using machine learning techniques. We illustrate it with a case of cholera in Kumasi, Ghana, accounting for spatial and social risk factors that affect intelligent behavior and corresponding disease incidents. The results of computational experiments comparing intelligent with zero-intelligent representations of agents in a spatial disease agent-based model are discussed. Methods: We present a spatial disease agent-based model (ABM) with agents' behavior grounded in Protection Motivation Theory. Spatial and temporal patterns of disease diffusion among zero-intelligent agents are compared to those produced by a population of intelligent agents. Two Bayesian Networks (BNs) designed and coded using R and are further integrated with the NetLogo-based Cholera ABM. The first is a one-tier BN1 (only risk perception), the second is a two-tier BN2 (risk and coping behavior). Results: We run three experiments (zero-intelligent agents, BN1 intelligence and BN2 intelligence) and report the results per experiment in terms of several macro metrics of interest: an epidemic curve, a risk perception curve, and a distribution of different types of coping strategies over time. Conclusions: Our results emphasize the importance of integrating behavioral aspects of decision making under risk into spatial disease ABMs using machine learning algorithms. This is especially relevant when studying cumulative impacts of behavioral changes and possible intervention strategies.

A range of multifaceted strategies including education, mentoring and guidance have been implemented to increase AHPs' use of and participation in research. Emerging evidence suggests that knowledge brokering activities have the potential to support research engagement, but it is not clear which knowledge brokering strategies are most effective and in what contexts they work best to support and maintain clinicians' research engagement. Methods and analysis This protocol describes an exploratory concurrent mixed methods study that is designed to understand how allied health research fellows use knowledge brokering strategies within tailored evidence-based interventions, to facilitate research engagement by allied health clinicians. Simultaneously, a realist approach will guide a systematic process evaluation of the research fellows' pattern of use of knowledge brokering strategies within each case study to build a programme theory explaining which knowledge brokering strategies work best, in what contexts and why. Learning and behavioural theories will inform this critical explanation. Ethics and dissemination An explanation of how locally tailored evidence-based interventions improve AHPs use of, participation in and leadership of research projects will be summarised and shared with all participating clinicians and within each case study. It is expected that local recommendations will be developed and shared with medical and nursing professionals in and beyond the health service, to facilitate building research capacity in a systematic and effective way.

Identifying these adaptive genetic variabilities is crucial not only to improve our knowledge of the genetic mechanism of local adaptation but also to explore the adaptation potential of species. Results: Using 10 natural populations and 12 start codon targeted (SCoT) markers, a total of 430 unambiguous loci were yielded. The Bayesian analysis of population structure clearly demonstrated that the 10 populations of P. bungeana could be subdivided into three groups. Redundancy analysis showed that this genetic divergence was caused by divergence selection from environmental variables related to the ecological habitats of ""avoidance of flooding"" and ""avoidance of high temperature and humidity."" LFMM results indicated that Bio1, Bio5, Bio8, Bio12, Bio14, and Bio16, which are related to the ecological habitat of P. bungeana, were correlated with the highest numbers of environment-associated loci (EAL). Conclusions: The results of EAL characterization in P. bungeana clearly supported the hypothesis that environmental variations related to the ecological habitat of species are the key drivers of species adaptive divergence. Moreover, a method to calculate the species landscape adaptation index and quantify the adaptation potential of species was proposed and verified using ecological niche modeling. This model could estimate climatically suitable areas of species spatial distribution. Taking the results together, this study improves the current understanding on the genetic basis of local adaptation.

To shed new light on this unexplored gap, this research explores the multi-level moderated mediation model that examines how and when negative gossip experienced by targets in the workplace induces their knowledge hiding from coworkers drawing from the lens of social learning and cognitive theories. More specifically, this study aims to evaluate the relationship between negative workplace gossip and knowledge hiding via moral disengagement, and this mediation effect is also moderated by team relational conflict as a novel boundary condition. Design/methodology/approach: This study collected multi-wave 338 employeesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ data from 68 teams of cross-sectional industries in China, which were nested within teams. The collected nested nature data were analyzed by employing multi-level analysis based on hierarchical linear modeling. Findings: The results suggested that negative workplace gossip first triggers moral disengagement and thereby, leads to knowledge hiding. Furthermore, the direct positive association between negative workplace gossip and moral disengagement was strengthened by increasing intra-team relational conflict. In addition, the mediation effect of moral disengagement between negative workplace gossip and knowledge hiding was also strengthened through increasing intra-team relational conflict. Originality/value: This study first empirically examines the multi-level model using a new underlying mechanism (moral disengagement) and team-level boundary condition (relational conflict) and enriches the current literature on knowledge management and workplace gossip. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings and future research lines are also discussed, which will facilitate practitioners and academicians to curb counterproductive knowledge behavior.

In this study, case study is used to sort out and analyze the science popularization work carried out by the State Key Laboratories, and to explore their synergistic relationship and transformation paths. The research shows that the current model of scientific research teams participating in science popularization is shifting from task-based passive communication to responsibility-based active communication. Meanwhile, due to the significant differences in the core values, cost structure, collaborative subject and IT application of the scientific research teams, it is possible to adopt the reconstructed science popularization transformation path and the progressive popular science transformation path in the process of transformation. The research results provide a clear model and reference for the government to guide scientific research teams in conducting science popularization works in an orderly manner.

However, some processes are formally prescribed and manually driven to only visualize the design concepts. The purpose of this paper is to present a proactive framework for integrating parametric design thinking, paying particular attention to building facade patterning. Design/methodology/approach: This work developed the PatternGenÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â© add-on in AutodeskÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Revit which utilizes an analytical image data (AID) overlay approach as a data source to dynamically pattern the building facade. The add-on was used to manipulate the placement rules of curtain panels on facade surface geometry. As means of validating this research model, a real-life design project has been chosen to illustrate the practical application of this approach. Feedback and observations from a short end-user questionnaire assessed qualitatively the facade patterning and panelization approach. Findings: The proposed merge (or overlay) of AID images can be used as a parametric thinking method rather than just theory to generate and articulate dynamic facade design. The facade panelization responds to an AID that resembles design-performance data (e.g. solar exposure, interior privacy importance and aesthetics). Originality/value: This work identifies a form of parametric thinking defined as the expression of geometrical relationships and its configuration dependent on the AID pixel Red Green Blue color source values. In this type of thinking, it explores the impact of the digital process and parametric thinking utility when driven by an AID overlay. The framework highlighted the practical application of AID pixel approach within a digital process to benefit both designers and computational tools developer on emerging design innovations.

The proliferation of UMI technologies will not only change the way we live but can also offer new learning opportunities. At the same time, there is an increasing need for skills that are associated with the UMI domain in the labour market. The Umi-Sci-Ed is an EU project which explores ways to shed new light into this training aspect by introducing several model educational scenarios that incorporate UMI technologies, in order to cultivate relevant competences on high school students. This paper reports initial results achieved in this context. In particular, we give an overview of the key components of the UMI-Sci-Ed platform that aims to support the activities of Communities of Practice involved in STEM education. Students through a mentoring mechanism are provided with training material, IoT hardware kits and software tools to explore UMI technologies through hands-on activities. In this framework, example educational scenarios and the corresponding UMI applications developed are presented. The hypothesis is that the learning process can be empowered by using such UMI applications as students are provided with meaningful opportunities to participate in the learning process such as in terms of building applications that are relevant to the subject they like and having active interactions within student groups in a way that practical experiences can provide them a rich context to grasp scientific knowledge. Finally, the results of a preliminary evaluation of the proposed approach in the context of an educational workshop are discussed.

We intend to explore the complicated translation processes between different actors after linking them together. Accordingly, we suggest a new theoretical approach in community empowerment studies, that is, a Bottom-up-Local-Open- Reassembling (BLOR) actor-network. Confronted by a risk society derived from globalization, the BLOR actor-network particularly fits such a context due to its fault-tolerant and malleable traits. These traits make it beneficial to appreciate the local context and open participation, and facilitate collective brainstorming to find innovative solutions. This paper assumes the community to be a place with heterogeneous components and openness. The university works in partnership with local communities and co-constructs a social practice actor-network to respond to social problems. The university-community partnership seeks to overcome the limitations of current community empowerment projects such as working as a closed system and power centralization. The university serves as a medium for linking different issues with different groups of community actors and translating different cultural traits among diverse actors, which generates an open and intertwined social practice network, namely, the BLOR actor-network, which is rooted in this region. The BLOR actor-network is not fixed. Instead, it reassembles itself according to the changes in its components, needs and social context, in order to enable heterogeneous components to coexist. In this paper, we emphasize not only the traits of the BLOR actor-network, but also the mechanisms that enable these components to co-function. With this objective in mind, we adopt two cases from the HIPS project to illustrate what the mechanisms are and how they function. Copyright Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2018 Taiwanese Political Science Association.

It examines text-mining software and analyzes patent data as well as academic and business journals to illustrate the paradigm shift of newly emerging technologies, such as the all-solid-state battery and automatic driving for electric vehicles, and surgical robots. It also explores the critical role of emerging software technologies by examining US, EU, and Japanese patent statistics. Highlighting the paradigm shift of technologies since the 1990s and the geographical dispersion of innovative capabilities, it identifies essential trends toward new innovation systems as well as the concentration and dispersion of national and corporate R&D capabilities that have taken place as a result. In this new paradigm, the competitiveness of a company is decisively determined by other innovations in systems and management. Since the 1990s, when a network economy began to be established and technological know-how came to be easily transferred across borders, the changing structure of technological activities has required organizations with traditional integral and closed architecture models to move toward open innovation or modular architectures. These changes involve wider technological areas and cognitive diversity among international inter-firm and intra-firm R&D networks. This book is highly recommended not only to academicians but also to business people seeking an in-depth and up-to-date overview of the paradigm shift of technologies and new innovation systems.

It is based on an interactive reinforcement learning workflow, which enables agents to incrementally learn how to act on an environment by balancing exploitation of human feedback knowledge and exploration of new musical content. In a controlled experiment, participants successfully interacted with these agents to reach a sonic goal in two cases of different complexities. Subjective evaluations suggest that the exploration path taken by agents, rather than the fact of reaching a goal, may be critical to how agents are perceived as collaborative. We discuss such quantitative and qualitative results and identify future research directions toward deploying our ""co-exploration"" approach in real-world contexts.

In such cases, the general manager function and its associated responsibilities are shared between two (or more) people in various configurations. How do such models emerge? How do co-leaders organize themselves concretely? What are the pros and cons of co-leading? Through a qualitative exploratory study of eight SEOs in which co-leading was experimented, our research proposes answers to these questions, which were initially asked by practitioners.

As an emerging network technology and industrial mode, Internet of Things (IoT) has great application prospect because of its architecture advantages and technical features, and has drawn wide attention from all walks of life. With the development of IoT, especially the putting forward of concept of public safety IoT, IoT has been a certain degree of application in the field of public safety. Because of that, public safety regulatory technology is improved. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach By summarizing scholars' research results, this paper analyzes the application of IoT in public safety regulation, points out the challenges in application, and then puts forward some suggestions, pointing out IoT development prospects in the area of public safety regulation. Findings The application of IoT in the field of public safety from the perspective of IoT architecture and the perspective of the main technologies of IoT is paid attention. And this market that IoT added to other services in the public sector would generate $4.6 trillion of net profit globally in the next decade. Therefore, government leaders and public safety organizations should start exploring the full potential that IoT could offer to public safety. Originality/value The research will develop the theory of IOT, which is valuable to strengthen the IOT technology innovation and the application extension.

First, we derive an analytical framework that contextualises circular supply chain collaboration. Second, based on this framework, we conduct a systematic literature review that explores how Industry 4.0 technologies can enable collaboration mechanisms. The review shows that information sharing and joint planning and decision-making are the most common collaboration mechanisms studied. Simultaneously, the Internet of Things, Blockchain, and Cloud Systems are the most discussed technologies to enable those mechanisms.

Research on adaptive governance has flourished since the field's inception, probing the process and mechanisms underpinning the new approach while offering various justifications and prescriptions for empirical use. Nevertheless, recent reviews of adaptive governance reveal some important conceptual and practical gaps in the field, particularly concerning challenges in its application to real-world cases. In this paper, we respond directly to the empirical challenge of adaptive governance, specifically asking: which methods contribute to the implementation of successful adaptive governance process and outcomes in practice and across cases and contexts? We adopt a systematic literature review methodology which considers the current body of empirical literature on adaptive governance of social-ecological systems in order to assess and analyse the methods affecting successful adaptive governance practice across the range of existing cases. We find that methods contributing to adaptive governance in practice resemble the design recommendations outlined in previous adaptive governance scholarship, including meaningful collaboration across actors and scales; effective coordination between stakeholders and levels; building social capital; community empowerment and engagement; capacity development; linking knowledge and decision-making through data collection and monitoring; promoting leadership capacity; and exploiting or creating governance opportunities. However, we critically contextualise these methods by analysing and summarising their patterns-in-use, drawing examples from the cases to explore the specific ways they were successfully or unsuccessfully applied to governance issues on-the-ground. Our results indicate some important underlying shared patterns, trajectories, and lessons learned for evidence-based adaptive governance good practice within and across diverse sectors, issues, and contexts.",2018,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.05.067,C10,1,2022,Journal,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.099667215,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.318721547,0,0,0,0,0.022605823,0,0.082467978,0,0,0,0.213053841,0.154564908,0,0,0,0.224643334,0,0.182505998,0,0.073184386,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.103185483,0.107653828,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.734434831,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.042070286,0.205466186,0,0,0,0.189347075,0,0.171237439,0,0,0.190433026,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.125311902,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,,1,,,,,1,1,,29

To cope with these challenges, vendors are forming partnerships with other firms to access and leverage new and complementary resources, capabilities, and knowledge. Building on prior work on two traditionally distinct literature streams-interfirm networks and software ecosystems-we theorize that structural characteristics of a software vendor's partner network can influence its firm value. Specifically, we argue and find empirical support that partner network size, interconnectedness, and diversity impact firm value, measured by market capitalization for publicly listed firms and total funding for privately held firms, and that the association between structure and firm value differs by vendor type (legacy versus cloud-native). We explore these associations using a data-driven ecosystem analysis of 5429 firms, apply text analytic methods to differentiate vendors by technology stack focus (infrastructure, platform, software), and complement our empirical analyses with visualizations of the collaborative structure of the cloud computing ecosystem.

These are all aiming at planning, performing, compiling and leveraging knowledge exchange and co-creating sustainable results. This conceptual paper draws on an initial literature review on how established frameworks and models in the field of university-society collaboration are related to contemporary drivers of collaboration, such as co-creation, trust and relationship building. The aim of the paper is to gain deeper insights in the complex dynamics of collaboration by exploring relevant research literature and to suggest future directions for research in university-society collaboration. Hence, the research questions to be addressed in this paper are: What are the key drivers that underlie the dynamics of university-society collaboration? How can university-society collaboration be approached in order to facilitate co-creating results? The results suggest that the key driver for university-society collaboration is trust. However, there are several underlying triggers and mechanisms facilitating trust.

We explore the effect and mechanism of digital inclusive finance (DIF) on agricultural green total factor productivity. Our empirical results show that during the sample period, China's agricultural green total factor productivity has shown an increasing trend. Digital inclusive finance mainly promotes agricultural GTFP by improving green technology level. The coverage rate, the application rate and the digitalization rate of digital inclusive finance all generate positive effects on agricultural green total factor productivity, among which the coverage rate contributes the most. Besides, the positive effect of digital inclusive finance in the eastern coastal areas is more significant than in other areas. The analysis of the mechanism shows that digital inclusive finance can indirectly help improve agricultural green total factor productivity through motivating agricultural technology innovation and industrial structure optimization.

The emerging environmental protection (EP) industry has become prominent recently because it has set high standards for technology and equipment, and has been tasked to provide solutions to difficult environmental problems. In this paper we looked at the performance of the EP industry using econometric software, intellectual capital architecture and data collected from 35 Chinese enterprises for 2010 through 2014. Intellectual capital (IC) is subdivided into human capital (HC), innovation capital (INC) and structure capital (SC). Using the Value Added Intellectual Capital coefficient (VAIC), we have built a multiple regression model to explore the relationship between the performance of IC and EP. We found that while the human and structural components of IC exert a significant positive influence on enterprise performance, innovation capital does not. We have offered suggestions for performance improvements to the EP industry through IC management.

This paper explores the potential of cross-cultural learning and Indigenous knowledge as deep leverage points-hard to pull but truly transformative-for inner world sustainability transformations. In this exploratory study we propose a theoretical model of the inner transformation-sustainability nexus based on three distinctive inside-out pathways of transformation. Each pathway is activated at the inner world of individuals and cascades through the outer levels (individual and collective) of the iceberg model, ultimately resulting in transformations of the individual's relationship with others, non-humans, or oneself. Our main purpose is to empirically investigate the activation of inner leverage points among graduate students who are alumni of an Indigenous language field school in the Ecuadorian Amazon. Semi-structured interviews designed around three core aspects-(1) human-nature relationships; (2) subjective change; and (3) acknowledgment for Indigenous culture-yielded expressions of becoming aware of new forms of relationships and empirically illustrate the roles of deep leverage points in triggering the three inside-out pathways of our model.

The paper explores the origins of this phenomenon in the context of three industry settings: cars, speciality coffee and personal computers. The analysis theorizes three distinct strategic paths that explain how design may become an institutionalized aspect of competition in industries that are not creative. We explain how firms link their products to the identities of their users, how design is linked to stakeholders' emotions and visceral reactions to products and how intermediaries are relevant to enhancing attention to design.

Projects are temporary structures and are underpinned by different mechanisms than stable organizations, and projects have been pointed to as contexts where there is a high potential for knowledge production, learning and innovation. In addition, increasingly both public and private organizations with a stable structure also govern a portfolio of projects for tasks that are not standardized and part of the hierarchical permanent organizational structure. However, limited empirical research have recorded the knowledge dynamics between the stable and temporary structures in such hybrid organizations. We have collected data longitudinally, in real time, in two Professional Service Firms (PSFs) to observe how learning experiences obtained in terminated projects affect current project work and to what extent current project activities shape future strategies. PSFs are specialised knowledge intensive firms such as law, accounting or engineering firms, and firms within financial or management consulting. An increasing number of scholars is looking at this particular type of knowledge intensive firms to understand both issues related to the management of human capital and knowledge, and the dynamics involved in knowledge development as a source of advantage. The performance of the PSFs is based both on the ability to attract and recruit good professionals, on reputation, and on references and experiences from previous projects. In PSFs the norm is to organize work in projects. Theory on learning from projects problematizes the opportunity to learn from projects due to their temporality. In contrast, our findings suggest that the projects themselves are the very mechanisms that connect what the organization already knows with what the organization attempts to become. The projects need to relate to both the permanent structures of the organization and the shifting body of individual expertise involved as input to project delivery. Simultaneously, the project activities - aimed at solving client challenges also foster multiple situated learning outcomes and build client relations and brand recognition. We reveal how different learning processes occurring between the stable organizational structures and the portfolio of temporary project structures and offer a model identifying 4 main microprocesses. The four micro-processes provide the opportunity to distinguish between the phases of exploration and exploitation that are involved when professionals utilize both professional knowledge and organizational capabilities in their daily project work.

From the perspective of a policy-maker, extreme risks are likely to be viewed initially through the lens of experience of risk in policy-making more generally. Approaches to the management of well-characterised risks in the context of civil emergencies show the importance of linking assessments of risk to the purpose of making the assessment, of communication and engagement, and of avoiding groupthink and narrow disciplinary discussions. In some cases where the risks cannot be well-characterised or easily imagined, new forms of visualisation and narrative, including futures work, can be used to shape and bound the risks and to engage policy-makers or citizens.

However, there are few researches on the measurement of knowledge transfer efficiency in the context of OI networks. To make up this gap, this study explores the measurement of knowledge transfer efficiency based on the weighted OI network. Firstly, this paper builds the weighted OI network model with node and edge weights. On the basis of the weighted OI network model, the weighted path length and clustering coefficient are introduced and analysed. Moreover, the efficiency of knowledge transfer is further proposed as the main measure of knowledge transfer efficiency by comprehensively embodying the above factors, and then an extended application of the proposed main measure is developed to identify and locate the important members with great impact on knowledge transfer. Finally, a real case of several OI networks is provided to illustrate the applicability of the weighted OI network model and the knowledge transfer efficiency measurement method.

The proliferation of UMI technologies will not only change the way we live but can also offer new learning opportunities. At the same time, there is an increasing need for skills that are associated with the UMI domain in the labour market. The Umi-Sci-Ed is an EU project which explores ways to shed new light into this training aspect by introducing several model educational scenarios that incorporate UMI technologies, in order to cultivate relevant competences on high school students. This paper reports initial results achieved in this context. In particular, we give an overview of the key components of the UMI-Sci-Ed platform that aims to support the activities of Communities of Practice involved in STEM education. Students through a mentoring mechanism are provided with training material, IoT hardware kits and software tools to explore UMI technologies through hands-on activities. In this framework, example educational scenarios and the corresponding UMI applications developed are presented. The hypothesis is that the learning process can be empowered by using such UMI applications as students are provided with meaningful opportunities to participate in the learning process such as in terms of building applications that are relevant to the subject they like and having active interactions within student groups in a way that practical experiences can provide them a rich context to grasp scientific knowledge.

Learning processes, however, are subject to some important limitations. As is well-known, learning has to cope with confusing experience and the complicated problem of balancing the competing goals of developing new knowledge (i.e., exploring) and exploiting current competencies in the face of dynamic tendencies to emphasize one or the other. We examine the ways organizations approach these problems through simplification and specialization and how those approaches contribute to three forms of learning myopia, the tendency to overlook distant times, distant places, and failures, and we identify some ways in which organizations sustain exploration in the face of a tendency to overinvest in exploitation. We conclude that the imperfections of learning are not so great as to require abandoning attempts to improve the learning capabilities of organizations, but that those imperfections suggest a certain conservatism in expectations.",1993,,,C8,1,2019,Journal,0.139556251,0.393966158,0.141307915,0.21539004,0.090344665,0.138266791,0.13171458,0,0.127783804,0.111903664,0,0,0.122427857,0,0.092019157,0,0,0,0.111595727,0,0,0,0.101440613,0,0.05286629,0,0,0,0,0.198168393,0,0,0,0,0.101763688,0,0,0.070372534,0,0,0,0.127783804,0,0.214222304,0.117655409,0,0,0,0,0,0.181639179,0,0,0.096745781,0.110073268,0,0,0.078468528,0,0,0,0.173736708,0,0,0.128248133,0.065796221,0,0,0.269849633,0.128248133,0,0.053938511,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.219544323,0.078878853,0.192704539,0.366232612,0.122398242,0.070297322,0.048785692,0,0,0,0.128626088,0,0,0.125286017,0.077249814,0,0,0,0,0.126016508,0,0,1,,,1,1,1,1,,,,,11

Underlying this question is a rich debate about whether organizations can adaptÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âand if so how. One perspective, organizational ecology, presents evidence suggesting that most organizations are largely inert and ultimately fail. A second perspective argues that some firms do learn and adapt to shifting environmental contexts. Recently, this latter view has coalesced around two themes. The first, based on research in strategy suggests that dynamic capabilities, the ability of a firm to reconfigure assets and existing capabilities, explains long-term competitive advantage. The second, based on organizational design, argues that ambidexterity, the ability of a firm to simultaneously explore and exploit, enables a firm to adapt over time. In this paper, we review and integrate these comparatively new research streams and identify a set of propositions that suggest how ambidexterity acts as a dynamic capability.

Particularly unclear are the differential and interaction effects of contractual and relational governance mechanisms on relationship learning and joint innovation. To investigate these effects, we propose and validate a research model through survey data from 344 senior-level IT employees of firms that collaborate with a vendor on strategic innovation.

As the world is increasingly populated by IoT devices and sensors that can sense their surroundings and communicate with each other, a digital environment has been created with vast volumes of volatile and diverse data. Traditional AI and machine learning techniques designed for deterministic situations are not suitable for such environments. With a large number of parameters required by each device in this digital environment, it is desirable that the AI is able to be adaptive and self-build (i.e. self-structure, self-configure, self-learn), rather than be structurally and parameter-wise pre-defined. This study explores the benefits of self-building AI and machine learning with unsupervised learning for empowering big data analytics for smart city environments. By using the growing self-organizing map, a new suite of self-building AI is proposed. The self-building AI overcomes the limitations of traditional AI and enables data processing in dynamic smart city environments.

Additionally, it evaluated the influence of CEO cognitive trust on the marketing innovation of small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs). Design/methodology/approach The authors empirically assessed the impact of CEO cognitive trust on SMME marketing innovation. Furthermore, the authors examined the mediating effect of governmental support on this relationship. The authors then studied a sample of 1,770 SMMEs in China by applying partial least squares structural equation modeling. Findings The authors found that CEO cognitive trust was negatively associated with marketing innovation. Moreover, governmental support has a competitive mediating effect on this relationship. Thus, while governmental support is urgently needed to enhance the marketing innovation of SMMEs, CEO cognitive trust negatively impacts this relationship. Research limitations/implications This study empirically establishes the importance of CEO cognitive trust and governmental support as antecedents in SMME marketing innovation. This contributes to the knowledge base of the management field, adding to important streams in the wider business literature, such as marketing studies, leadership management, strategic management and innovation. While the model is parsimonious, the relationships it highlights are robust and can be generalized to other contexts. Practical implications Managers must not only have high levels of trust and authority but must also embody these characteristics rationally. Simultaneously, managers must actively establish a trusting relationship with the government, thereby improving their company's ability to integrate government policy information while also actively seeking governmental support. These measures are helpful in enhancing the marketing innovation capabilities of SMMEs. Social implications SMMEs occupy an important position in all countries' economies and their vitality directly determines the strength of the economy. Formulating reasonable marketing strategies will help enhance market competitiveness and promote the rapid development of SMMEs. Originality/value The literature on marketing innovation has paid little attention to CEO cognitive trust, while CEOs' cognitive characteristics are an increasingly relevant antecedent in SMME marketing innovation. This study analyzed CEO cognitive trust as a possible antecedent of marketing innovation activities in SMMEs, with this influence path being evaluated.

Moreover, the data were collected from 288 SMEs. Therefore, future studies can be conducted from any other country with larger sample size. This study has used moderation of innovation capabilities and future studies can use information credibility as a moderating variable. Originality/value - Previously, many studies have highlighted the importance of knowledge for innovation, but the effects of knowledge sources from the perspective of SMEs and emerging markets remain unexplained. Very limited studies have explored the relation of knowledge sources with frugal innovation. This study first examines the moderating role of innovation capabilities between internal and external knowledge sources and frugal innovation. Moreover, this research reveals the SMEs of Saudi Arabia and its sector of frugal products.",2021,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJIS-09-2020-0130,C7,9,2020,Book Chapter,0,0.140974737,0,0,0.096985351,0.148429941,0.141396116,0.155581285,0.068588206,0,0,0.141819536,0,0,0.098782925,0,0,0.073111769,0,0,0,0,0.031113398,0,0,0.388687213,0,0,0,0,0.11592611,0,0,0.154593296,0,0,0,0.17627211,0,0,0.127017309,0,0.156079497,0.11498424,0,0.101953159,0,0.142018761,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.116878236,0,0.084236272,0.131050713,0,0,0,0,0.146170486,0.137674872,0.0706325,0,0.122139133,0.144842318,0,0,0.144758005,0,0,0,0,0,0.547683176,0,0,0.068956359,0.131050713,0.065697495,0,0,0,0,0.112825216,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.111915994,0.238938246,0,0,0.105803167,1,,,1,1,1,1,,,,,11

Design/methodology/approach The authors used Mplus and SPSS (Statistical Product and Service Solutions) to test the proposed model with data from 278 enterprises that have established national or municipal enterprise technology centers. In this study, questionnaires were collected through commission and field investigation. Findings The results indicate that managers' NFB has a significant positive impact on local and cross-border knowledge search and on the incremental and radical innovation of enterprises. Knowledge search is positively correlated with enterprise innovation and can play a mediating role between the managers' NFB and enterprise innovation. Network capability can positively moderate the relationship between managers' NFB and cross-border knowledge search but has no significant impact on the relationship between managers' NFB and local knowledge search. Originality/value Although there have been many studies of managers' cognition, little is known about how managers' NFB influences enterprise behavior and enterprise innovation. This study incorporates managers' NFB and knowledge search into the research model and examines the moderating effect of network capability between managers' NFB and knowledge search from an interactive perspective.

Although research has highlighted the importance of value creation and capture of business models, it primarily focused on the value creation mechanisms and neglected aspects of value capturing: Until to date, little is known about how firms attempt to protect their business models from competition, which is a critical component of value capture. Drawing on a sample of 24 cases, we explore how business models relate to IP protection mechanisms for value capture and derive a business model protection framework. Our empirical study reveals that the choice of IP protection is contingent on the applied business model. Whereas some razor and blade business models are characterised by a high degree of both formal and informal protection, firms operating franchising business models put higher emphasis on informal protection strategies. Firms running the pay-per-use business model or the multi-sided platform business model apply formal and informal protection strategies to a medium degree in order to capture value.

The analysis identified and described five US strengths (i.e. technology leaders, innovative tolerant culture, technology agnostic, market driven, speed) contributing industrial renewal through digitalisation, and five US weaknesses (i.e. technology driven, disorganised convergence, not part of the cultural identity, competitive not collaborative, short term perspective) inhibiting it. The strengths and weaknesses were further considered as they pertain to individuals, businesses and national policy. The study highlighted the systemic nature of the identified strengths and weaknesses, and suggested that in addition to policymakers, also research community and businesses should further strengthen what is already strong in the innovation system to indirectly mitigate the weaknesses.",2020,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1463922X.2019.1621404,C14,1,2017,Conference Paper,0.066620436,0.062689649,0,0,0,0,0.188631093,0,0.152501458,0.747877586,0,0.315326602,0,0.207554978,0,0.049901907,0,0.032511862,0,0.065199015,0,0,0.006917864,0,0,0.172844195,0,0,0,0.047300155,0,0.137929398,0.054013453,0,0,0.055850724,0.135337046,0.022395982,0,0,0,0.061000583,0,0,0,0.045337256,0.068095799,0.031576956,0,0,0.043354852,0.109536921,0,0,0.052546045,0,0.046924484,0,0.058276564,0,0,0,0,0.130000263,0.061222242,0,0,0,0,0,0.023561366,0.012874404,0,0,0.071664999,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.033558069,0,0,0.062689649,0,0.122805335,0.106839655,0.172082056,0,0.110631009,0,0,0,0.05312638,0,0.1036652,0,1,,,1,1,1,1,,,,1,5

Design/methodology/approach - The authors adopt a qualitative case-study approach informed by ethnomethodology. Data were obtained via semi-structured interviews and document analysis. Findings - They found that in an open innovation setting - where the producing partner relies on a research partner for all product development activities - a stage-gate product development process can act as a governance mechanism, as it enables the development of trust and cooperation which supports the co-development relationship. Research limitations/implications - The implication of this finding is that a stage-gate process can be a flexible governance mechanism, which can adapt over time in relation to the needs of the co-development partners in an open innovation setting. This also lays the groundwork for future research to explore the applicability of this tool in other settings, e.g. outsourcing arrangements as well as help guide the design and implementation of future governance mechanisms.

Drawing from a large-scale action research study involving a complex collaborative organizational construct, we outline three challenges from employing action research: the process is both reflexive and progressive, the researcher is both an outsider and an insider, and the outcome is both general and specific. A model of three social spaces (the action research space, the academic space, and the practitioner space) is proposed to address the challenges and assist in navigating the multitude of processes, roles, and outcomes associated with action research. The study argues that action research for IM is well suited to exploring tacit aspects of practices and processes in the emergent or shifting study contexts to transform practices through interventions. Thus, if implemented carefully by experienced researchers, it can provide valuable data that are indispensable for theory development in the field of IM. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2020 The Authors.

The three themes are of great importance to the sustainable competitive advantage of organizations. In general, although they are inserted in the discussion of organizational learning, they are still in the evolutionary process regarding antecedents, moderators, and outcomes, as can be observed in the theoretical reference. It has not been possible to identify studies with similar characteristics as the one presented here, i.e., studies linking exploration and exploitation with absorptive capacity, particularly in the Brazilian context. The main objective was to evaluate the degree of association between exploration, exploitation, and absorptive capacity. This study used quantitative research in 100 companies operating in commerce and services sectors, all located in the city of Palmas, Tocantins State. The sector was chosen based on the concentration of commercial and services companies in the city. The informants were the managers who worked in these companies. The questionnaire involved the use of two scales: one scale for the measurement of exploration and exploitation, and the other scale for measuring the absorptive capacity, both validated by early studies. The technique involved structural equation modeling using Partial Least Square-Path Modeling (PLS-PM) software was used for the verification of the principal hypothesis. The concepts of exploration and exploitation were based on six dimensions: organizational knowledge practices, innovation practices, strategic orientation, competition, partnerships, and efficiency. The concept of absorptive capacity was based on four dimensions: porosity, routines and structures, public knowledge, and individual abilities. The results showed that companies had exploitation orientation. Regarding the absorptive capacity, companies had a high relationship with the environment, with routines and with procedures, and with public knowledge. The main hypothesis was confirmed, indicating a positive relationship between exploration, exploitation, and absorptive capacity.

The capabilities can be fostered when the leader is oriented towards digital technology and market orientation. The role of digital leadership has gained attention for studies to develop innovation and dynamic capabilities based on market orientation. Studies have been conducted on dynamic capabilities with focus on the strategy, management and economic literature including the understanding of its driving key to success. However, the study on the role of digital leadership on the development of dynamic capability based on innovation capability and market orientation has not been intensively discussed. It is argued that the development of dynamic capability and innovation capability is strongly driven from a combination of digital leadership and market orientation. Data in this study is taken from a survey conducted on 88 Indonesian telecommunication firms as a unit for analyses. The results show that digital leadership had a strong direct and indirect relationship with dynamic capability, however the strong path in developing capability is determined from the development of innovation capability that is driven from digital leadership based on market orientation. The finding reinforces the role of digital leadership as a critical influence on development of dynamic capability. Future studies are suggested to extend the research by exploring the research model to elaborate more on the impact of collaboration, leveraging a larger sample size and better statistical tools. A longitudinal study on the companies that implement the transformation based on dynamic capabilities is also recommended for future studies.

Value appropriation focuses on exploiting existing knowledge to develop software that meets market requirements. Value creation focuses on exploring the solution space to innovate and attract new customers. In this pilot research, we study the tension between software project controls and the goal of novelty in the software product. Two case studies provide preliminary evidence that a well-balanced portfolio of controls can result in the design and implementation of novel product features. We position the case studies in the context of digital platforms to bound our definitions of control mechanisms and novelty. Based on analysis of data collected from two case studies, we find that formal and informal control modes can positively influence novelty in software applications on digital platforms. We conclude with a discussion on implications for software development and future research directions. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2021, EasyChair.

The purpose of this study is to explore enablers of supply chain resilience. In particular, the authors examine whether and how dynamic capabilities and knowledge management can help firms develop a resilient supply chain in times of high disruption and uncertainty. Design/methodology/approach: A single longitudinal case study design was adopted. Data was collected over 8Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â years from a Pakistani textile producer and supplier through semi-structured interviews and was analyzed through NVivo to generate codes and themes that contributed to the development of the supply chain resilience model. Findings: The analysis of case study shows that our focal firm strategically acquired, transferred and integrated market knowledge by investing in digital technologies and idiosyncratic resources and consequently developed a supply chain model that was resilient in addressing logistics and delivery challenges in uncertain & critical times. Research limitations/implications: The study brings together three main research streams of organizational theory, namely supply chain, knowledge management and dynamic capabilities, and proposes a nuanced resilient supply chain model. Practical implications: By applying the research findings, managers can adjust, develop and adopt supply chain resilience to address market volatilities, thereby creating value and longevity in their supply chain operations. However, the findings are context specific and should be applied cautiously. Originality/value: The outcomes provide early hints on how companies in emerging economies can adopt and integrate novel digital technologies, and overhaul their organizational routines to facilitate knowledge management and develop dynamic capabilities, and consequently enhance the resilience of their supply chain operations.

Because of this new dual role PSM needs to balance the short-term goals referred to as exploitation, and the long-term strategic goals referred to as exploration. However, developing in-depth knowledge of the supply markets in order to achieve PSM ambidexterity is challenging, as it requires much managerial attention that is limited in nature. This research draws on the attention-based view (ABV) to study the antecedents of ambidexterity in PSM. Based on a survey of 154 Finnish manufacturing firms, a set of hypotheses was tested using structural equation modeling. The results indicate that bottom-up supply market attention has a stronger association than top-down supply market attention with all three PSM goals: exploitation, exploration and ambidexterity. PSM status is positively associated with both bottom-up and top-down supply market attention. Top management should support activities aimed at capturing supply market opportunities by ensuring that the PSM staff is not overburdened and have enough time to focus on supply market intelligence gathering and analyses. This research is among the first to study the role and enablers of attentional mechanisms that underpin ambidexterity in PSM. A contribution to the ABV theory is made by suggesting operationalizations of managerial attention constructs.

However, the relatedness between these dimensions of resilience in healthcare has not yet been studied. This study seeks to develop a conceptual understanding of adaptation and innovation as a basis for resilience in healthcare. The overall aim of this study is therefore to explore how adaptation and innovation can be described and understood across different healthcare settings. To this end, the overall aim will be investigated by identifying what constitutes adaptation and innovation in healthcare, the mechanisms involved, and what type of responses adaptation and innovation are associated with. Methods: The method used to develop understanding across a variety of healthcare contexts, was to first conduct a narrative inquiry of a comprehensive dataset from various empirical settings (e.g., maternity, transitional care, telecare), that were later analysed in accordance with grounded theory. Narrative inquiry provided a contextually informed synthesis of the phenomenon, while the use of grounded theory methodology allowed for cross-contextual comparison of adaptation and innovation in terms of resilience in healthcare. Results: The results identified an imbalance between adaptation and innovation. If short-term adaptations are used too extensively, they may mask system deficiencies and furthermore leave the organization vulnerable, by relying too much on the efforts of a few individuals. Hence, short-term adaptations may end up a barrier for resilience in healthcare. Long-term adaptations and innovation of products, processes and practices proved to be of a lower priority, but had the potential of addressing the flaws of the system by proactively re-organizing and re-designing routines and practices. Conclusions: This study develops a new conceptual account of adaptation and innovation as a basis for resilience in healthcare. Findings emerging from this study indicate that a balance between adaptation and innovation should be sought when seeking resilience in healthcare. Adaptations can furthermore be divided into short-term and long-term adaptations, creating the need to balance between these different types of adaptations. Short-term adaptations that adopt the pattern of firefighting can risk generating complex and unintended outcomes, but where no significant changes are made to organization of the system. Long-term adaptations, on the other hand, introduce re-organization of the system based on feedback, and therefore can provide a proactive response to system deficiencies. We propose a pattern of adaptation in resilience in healthcare: from short-term adjustments, to long-term reorganizations, to innovations.

Not surprisingly, this phenomenon has spawned a growing literature trying to sort out the determinants of patented research in China. However, mostly due to data limitations, many of the papers on this topic use aggregated innovation data at the industry, prefecture, or province levels. In this paper, we examine the empirical validity of important theories of knowledge spillover in the context of China at a micro-level, using a firm-level panel dataset comprised of publicly traded companies listed in the Shanghai and ShenZhen Stock Exchanges during the 2006-2010 period. Our study sheds light on whether locating near innovative firms increases patenting activity in general, regardless of the industry membership of these neighboring firms. We also explore how industry makeup, measured by the number of firms in the same or different industries, affects firm-level patenting activity. Our econometric results show that the number of patent applications by firms in close geographic proximity of a firm of interest has a significant and positive impact on that firm's successful patent applications. In addition, we find that proximity to firms in the same industry reduces innovation while locating near firms from different industries stimulates innovation.

This research aims to explore this topic further by including within the model the concept of green innovation. In particular, this paper empirically tests the mediating role of green innovation performance in the relationship between market orientation and organizational performance. This study relies on a sample of 145 firms belonging to the Spanish automotive components manufacturing sector. The results obtained by applying Partial Least Squares (PLS) path-modeling, a variance-based structural equations modeling technique, reveal that market orientation exerts a direct impact on organizational performance.

Hence, exploring the antecedents of innovation performance becomes more important. This study analyses the relationships among innovation stimulus, facilitating factors and support mechanisms for innovative performance in the textile industry of Santa Catarina, Brazil. The sample included 128 respondents, who were all employees of five small and medium-sized textile firms; data were analysed using structural equation modelling. We found that innovation stimulus, facilitating factors and support mechanisms are correlated, while support mechanisms have no influence on innovation performance. The results also highlight a concern regarding the cost and time spent on developing innovation projects. This research contributes to innovation performance literature by analysing innovation antecedents including visions of innovation as both a process, represented by efficiency, and a result, represented by efficacy.

Empirical data were collected from 196 entrepreneurs and top executives in Chinese high-tech new ventures using an interview survey. An established mediation model's assessment approach was used to test hypotheses through multivariate linear regression analyses. The analysis results show that both effectuation and causation have positive effects on opportunity identification. Also, emergent/planned knowledge integration plays a fully mediating role in the relationship between effectuation/causation and opportunity identification. This research contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence to explain the problem of entrepreneurial opportunity identification under high uncertainty through the lens of effectuation theory. It facilitates the development of effectuation theory and enriches the literature on strategic knowledge integration.

This study explores the structural properties of such relationships and their possible influences on organizational innovations in terms of exploitation and exploration in the emerging nano-energy field. Results indicate that the knowledge networks and the technology-based collaboration networks in the nano-energy field are decoupled and that they have different degrees of integration. Some structural features of knowledge and collaboration networks influence organizations' exploitative and exploratory innovations in diverse ways. Firstly, direct ties of an organization's knowledge elements in a knowledge network have an inverted U-shaped effect on its exploitative innovation, which is not the case in exploratory innovation. Direct ties in a collaboration network have an inverted U-shaped effect on both its exploitative and exploratory innovations. Secondly, indirect ties of an organization's knowledge elements in a knowledge network affect its exploitative innovation, but not its exploratory innovation. However, indirect ties in a collaboration network affect exploratory innovation, but not exploitative innovation. Thirdly, non-redundancy among ties in a knowledge network exhibits the opposite effect, hindering exploitative innovation, but favoring exploratory innovation. By contrast, non-redundancy among ties in a collaboration network favors exploitative innovation, but shows a non-significant effect on exploratory innovation. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It also deepens understanding of the pathways and conditions to improve the innovation capability by assessing the mediating role of both KM practices, i.e., knowledge exploration practices, and knowledge exploitation practices. Background Knowledge is the main organisational resource that is able to generate a competitive advantage through innovation. It is a critical success driver for both knowledge exploration and exploitation for firms to achieve sustainable competitive advantages. Methodology A total of 320 questionnaires were disseminated to Malaysian R&D firms and the response rate was 47 percent. The paper utilised structural equation modelling and cross-sectional design to test hypotheses in the proposed research model. Contribution This paper provides useful information and valuable initiatives in exploring the mediating role of knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation in influencing innovation in Malaysian R&D firms. It helps R&D firms to frame their KM activities to drive the capability of creating and retaining a greater value onto their core business competencies. Findings The findings indicate that all three KM-centred strategies (leadership, HR practices, and culture) have a direct effect on innovation. In addition, KM exploration practices mediate HR practices on innovation while KM exploitation mediates both leadership and HR practices on innovation. Recommendations This paper serves as a guide for R&D managers to determine the gaps and apfor Practitioners propriate actions to collectively achieve the desired R&D results and national innovation. It helps R&D firms frame their KM activities to enhance the capability of creating and retaining a greater value to their core business competencies. Recommendations This paper contributes significantly to knowledge management and innovation for Researchers research by establishing new associations among KM-centred strategies, i.e., leadership, HR practices, and culture, both KM practices (knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation), and innovation. Impact on Society This paper highlights the important role of knowledge leaders and the practice of effective HR practices to help R&D firms to create a positive environment that facilitates both knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation in enhancing innovation capabilities. Future Research Further research could use a longitudinal sample to examine relationships of causality, offering a more comprehensive view of the effect of KM factors on innovation over the long term. Future research should also try to incorporate information from new external sources, such as customers or suppliers. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2022 Informing Science Institute.

From the point of view of operations management, authors developed a Conceptual Framework (CF) to support DT implementation in Discrete Manufacturing Industries (DMI). The CF applies knowledge management, hybrid project management (HPM) and Sociotechnical values to implement DT, using New Product Development (NPD) as a ground. The work aims to depict the HPM approach of this CF. Design /Methodology /Approach: this is a qualitative research based on a systematic literature review carried out over a period of five years. It was performed in the Web of Science database, applying PRISMA flowchart, to evaluate which project management models, addressed in the literature, are more suitable for DT implementation projects in light of sociotechnical and innovation-shared-values approach. Results: A Hybrid Stage-Gate - Agile - Design Thinking project management model to support DT implementation in DMI. This is a preliminary proposal that can be explored in future empirical research.

Moreover, research on differences in innovation between men and women showed inconclusive results. Ambidexterity (Bledow, Frese, Anderson, Erez, & Farr, 2009) and Zhou and Hoever (2014) call for combining contextual and personal characteristics in innovation research suggest that pathways and variables leading to innovation between men and women could be different. Objective(s). - This study aims to analyze if men and women differ in the main antecedents for innovative behaviors. Thus, a moderating effect of gender on the relationship between innovative behaviors and their main antecedent variables is hypothesized. Results are of interest for promoting innovation and empowering women at work context. Method. - In a sample of 458 employees from 16 Spanish companies, we carried out hierarchical regression analyses on innovation behaviors, including as main antecedents academic level, proactive personality, job demands, organizational commitment, HR practices addressed to participation, and transformational leadership. In addition, interaction terms between gender and such antecedents were entered in regression analysis. Results. - Proactive personality, HR participation practices, inspirational motivation, job demands and academic level significantly predicted innovative behaviors at their different phases. Moreover, gender moderated the relationship between generation of new ideas with academic level and organizational commitment, and between promotion of ideas with job demands and idealized influence. Organizational commitment promoted generation of ideas among women but not among men, whereas idealized influence is detrimental for women. Reversely, higher job demands stimulate promotion of ideas among men but were detrimental for innovation among women. Conclusion. - Our results suggest that innovation among women seems to be more sensitive to the influence of leadership and require more social support, whereas higher job demands are detrimental. These results suggest that innovation is more related to intrinsic variables (as self-confidence, empowerment and social processes) among women, whereas for men, it seems to be more related to work demands. Results could help companies to stimulate innovation, between both men and women. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The landscape for entrepreneurial initiatives has changed over the last years, and a growing number of Open Innovation Platforms (OIPs hereafter) entered the global arena as significant tools to help companies in leveraging new knowledge from the people (West and Bogers, 2014; De Falco et al., 2017). In recent years, several scholars have approached OIPs in order to explore their dynamics, and most of them focused on knowledge-based practices, platforms services and motivations of collaboration between participants (Frey et al., 2011; Kathan et al., 2014; Battistella and Nonino, 2012, 2013; De Falco et al., 2017; Randhawa et al., 2017; De Silva et al., 2018; Matricano et al., 2019). OIPs are a typical example of two-sided platforms as they connect two groups of users and operate as intermediaries (Belleflamme and Peitz, 2018). Two types of users populate the virtual OIPs on the demand side and the supply side (Troise et al., 2020): innovation seekers (the proponents of initiatives who launch online challenges) and backers (the innovators or problem solvers who support the initiatives and contribute to solve a challenge by sending their ideas). Despite the spread of OIPs and the growing interest by scholars and practitioners, only few studies have explored the successful drivers that lead initiatives to get superior performance through the online challenge (Troise et al., 2020). In this specific emerging research stream, little is known about the role of social capital in the success of these initiatives within OIPs. The aim of this study is to fill this gap by investigating the role of social capital in the success of online challenges within OIPs. Since social capital is a multidimensional concept, we consider the effects of its three main dimensions: cognitive, relational and structural ( Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998; Liu et al., 2010; Zheng et al., 2014). In line with the prior study of Zheng et al. (2014) who analyzed these three dimensions in the context of reward-crowdfunding platforms, we consider: shared meaning (i.e. the length of the description of initiatives posted on the OIP) as an expression of the cognitive dimension; obligation (i.e. the number of others' initiatives who the proponents of the challenge supported before the launch of their own initiative) as an expression of the relational dimension; social network ties (i.e. the number of proponents' friends on their main social networks, e.g. Facebook and LinkedIn) as an expression of the structural dimension. Based on the above, we propose the following theoretical framework (Figure 1) in order to explore the effects of social capital on the performance of online initiatives launched on OIPs. Figure 1. Theoretical Framework [GRAPHICS] We propose that social capital - i.e. cognitive dimension (H1), relational dimension (H2) and structural dimension (H3) - positively influences the performance of the initiatives launched on OIPs. Following the prior study of Troise et al. (2020), we consider two main parameters as proxies of initiatives' success: the number of ideas submitted at the end of the online call and the number of final backers involved. This research is a work in progress. We are collecting data from four main well-known OIPs (since their origin up to 2019): Opeindeo, Openinnovation-suedtirol, Guerra-creativa and Crowdspring. At the end of the data-collection we will have about 600 initiatives as final sample. In order to test the impact of social capital on initiatives' performance we will run two regression models (negative binomial or zero-inflated negative binomial regression as the two dependent variables are count parameters) in order to capture its effects on the final number of ideas (Model 1) and the number of backers (Model 2). We expect a positive impact of the three factors on both the initiatives' outcomes. The results of this research will add new knowledge in a nascent research stream and - hopefully will have both theoretical and practical implications for several stakeholders, in particular innovation seekers (especially companies and entrepreneurs), backers, platform managers and policy makers.",2020,Conference Paper,,C3,4,2016,Journal,0,0,0,0.179237688,0.075180677,0.115059266,0,0,0,0.651847589,0,0,0,0,0.076574112,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.012059173,0,0,0,0,0,0.227308969,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.097358607,0,0.039040525,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0790316,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.091597912,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.041072015,0,0,0,0,0,0.101008009,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.081194419,0,0.109280174,0,0,0.558726505,0.239977825,0,0.128567487,0,0.066848171,0,0.092609547,0.104865144,0,0,,,,1,1,1,1,,,,1,3

However, none have been highly satisfying in lessening the impact of disasters. The significant factor for the limited success of modern scientific society is that it views the world from a temporal perspective where humans are believed to be an active agent in modifying every natural possibility into opportunity. The very composite environmental system is simplified whilst extracting resources, resulting in resource depletion and environmental degradation, consequently opening the door for disaster. Technocratic science must recognise the need for a relational or holistic approach rather than believing in reductionist approaches alone whilst dealing with natural calamities. In this context, the knowledge of traditional societies is important to fill up the existing gaps created by the modern society. Traditional knowledge has different sets of ingredients to foster the development of the relational or holistic approach as it involves, interacts and interconnects humans, non-humans (animals and plants) and nature together, setting a perfect balance for sustainable development and DRR. It has vast undocumented observational data of changing natural phenomena, and in today's scenario of climate change and uncertainty, it can create a path for reliable adaptation measures from climate-induced disasters. Thus, a holistic approach is needed for comprehensive DRR measures where both scientific and traditional knowledge systems can work together. The main purpose of this article was to explore the effective ingredients of traditional knowledge in DRR and how this age-old wisdom can be offered a hand to its integration into and collaboration with scientific research and management for DRR. To fulfil the objectives, a theoretical desk study approach was followed by identifying relevant studies, highlighting traditional knowledge in DRR from empirical and grey literatures, archive materials, biblical stories and so on.

The mechanisms for PC technology adoption have yet to be defined, which inhibits its diffusion in the construction market. This study aims to reveal the intrinsic motivation and action mechanism for PC technology adoption. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on the technology acceptance model (TAM), the study integrates characteristics from the diffusion of innovation theory to propose a multifaceted model for explaining practitionersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ PC technology adoption behavior from technology, organization and environment contexts. The proposed theoretical model was empirically examined via a survey of 234 professionals in mainland China using the partial least squares-structural equation modeling technique. Findings: The outcomes indicated that relative advantage, corporate social responsibility and market demand are significantly positively related to practitionersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ perceived usefulness from PC technology. Regulatory support and trading partner support have noticeable positive effects on practitionersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ perceived ease of use from PC technology. Perceived ease of use is found to positively influence perceived usefulness, and both of them have a positive influence on the attitude toward adopting PC technology. Attitude is further confirmed as an important predictor of adoption intention, which would lead to actual PC technology adoption behavior.

Design/methodology: In this study, main arguments from intellectual capital, strategic human resource management (SHRM) and multilevel literature are integrated. The intellectual capital literature provides our model with the input (human capital), mechanisms (social capital) and the infrastructure (organizational capital) required to create ambidextrous capabilities. The multilevel perspective reveals the context in which ambidexterity is reached, and the SHRM provide the model with the specific mechanisms (policies and practices) and conditions required by ambidexterity (HRM flexibility and horizontal fit). Findings: Although the literature widely recognizes ambidexterity as a potential source of sustainable competitive advantage, the processes by which organizations complement exploration and exploitation activities still remain unclear. This study sheds some light on the analysis of these complex dynamics, explaining how ambidextrous capabilities can arise from different alternative combinations of human, social and organizational capital.

Design/methodology/approach: This empirical study is based on hotel-level information from a survey including 131 hotels in 2014. Colombia was chosen as a representative of Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey and South Africa (CIVETS) emerging destinations. The relationships were analyzed by structural modeling and partial least squares. Findings: Clustering has a positive direct impact on hotel competitiveness and innovation, and there is a positive effect of innovation on competitiveness. Therefore, the link between clustering and competitiveness is partially mediated through implementation of management innovations. Practical implications: Hotels should actively participate in agglomerated destinations and build relationships with established firms by clustering. Interaction with related firms and implementation of management innovations will lead to increased levels of economic competitiveness. Public policymakers should foster collaborative strategic networking in the hospitality industry of emerging economy destinations. Originality/value: This paper focused on separating the direct and indirect effects of clustering on hotel competitiveness. Implementation of management innovations was considered as an outcome derived from clustering in emerging tourist destinations, using the example of Colombia. Clustering stimulates and eases management innovations within the location, and that combination reinforces the role that cooperating while competing plays in hotel competitiveness for destinations with lagging innovation.

To do so, we collected data of 15 established companies and employed fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to derive the specific configurations that ultimately lead to success.

The organizational responses are quite heterogeneous even when the firms face similar pressure. The authors have tried to explain this heterogeneity by using innovative capability as mediating variables. Design/methodology/approach: Empirical survey data from Indian manufacturing firms are obtained to test the proposed hypotheses. The hypotheses are grounded in resource-based view of the firm. The authors used structural equation modeling approach with maximum likelihood methods of approximation. Findings: The results indicate that exploratory innovation positively influences the firms to adopt CE practices. Whereas, exploitative innovation capability inhibits the adoption of CE practices. Practical implications: This study guides business managers to focus on develop exploratory innovative capabilities before the adoption of CE practices. This study also provides guidance to policy maker about the role of regulatory mechanism plays to encourage/inhibits firms for adoption of CE practices. Originality/value: This is first study to analyze the idiosyncratic behavior of the firms when subjected to stakeholder pressure for CE practices adoption. Innovative capabilities (exploratory/exploitative) are able to explain the reason for diverse response to stakeholder response.

Accounting for the differences in knowledge dimensions and knowledge interactions, catching-up firms are provided with different types of learning opportunities. In the context of catch-up of emerging economy firms, the empirical evidence considering these differences is rather scarce. Using a cross-section of European patent data, we investigate the effects of different types of international knowledge interactions on the quality of knowledge captured by Chinese firmsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ patent applications. We differentiate between lower vs. higher levels of learning and explore the technological learning process of Chinese firms over a period of 15 years. We find that international knowledge interactions are associated positively with knowledge quality. In the earlier phases of the catch-up process, knowledge interactions providing lower levels of learning are associated with a higher quality of the knowledge generated. Whereas knowledge interactions with the opportunity for higher levels of learning are correlated with a higher quality of the generated knowledge in later phases of the catch-up process.

However, the findings suggest that the causal mechanisms of this link are not yet fully understood. Further work is therefore considered necessary in this regard. This study contributes to this field with an exploratory investigation. The purpose is to extend our understanding of how such practices can improve innovation outcomes, based on the experiences of professionals from leading innovating companies. A qualitative methodology has been applied, comprising successive application of in-depth personal interviews and the Delphi technique. The results suggest that three of the instruments that make a major contribution are leadership style, an innovation-friendly culture and the creation of work teams to find solutions to customer needs.

The authors investigate how the Chinese guanxi is utilized to create and develop service exploitation and exploration activities for adopting non-technological innovations. Design/methodology/approach: This study surveyed 252 Chinese and Taiwanese firms. The results were analyzed through structural equation model. Findings: Relational antecedents of collaborative communication and constructive conflict positively relate to trust, as well as to relationship effectiveness. Constructive conflict positively relates to exploration and exploitation. Relationship effectiveness and trust mediate two relational antecedents to exploitation. Relationship effectiveness crucially mediates two relational antecedents to exploration. Research limitations/implications: Dyadic data would be more desirable to study firm interactions. Practical implications: Chinese society perceives conflict as being detrimental to relationships. Constructive conflict enhances inter-firm trust and relationship effectiveness. Relationship effectiveness, which motivates suppliers to mobilize their guanxi network, mediates the supplierÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“customer interaction in broadening relationships to produce new services, as well as reinforcing networks to strengthen existing ventures. Originality/value: This study contributes to a relatively under-explored relationship effectiveness area.

In this context, emerging-market SMEs could learn and innovate by imitating and reverse engineering successful products. This study explored the key characteristics on innovative and internationalization efforts reported to SMEs companies at a wide geographical and sectorial coverage. In this research context, the managerial constraints, the entrepreneurial challenges, and the future prospects of SMEs have been systematically reviewed and discussed in alignment with their innovation and internationalization perspectives offered from the side of circular economy (CE).

In particular, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of staff engagement as a facilitator of staff-led value co-creation. Design/methodology/approach - A new conceptual framework develops a model of staff-led value-creation, using three types of staff-led co-creation. A quantitative approach is used. Survey collection yielded a sample of 1,165 employees in an Australian not-for-profit context across 19 organizations. AMOS structural equation modeling analyzes the data. Findings - A major finding is the nexus between staff engagement and staff-led value co-creation. The nexus applies for three types of staff-led co-creation and three staff categories. Different explanatory mechanisms apply to each type of staff-led value co-creation. Research limitations/implications - The not-for-profit context may not generalize to the for-profit sector, but future research could clarify this matter. Practical implications - The results can inform organizations wishing to create greater service contributions through greater staff participation, which can include a staff-initiating (staff-led) role. Different value co-creation targets require different corporate triggers, reflecting the different explanatory mechanisms of each co-creation type. Social implications - Not-for-profit context ensures major social implications. Originality/value - The emphasis on staff-led value co-creation augments the customer-led co-creation literature.

However, many developing countries suffer from simultaneously ineffective IS-GVC learning channels. Based on comparative case research of key cacao-chocolate firms in the Philippines, this study provides evidence that latecomer firms build functional upgrading capabilities directly through global knowledge networks and indirectly through market-based chain buyers in weak IS-GVC contexts.

Using the mirroring hypothesis as a point of departure to understand existing and emerging innovation networks, we recognize anarchistic actions. The analysis reveals the emergence of anarchic actions and how they challenge well-established federative innovation networks within the organization. With continued focus on technology, the project and organization disregarded necessary social structure development, which resulted in reduced capabilities to utilize the digitalized service. This qualitative paper also illustrates how the mirroring hypothesis, although originating from product innovation literature, can be used to understand digitalization dynamics.

Current research acknowledges the lack of representation of women in STEM and reports on challenges and barriers to recruiting, retaining, and advancing women in these fields. Engineering educators recognise the need for the profession to diversify, to be more inclusive, and that innovation and entrepreneurial mindsets are required for engineering leaders in the future. Traditional career ladders are dissolving and we understand better the new models of boundaryless and protean (self-directed and values-driven) careers that span across work units, organisations and sectors, including self-employment. The future of engineering education requires learning designers to better understand how to develop the mindsets required for orienteering the many transitions in the careers of the future. If we are to support the careers of women in STEM we need to understand the nature of their career paths and choices. This qualitative research used semi-structured interviews to explore the career narratives of women in STEM, focusing on the career decision making and individual perceptions of career choices associated with career shifts or pivots. With reference to the literature on career choice, mindsets and motivations, an inductive and thematic analysis was conducted and descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data. We looked at the career paths of women in STEM in terms of their career patterns, locus of control, career context, career age and stage, career sponsorship, and their experiences in entrepreneurial ventures. A framework has been developed for characterising and understanding women's choices and the mindsets that enable success. This framework will enable us to identify approaches and tools that are useful for women to evaluate their own mindsets and design their career choices. The results can be used to inform the design of resources and interventions that support the retainment and advancement of women in STEM, developing an intentional change mindset, and supporting career choices from undergraduate level to continuous professional development education. This new framework for career development is emerging and integrates knowledge from educational research and professional experience of women to enable educators, coaches, people managers, and human resource professionals to better prepare women and organisations for the future of work.",2021,Conference Paper,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637159,C14,1,2021,Journal,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.113290464,0,0.054954761,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.233518599,0,0,0,0,0,0.024928912,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.778562094,0.123864408,0,0.100630618,0,0.020176296,0,0,0,0.054954761,0,0,0,0.16337536,0,0,0.178075318,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.105001442,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.069590461,0,0,0.258248866,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.060464197,0,0,0.225905687,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.089670178,0,0.108389434,0.280172546,0,1,,,1,,,1,,,,1,6

However, China lags behind developed countries in terms of its OSC development. The chief goal of this study is to demonstrate the critical driving forces and solutions that promote OSC development. A total of 21 hypotheses are established to present the interrelations among eight driving forces. Based on 176 valid responses from developers in mainland China, a structural equation model is built to explore the key solutions and the critical driving forces. Most driving forces, such as Pursuit of Sustainable Competitiveness (PSC), Governmental Policies and Regulations (GPR), Technological Innovation (TI), Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), and Construction Market Demand (CMD), can affect a Corporation's Willingness and Behavior (CWB) in adopting OSC through two mediating factors, namely, Economic Benefits (EB) and social and environmental benefits. The findings highlight five main driving solutions to promote OSC, namely, PSC -> EB -> CWB, PSC -> TI -> EB -> CWB, GPR -> TI -> EB -> CWB, GPR -> CSR -> CWB, and GPR -> CMD -> CWB.

However, model uncertainty can increase with model complexity and affect the variance of the model outcomes. Therefore, this study explores an uncertainty analysis of coupled hydrological and human decision models to better evaluate CNHS modeling properties. Five coupled models are proposed with different model complexities for human behavior settings (i.e., model structure and the number of calibrated parameters): one static, two adaptive, and two learning adaptive. Learning adaptive models (the most complex) have both a learning component (capturing long-term trends) and an adaptive component (capturing short-term variations), while adaptive models omit the learning component. The static model is the simplest, without learning or adaptive components. Applying the law of total variance, the model output uncertainty is decomposed into three sources: (a) climate change scenario uncertainty, (b) climate internal variability, and (c) different model configurations with parameter sets or model structures that are equally capable of producing similar outcomes. Our exploratory analysis demonstrated that model uncertainty would likely increase with model complexity given uncertain input data (e.g., climate forcing) and different model configurations; the inclusion of a learning mechanism in the human system can potentially offset the impact of the natural system on uncertainty through coupling natural and human systems. We also discuss other uncertainty sources, such as assumptions about model structure due to incomplete knowledge and metrics for calibration target selection for future studies.",2022,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021EF002403,C11,1,2017,Journal,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.093988306,0,0,0,0,0.019998802,0,0,0.166558013,0,0,0.188483363,0,0,0,0.156147101,0,0,0,0,0.097116573,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.505413893,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.310763743,0,0,0.14081403,0,0,0,0.168471298,0,0,0,0,0.181229054,0,0,0.617723978,0,0,0,0,0.110860281,0.143872798,0.153582668,0,0.149842489,0,,,,1,1,,,,,,1,6

Still, there are shortcomings in this approach associated with a quantitative and generic methodology, a static notion of relatedness, and a weakly developed policy and institutional perspective. In particular, there is a need for a better understanding of the mechanisms through which relatedness is developed and how policy affects existing and emerging relatedness. Certain mechanisms for knowledge transfer have been suggested, such as labour mobility, firm diversification, spin-offs and social networks. But do the same mechanisms apply to all industries and in all territories, or are there specific mechanisms of knowledge sourcing at work in different contexts? To shed light on these questions, the article reports on a comparative case study of two knowledge-intensive industries (life science and publishing) located in the Oslo metropolitan region. Based on a case study, the article suggests that both industries source knowledge through similar types of channels.

With the aim of filling this gap, we explored the case of Sony PlayStation by adopting a qualitative approach. All the innovations that were identified were coded in terms of value creation and value capture mechanisms.

Our findings were finally discussed to highlight novel insights about the innovations implemented by Sony, that can be beneficial for both scholars and practitioners.

The authors also examined the moderating role of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and engagement in social interaction on the relationship between PTOs and knowledge sharing. Design/methodology/approach: The study employed a survey method to collect the data and tested the proposed hypotheses by using the partial structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) technique. Data is based on 815 responses across all sectors in the country context of the UAE. Findings: The study findings indicate that PTOs are positively related to knowledge sharing. Notably, the results show that the proposed relationship between PTOs and knowledge sharing is negatively and significantly moderated by intrinsic motivation. Moreover, the moderating roles of extrinsic motivation and engagement in social interaction were insignificant. Originality/value: At a theoretical level, this article provides an individual-level analysis, which indicates that PTOs pave the way for intraorganizational knowledge sharing; hence, they offer insights into the mechanisms in which PTOs impact on knowledge sharing. This article also contributes to our general understanding on human resource management (HRM) practices and knowledge sharing in the context of the emerging economy of the UAE; the latter has a number of implications for both theory and practice as delineated in this study.

Background With the advent of the era of the knowledge economy, knowledge has been replacing traditional resources such as capital, labor, and land to become the critical resources of enterprises. The competitiveness of an organization depends much on the effectiveness of its knowledge management; the success of its knowledge management largely relies upon employeesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ motivation and willingness to engage in knowledge sharing. Methodology This study is a longitudinal analysis of data collected from 281 newcomers in Chinese enterprises at two-time points with a one-month interval. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was conducted to test hypotheses by calculating standardized path coefficients and their significance levels. Contribution The study examined models linking organizational socialization and knowledge sharing that included organizational links and sacrifice as mediators and trust as a moderator. Findings Results show that the influences of organizational socialization on knowledge sharing change regularly over time. In the role management stage, coworker support and prospects for the future impact the practices of knowledge sharing through links and sacrifice. Moreover, the findings show that trust moderates the effect of links and sacrifice on employeesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ knowledge sharing. Recommendations This study can help enterprises develop targeted human resource manage-for Practitioners ment strategies, improve the degree of job embeddedness within the organization, and thus encourage more knowledge sharing among employees. Recommendations First, researchers could pay attention to more underlying mechanisms and for Researchers boundary conditions in the relationship between organizational socialization and knowledge sharing. Second, focusing on specific cultural context and dimension of concepts may provide a new insight for the future study and help add greater theoretical precision to knowledge sharing. Impact on Society First, this study suggests that coworker support and prospects for the future improve knowledge sharing within the organization. Second, understanding how job embeddedness (organizational links and organizational sacrifice) acts as a mediator enhancing knowledge sharing, managers should consider raising their attachment relationship to organizations from two aspects: links and sacrifice. Third, knowledge sharing takes place in a team-oriented context, where the success of the team requires high-quality relationships among individual team members within the team as a whole. Future Research Researchers in the future should employ experimental research design or utilize longitudinal data to ensure that the findings reveal causation. In addition, future research can investigate how the initial level and later changes of organizational socialization are associated with knowledge sharing beyond the observational scope of traditional cross-sectional and lagged research designs.

The present study posits that the international explorative capabilities of these ESMEs enable them to transform knowledge from external network resources into innovation performance. We collected data from 204 China-based ESMEs and analyzed these data using structural equation modeling. Findings demonstrate that international learning intent and breadth of international network positively affect ESMEs' own explorative capability and thus innovation performance.

We refer to these approaches, all of which aim to support the design of farming systems, as 'farmer innovation tracking'. There is still a lack of knowledge, however, about the specificities of the approaches adopted to track innovations and how they contribute to design processes. To explore these questions, we studied 14 initiatives in France led by actors from different R&D networks. We analysed the data collected using agronomy and design science concepts. Three outcomes emerge from this work. (1) We shed light on the common features of innovation tracking. We outline five stages that structure all the approaches: formulating an innovation tracking project, unearthing innovations, learning about them, analysing them, and generating agronomic content. (2) We characterize six contributions of farmer innovation tracking to design processes: giving rise to creative anomalies, shedding light on systemic mechanisms to fuel design processes on other farms, uncovering research questions, stimulating design in orphan fields of innovation, circulating innovation concepts, and connecting farmer-designers with each other. (3) Finally, we highlight three tracking strategies: the targeted tracking of proven practices, the targeted tracking of innovations under development, and the exploratory tracking of proven practices. This article is the first to propose a theorization of the farmer innovation tracking approaches, thus enriching the agronomic foundations supporting farming system design. The purpose of our paper is not to provide a turnkey method, but to highlight concepts, mechanisms, and points of reference for actors who might wish to develop farmer innovation tracking in different contexts in the future.

The model incorporates three essential characteristics of knowledge that have not been covered entirely by previous diffusion models: the network character of knowledge, compatibility of new knowledge with already existing knowledge, and the fact that transmission of knowledge requires some form of attention. We employ a network-of- networks approach, where agents are located within an innovation network and each agent itself contains another network composed of knowledge units (KUs). Since social learning is a path-dependent process, in our model, KUs are exchanged among agents and integrated into their respective knowledge networks depending on the received KUs' compatibility with the currently focused ones. Thereby, we are also able to endogenize attributes such as absorptive capacity that have been treated as an exogenous parameter in some of the previous diffusion models. We use our model to simulate and analyze various scenarios, including cases for different degrees of knowledge diversity and cognitive distance among agents as well as knowledge exploitation vs. exploration strategies. Here, the model is able to distinguish between two levels of knowledge diversity: heterogeneity within and between agents. Additionally, our simulation results give fresh impetus to debates about the interplay of innovation network structure and knowledge diffusion. In summary, our article proposes a novel way of modeling knowledge diffusion, thereby contributing to an advancement of the economics of innovation and knowledge.",2018,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00191-018-0579-z,C13,8,2019,Article,0,0.12515299,0,0,0.172201161,0.131771488,0.125527077,0,0.121780955,0,0,0,0.116676613,0.138120229,0,0,0,0,0,0.39048799,0,0,0.027621508,0.111813457,0.050382812,0.115021476,0,0,0,0.094429558,0,0,0,0,0.096983176,0.445999314,0,0.022355557,0,0,0.112762019,0,0,0,0.112128358,0,0,0.063039921,0,0.119054747,0.086553194,0,0,0.092200993,0,0,0.187359143,0.074782344,0,0,0,0.165575148,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.135092764,0.143071289,0,0,0.291729661,0,0.075173393,0.061217312,0,0.058324194,0.066994993,0.046493906,0.139374781,0,0.10016272,0.122583672,0,0,0.119400507,0.073620881,0.24578243,0,0,0,0,0,0.281786288,1,,,,,1,,,,,,6

Specifically, it considers the relationships between sourcing knowledge from an external environment, transferring knowledge to an external environment and adopting solutions that are useful to appropriate returns from innovation. Design/methodology/approach This study analyzes the connection between the number of patent applications and the amount of OI, as well as the association between the number of patent applications and the use of BDA. Data from firms in the 27 European Union countries were retrieved from the Eurostat database for the period 2014-2019 and were investigated using an ordinary least squares regression analysis. Findings Because of its twofold lens based on both knowledge management and OI, this study sheds light on OI collaboration modes and highlights the crucial role they could play in innovation. In particular, the results suggest that OI collaboration modes have a strong effect on innovation performance, stimulating the search for RKE.

Design/methodology/approach This research used the quantitative method and structural equation modeling approach to examine hypotheses with data obtained by the survey from 280 participants in 85 Pakistani firms. Findings The findings of this study indicate that the KMP significantly mediates between collaborative culture and two specific types of innovation, namely radical innovation and incremental innovation. In addition, the ownership form can serve as a moderator in the relationship between KMP and innovation capability. Research limitations/implications Future research should explore the moderating impact of other strategic or behavioral factors, such as self-efficacy, job experience, education level, optimism and organizational support, to better clarify the association between these latent constructs.

For enterprises, continuous innovation capabilities can effectively deal with uncertainties in the business environment and can enhance business competitiveness. Macropolicies can stimulate economic development and can try to promote enterprise innovation, but there is still widespread debate in academia about whether these policies successfully promote or, in fact, inhibit innovation. Looking at the provincial panel data from China between 2009 and 2018, the authors of this paper explored the complex nonlinear mechanism of government R&D investment in driving regional innovation capabilities from the perspective of knowledge accumulation. The empirical results show that, when the level of knowledge accumulation is used as the threshold variable, there is an obvious threshold effect between government R&D input and regional innovation capabilities. As the level of knowledge accumulation crosses the threshold, the influence of government R&D investment on regional innovation capabilities undergoes a structural mutation, shifting from an insignificant inhibitory effect to a significant promotional effect. The above conclusion has strong robustness.

Five propositions relating to charisma, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, individualized consideration, and Indian ambidextrous leadership are developed. We show that the seven cultural variables characterizing Indian ambidextrous leadership (nurturant, personal touch, expertise, simple living and high thinking, loyalty, self-sacrifice, and the giving model of motivation) reinforce the recent successful internationalization by Indian companies.

An in-depth exploration of its sudden success reveals three distinctive features of this new business model, namely web search engine, proliferation of smart handhelds and user-generated reputation feedback mechanisms. All of these technological innovations not only inflict destructive changes to our social structure, but also lead to difficulties in an automatic inclusion of the sharing economy into the current regulatory framework. Two changes have raised particular attention. First, sharing platforms are capable of building a democratized private trust mechanism, in addition to the traditional government-monopolized public licensing system. Second, the vertical disintegration feature of the sharing economy considerably blurs the borderline between business and consumers, and between employers and employees. For the purpose of establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework for all online and offline activities, it is necessary to differentiate the sharing economy into those with offline competitors and those without offline competitors. With regard to the former, regulators are encouraged to embrace the sharing economy and meanwhile deregulate offline competitors. In relation to the latter, a three-condition analytical framework is proposed in order to strike a balance between promoting innovation and protecting the existing rights of others.

Our paper allows for a deeper understanding of the key decisions and choices related to the business model of entrepreneurial universities in the area of vocational education and identifies three business model patterns that universities can apply to extend their traditional business models and embark on an evolutionary path to satisfy the necessity of independently generating funds. Thus, this research not only sheds light on entrepreneurial activities carried out by universities in general, it also goes deeper by showing how these activities shape the business model.",2018,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1504/IJTM.2018.091716,C15,2,2022,Article,0,0,0.287010618,0,0.091749561,0,0,0.147182171,0,0.113643811,0,0.134163355,0.248663318,0.147182171,0,0.106159887,0,0,0,0.554810067,0,0,0.02943373,0.476597744,0.053688382,0.12256793,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.214400564,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.12686582,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.123975892,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.145323311,0.115545406,0,0,0.050123776,0.054777276,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.065233724,0,0,0.071390474,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.127234265,0,0,0.16316135,0,0,0.127976115,0.110267188,0.100091343,1,,,,,,,,,1,1,12

The adaptive cycle framework may help explain change and the long term dynamics and resilience in supply chain networks. Adaptive cycles assume that dynamic systems such as supply chain networks go through stages of growth, development, collapse and reorientation. Adaptive cycles suggest that the resilience of a complex adaptive system such as supply chains are not fixed but expand and contract over time and resilience requires such systems to navigate each of the cycles' four stages successfully. Design/methodology/approach This research uses the adaptive cycle framework to explain supply chain resilience (SCRES). It explores the phases of the adaptive cycle, its pathologies and key properties and links these to competences and behaviors that are important for system and SCRES. The study develops a conceptual framework linking adaptive cycles to SCRES. The goal is to extend dynamic theories of SCRES by borrowing from the adaptive cycle framework. We review the literature on the adaptive cycle framework, its properties and link these to SCRES. Findings The key insight is that the adaptive cycle concept can broaden our understanding of SCRES beyond focal scales, including cross-scale resilience. As a framework, the adaptive cycle can explain the mechanisms that support or prevent resilience in supply chains. Adaptive cycles may also give us new insights into the sort of competences required to avoid stagnation, promote system renewal as resilience expands and contracts over time. Research limitations/implications The adaptive cycle may move our discussion of resilience beyond engineering and ecological resilience to include evolutionary resilience. While the first two presently dominates our theorizing on SCRES, evolutionary resilience may be more insightful than both are. Adaptive cycles capture the idea of change, adaptation and transformation and allow us to explore cross-scale resilience. Practical implications Knowing how to prepare for and overcoming key pathologies associated with each stage of the adaptive cycle can broaden our repertoire of strategies for managing SCRES across time. Human agency is important for preventing systems from crossing critical thresholds into imminent collapse. More importantly, disruptions may present an opportunity for innovation and renewal for building more resilience supply chains. Originality/value This research is one of the few studies that have applied the adaptive cycle concept to SCRES and extends our understanding of the dynamic structure of SCRES",2020,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJLM-01-2020-0019,C11,1,2021,Article,0.247134801,0,0.125118377,0,0,0,0.34987243,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.128324133,0,0.185115838,0.120195053,0,0.098810292,0,0,0.099631374,0.012831234,0,0.046809441,0,0.107168583,0,0,0,0.095616369,0,0.601104015,0,0,0,0.12551139,0.08308001,0,0,0,0.113143713,0,0,0.10417572,0.084091417,0,0,0.061105118,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.087035403,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.058257999,0,0.100740898,0,0,0,0.023879409,0,0,0,0,0,0.090346302,0.09719565,0,0,0,0.054187585,0,0,0,0,0.093058738,0.455557991,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.092308808,0,0,0,0.087266921,1,,,,,,,,,1,1,12

The paper argues that companies engaged in such activities will find that there is a significant gap in precisely what aspects of the formal and informal institutional perspectives need to be identified and assessed for international expansion. The purpose of this paper is to develop a theoretical paradigm that allows organizations not only to compare different countries with regard to their potential for international business expansion from the perspective of Institutional Theory but also drawing on theories of International Business Strategy where relevant. The theoretical framework assumes that such organizations are engaged in analyzing the institutional arrangements and resources of their home and possible host countries. The paper then develops a conceptual framework that identifies five major components, namely people, power, performance, pathways to international expansion, and productivity, the latter being defined in terms of knowledge and innovation. It explores each of these areas in more depth with the aim of adding a more detailed structure to elements of Institutional Theory relevant to international business expansion.

Yet little is known about the processes through which social innovation occurs and how context shapes them. To date, scholarship has focused primarily on social entrepreneurs and social enterprise creation, while the role of established not-for-profits (NFPs) as agents of social innovation has received surprisingly little attention given their importance to communities. It is expected that innovation will be increasingly important for NFPs as shifts in their funding models create greater complexity in maintaining sustainability and continuity in social service delivery. This research generates a deeper understanding of the processes of social innovation within NFPs by examining how multiple levels of context influence the behaviors of a key set of agents: innovation champions. Adopting an interactionist lens, the study explores how shifts in funding policy at the macro level, and the role of leaders (CEOs and Boards) and organizational institutional logics at the meso level, influence champion behavior at the micro level. To do this, we draw on sensemaking as an important cognitive and action-enabling mechanism. A qualitative, multicase study design with 46 interviews across six case organizations allows an in-depth exploration of this under-investigated area. The findings indicate that bricolage activity can facilitate championing that supports social innovation within NFPs and that organizational context guides the direction and content of champion behavior. The findings further uncover a broader range of behaviors and outcomes than have been previously attributed to champions, while highlighting the critical role that bricolage-enabled championing can play in driving social innovation that is both directly impactful and offers significant longer-term social impact. The important roles that sensebreaking, sensegiving, and sensemaking play in connecting champions' interpretations of their contexts to their behaviors are also outlined.",2020,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpim.12527,C4,6,2022,Journal,0.067018157,0,0.067859346,0,0.043385609,0,0,0,0.061364754,0.161216224,0,0,0,0,0.044189739,0,0.130378252,0.065411912,0,0.06558825,0.05602675,0.216144744,0.013918326,0,0.025387622,0,0.058124075,0,0,0.142747605,0,0.069376415,0,0,0,0,0,0.123913265,0,0,0,0.030682377,0,0,0.056500863,0.091215835,0,0,0.066282083,0.179973096,0.043613678,0,0,0.046459573,0,0,0,0.037682412,0.703493662,0,0.113047235,0.041716203,0.055713838,0,0,0.06319375,0,0.163913846,0,0,0.023702027,0.064756318,0.063252404,0.068072501,0.432557012,0,0,0,0,0.037879459,0.030847067,0,0,0.033758409,0.023428023,0,0,0.100942887,0,0,0.017310938,0.060165258,0.074194314,0.08256561,0.038577048,0,0.053443541,0.060516057,0,0,1,,,1,1,1,1,,,1,,13

These capabilities then facilitate suppliers in climbing the value chain from B-to-B to B-to-C. Design/methodology/approach The study adopted a longitudinal and multiple case study design to examine the practices of suppliers operating in a traditional emerging economy setting. This study selected Pakistan textile industry as an empirical setting, which is a predominantly supplier market for global buyers. Data sources entail semi-structured interviews with top executives and senior-level managers in four case firms and secondary data obtained from diverse sources. Findings The study identified transitionary phases of capabilities development that are facilitated by boundary-spanning knowledge acquisition and transformation in a dynamic manner. These capabilities are essential for a supplier's entry into downstream international markets (i.e. launching its own products/brands in the end consumers' market). Practical implications The findings could help managers in STEEs to understand the strategic importance of supply chain ties in their learning and capabilities development. It also provides strategic insights on what, how and why involved parties do engage over an extended period of time. Moreover, the findings of this study could help other firms to know and adopt the right type of technology(s) and systems that can help them reduce the technological gap in producing and marketing market-winning products. Originality/value This study advances the recent academic discussion that focusses on learning by supplying and the value-chain movement of suppliers (i.e. B-to-C) from their B-to-B engagements. The findings identified the vital and beneficial role of long-term relationships with global value chain partners in learning and capabilities development that led to value creation in the traditional emerging economy.",2021,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/SCM-12-2021-0551,C2,6,2020,Journal,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.178805215,0,0,0,0,0.179340659,0,0,0,0,0,0.092454912,0.151493464,0,0,0,0.019672527,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.158824305,0,0.286596427,0,0,0,0,0.19737337,0,0.31943921,0.257853709,0,0.089796296,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.448280083,0.147800651,0,0,0.331445468,0,0.106522619,0,0,0,0,0.089319705,0,0,0,0,0,0.073222623,0.178805215,0,0.203795811,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.066227566,0.099265187,0.178272351,0,0,0.303822989,0,0,0,0,0.109051626,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1,1,1,1,,,1,,13

This study draws on the theoretical base of trade show literature and the new service development (NSD) process for trade show innovation to propose an inductive and exploratory approach to researching this process in the exhibition industry. Based on qualitative elite interviews conducted from an organizer's perspective in two countries, Germany and Poland, it aims to profile the stages of NSD for new trade show innovations through analysis of the decision-making methodology and evaluation criteria used in this process. Structured interview data collected from 34 trade show organizers, offers empirical evidence for the strong relevance of trade show innovations in both developed and emerging exhibition markets. The study reveals that demand-related considerations are primary decision factors in the idea screening phase. Diverse partnership models are used for concept development, space-related revenue components are dominant in the business analysis phase, though value-added service revenues are close in terms of relevance. Two main clusters of organizers differ in terms of the methodology they use for evaluation, though both cite thorough analysis as vital in order to enable sustained innovation activity. The theoretical and managerial implications of the study findings suggest key methodology to apply and decision criteria to evaluate before authorizing a trade show innovation project.

Bureaucratic rigidities of the organisations do not allow them to deal with increasing complexity as they lack environments that encourage the knowledge flow, risk taking and flexibility on which adaptation thrives. The centralised power structure generates defensive mechanisms and discourages individuals to learn and to share knowledge. To remain flexible and adaptive the bureaucracies need to sustain their competitive advantage by capitalising on knowledge and experience of their experts. The leadership needs to think holistically about combining conditions of hierarchy and discipline with other forms of cooperation. Communities of practice can become the spaces of explicit and especially tacit knowledge exchange outside the usual organisational constraints and can foster environment of learning and collaboration internally and externally. However, there are many examples of failure to evolve them into a sustainable entity. This paper explores the process of cultivating communities of practice within a hierarchical organisation that manages large infrastructure programmes. It aims at studying how application of problem structuring techniques can assist the organisation under scrutiny in understanding the key sponsors' perceptions regarding communities of practice and how that can contribute to reducing a tension between a need to capitalise on expert knowledge and the individuals who are discouraged to learn by control structure of a hierarchical organisation.",2017,Conference Paper,,C13,1,2022,Journal,0.183232445,0,0,0,0.118619365,0,0,0,0.083887818,0,0,0,0.160743466,0,0,0,0,0,0.146521261,0,0.153181152,0,0.01902685,0.154043575,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.141785139,0.189680092,0,0,0,0,0.372230195,0.061597773,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.090609983,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.129060817,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.172776243,0,0.149384069,0,0,0.06480304,0,0,0,0.39421396,0.162603338,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.146925571,0.189317378,0,0,0,0.105472416,0.136880508,0.43835542,0.330910477,0,0,1,,,1,1,1,1,,,1,,13

Design/methodology/approach An exploratory multiple case study approach was adopted and three MNCs' sustainable initiatives in China were examined. The data were primarily collected through 43 semi-structured interviews with managers of focal companies and their multi-tier suppliers. Findings The authors found that in order to facilitate their supply chains to learn sustainability, MNCs tend to orchestrate in breadth by internally setting up new functional departments and externally working with third parties, and orchestrate in depth working directly with their extreme upstream suppliers adopting varied governance mechanisms on lower-tier suppliers along the project lifecycle. The resource orchestration in breadth and depth and along the project lifecycle results in changes of supply chain structure.

Companies could learn from the suggested learning stages and the best practices of case companies.

However, such opportunities are not a matter of the more, the better. An increasing number of emerging market categories poses a dilemma. While more emerging market categories arguably bring about increasing growth opportunities, they can also generate greater ambiguity for incumbent firms, which may hinder their innovation efforts. This study attempts to address this dilemma by proposing that the number of emerging market categories in an industry will have an inverted U-shaped relationship with incumbent firms' innovation efforts. We further argue that this curvilinear relationship will be influenced by the socio-cognitive context of a firm's focal industry, in the sense that the degree of collective identity incoherence at the industry level will intensify the proposed inverted U-shaped relationship, whereas the prevalence of trade associations in the industry will depress this relationship. We test our hypotheses by examining research and development (R&D) investments of a sample of U.S. high-technology manufacturing firms and find support for our main prediction and the hypothesized effect of collective identity incoherence.

Startup teams are integrated or internal projects teams are provided with office space, independence and resources. Corporate incubators have become a promising solution for companies that aim at achieving structural ambidexterity, i.e. organizational ambidexterity that is embedded in corporate structure. While the current business practice shows that many different configurations of corporate incubators exist, the underlying requirements remain unclear. This paper therefore addresses the research gap by deriving a model describing the requirements for the organizational structure of corporate incubators. The authors draw from organization theory in order to derive requirement dimensions. Then, current literature on ambidexterity research is used to infer requirement parameters for each requirement dimension. From a practitioner's perspective, the developed model allows a systematic planning process that helps achieving a consistent configuration of corporate incubators, which reduces failure rates.

They also examine if these effects are contingent on variations in the institutional environment and market environment. Design/methodology/approach Structural equation modeling and mediation analyses were used on a sample of 344 small- and medium-sized enterprises in Istanbul. Findings Business ties are positively related to exploratory innovation behavior and political ties hamper such behavior. The authors also show that government support hinders firms' disruptive innovation while encouraging incremental innovation behavior. The authors further demonstrate that the positive and indirect relation of business ties to new product performance through exploratory and exploitative innovation is largely insensitive to changes in market and institutional environments. Political ties are negatively (positively) and indirectly related to new product performance through exploratory (exploitative) innovation.

However, the current need to educate a planetary citizenry under conditions relevant to the living context of our planet is palpable. A new education paradigm is emerging to address this need, and it takes its cue from the life sciences-biomimicry, ecosystem studies, permaculture and the like, and from the sciences of complexity-complex adaptive systems theory, second order cybernetics, social systems dynamics and the emerging field of systemic innovation. This article explores both the pressures for such a new paradigm of education, tracing their sources to contemporary dynamics in society and environment, and outlines of the new paradigm in education that is emerging in various parts of the world. Key to this new paradigm is the emphasis on lifelong learning and empathy oriented education, both critical ingredients to the transformative role of education for individual and collective thrivability.

An extensive systematic review of the existing literature is carried out to investigate the progress of prior research, and to use the insights to define future research pathways. This review is primarily based on the most frequently used innovation approaches, especially frugal innovation, jugaad, disruptive innovation, Gandhian innovation, catalytic innovation, indigenous innovation, bricolage, blowback innovation, trickle-up innovation, resource-constrained innovation, and BOP innovation. Our analysis finds growing standardization in terminology usage and increasing emphasis on bottom-up and structured innovation approaches.

Prior research have drawn its research attention to technological innovation and focussed on the biopharmaceutical and technological sectors as the main research contexts. Thus, to gain a wider picture of the structural characteristics of innovation ecosystem, this paper aims to complement the existing technological-centred literature and provides understanding of aesthetic innovation by focussing on exploring the role of actors and intermediaries in either facilitating or inhibiting innovation in the creative sector. Design/methodology/approach This is an exploratory study and the qualitative method was employed. With aim to explore aesthetic innovation in the creative sector, this research grounded its context in the UK designer fashion sector, which is part of the creative industries. Data were collected through a series of semi-structured interviews with respondents being purposely selected so as to ensure representativeness. A wider range of participants within the designer fashion sector was covered. Such multiple-sourced data collection approach allowed this research to triangulate data so that research trustworthiness was enhanced. Findings The result suggests the role of a broker in beyond traditionally facilitating knowledge exchange. This paper provides empirical evidence regarding the critical role of a broker in shaping the open innovation mechanism when it comes to aesthetic innovation. A broker in fact occupies a strategic position that allows it to negotiate relationships among the connected organisations and thus to govern the interaction mechanism of the innovation ecosystem as a whole. Given the empowered broker in such setting, the relationship between innovation creators and innovation seekers is controlled by a broker, which leads to risk that an innovation creator may not fully appropriate the value that it creates. Research limitations/implications The main limitation of this study is its specific context, that is, the UK designer fashion industry. Such focus limits the scope of generalisation particularly its application to the entire creative sector. Thus, it is suggested that future research may consider to explore other creative industries so that the understanding of the open innovation mechanism from a structural perspective applied to aesthetic innovation can be enhanced. Originality/value This paper outlines the structural mechanism of open innovation applied to aesthetic innovation. The result contributes to the literature by complementing the findings derived from technology-centred research. Also, empirical evidence of this study is particularly of value to policy makers in the aspect of creative sector development.

In a dynamic context, the current approach to BPM appears to be limited and static in the face of the challenges posed by the firm's open innovation (OI) ecosystem. The main purpose of this paper is to shed light on the value co-creation through the integration of OI principles and mechanisms of value system. Design/methodology/approach To this aim, the paper suggested a conceptual integration of strategy and operations literature on OI and the firm's value creation system. This analysis adopted BPM lenses with specific attention to the alignment between value creation and value capture. Applying BPM lenses to the process of creating shared value sought the attainment of a comprehensive system of decisions articulated between strategy and operations. Findings The paper pinpoints key links between strategy models and operational planning, thus proposing a new framework that integrates the characteristics of value system and OI. The paper elaborates a new theoretical framework rooted in the extant literature conducted in BPM, business strategy and business model innovation (BMI) fields. Originality/value This paper aims to fill the gap in the literature in which strategy models are separately treated from the operational ones.

Design/methodology/approach - This study used structural equation modelling to test the data from 3,125 engineering professionals in the Australian Public Service (APS). Findings - The structural model indicated that leadership for innovation and ambidextrous culture for innovation influenced workplace innovation which, in turn, improved career satisfaction. Moreover, modelling revealed a significant relationship between ambidextrous culture for innovation and career satisfaction. This study also investigated mediation effects and revealed both simple and sequential mediation paths in the model. It was found that improving workplace innovation and career satisfaction through recognition of an engineer's contribution to their agency would assist in retaining and advancing in-house engineering expertise. Practical implications - The structural model could be used to address current shortages of engineering professionals in the Commonwealth of Australia departments. The findings emphasise the importance of Commonwealth departments providing opportunities for their engineers to engage in creative and innovative projects which enhance their professional career.

Entrepreneurs have developed new strategies to enter new markets and fend off competition using novel business model breakthroughs. Entrepreneurs in the new economy identify niches and develop new customers, new products and/or new architectural approaches (linking existing technologies in novel ways) to a market. Knowledge and information-represented by intellectual capital-have become increasingly important drivers of production and commerce. As important as intellectual capital has become, the business model which gains economic rewards from this intellectual capital has become even more important. Within this context, strategies have evolved that begin with the intellectual capital (driving innovation) and development of business models that support electronic business models. Do new technology and technology streams drive the development of novel business models or does the novel business model drive strategic focus and intellectual capital development (innovation) to serve the new business models? How does a business model for these emergent businesses develop and what elements of business model and strategy develop and with what is the sequential timing in this new environment? In this paper, I will draw upon several well-known companies(Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Tesla) and compare their progression through the strategic frontier of new and novel to develop a model of what comes first; strategy, business model or intellectual capital (driving innovation). This model will be valuable as managers develop business plans to bring new ideas to market or novel new business models to apply..

It is proposed that ethical leadership not only positively affects employee green innovation behavior, but also transmits through the mediation role of green organizational identity.At the same time, strategic flexibility plays a moderating role between ethical leadership and green organizational identification.

A comprehensive model of organizational level IT innovation adoption is presented based on a context-mechanism-outcome perspective and by drawing on relevant theories. The proposed model is empirically tested using data from 1988 company executives across a wide range of organizations globally. A research model and the related hypotheses are tested using structural equation modelling. The study found that organizational level IT innovation readiness conceptualized through technology readiness and internal expertise is a key mediator for successful organizational level technology adoption. Other organizational factors such as top management support, organizational structure, and organization culture, were positively related to the overall level of IT innovation readiness and organizational level technology adoption. Considering that there are many organizational factors that influence the adoption of technology, future research should extend the research framework and include additional variables that could support IT innovation adoption outcomes. The study makes a significant contribution to the existing literature by providing empirical evidence related to the organizational factors necessary for a successful IT innovation adoption at an organizational level.(c) 2022 The Authors.

To this end, firms engage in various open innovation relationships, aiming to create and capture value in multi-actor contexts. This can give rise to a paradox of openness due to the contradictory role of knowledge as a key resource that creates value when shared, but also as a source of appropriability challenges. We explore the concept of a paradox within a paradox; the knowledge-leveraging paradox embedded within the paradox of openness. We integrate a knowledge-based view with paradox theory and develop a conceptual model to pinpoint core knowledge-related transferability and exposure tensions. We then show how these tensions are inversely moderated by innovation-related knowledge ambiguity. This ambiguity amplifies transferability tensions by making the knowledge more difficult to transfer and integrate across organizational boundaries, while relieving exposure tensions for the same reasons. We discuss potential solutions for resolving these core knowledge-related tensions by identifying separation and restructuring mechanisms that can facilitate simultaneous knowledge transfer and alleviate exposure hazards.",2021,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indmarman.2021.01.011,C15,9,2019,,0.299055389,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.15528377,0.098594025,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.120562945,0,0,0.16993093,0,0,0,0,0,0.231408853,0,0.121231675,0,0.218069625,0,0.45564029,0.226202179,0,0,0,0.136914093,0,0.114764358,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.122584707,0,0.235876241,0,0,0.084075188,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.211492293,0,0.121905569,0,0,0,0,0.282251455,0,0.080425037,0.132693215,0,0.327981512,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.078347109,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.184216426,0.086071259,0.111701979,0,0.135020522,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,,1,21

To address this issue, it draws on the disruptive innovation theory and evolution perspective to investigate the evolution mechanism of latecomer firms' value network in a disruptive innovation context. By using an exploratory case of Haier, a four-stage model is proposed to present the evolution process of value network matching with that of latecomer firms catching-up.

Supported by three different case studies, the research focuses on the different factors that affect crowdsourcing for open innovation. Moreover, the findings give us a proposed managerial framework to be considered when adopting crowdsourcing in addition to factors that proved its huge effect on crowdsourcing activities. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative research approach for this research was the most convenient. It focuses on providing an in-depth understanding of the phenomena. Qualitative research represents the views and perspectives of the participants in a study besides it is driven by a desire to explain these events, through existing or emerging concepts (Yin, 2016). Adopting a case study research method that investigates a contemporary phenomenon (the case) in depth and within its real-world context, especially when the boundaries between phenomenon and context may not be evident (Yin, 2018) as in crowdsourcing based business model for open innovation. Findings The researchers presented the benefits and challenges when considering crowdsourcing establishing a managerial framework for open innovation. Additionally, the researchers identified the different factors that highly affect crowdsourcing proposing a model that can be used for adopting crowdsourcing. The research also presented insights about how crowdsourcing was introduced in the Egyptian market and how it evolved through the years. Research limitations/implications The study had some limitations to be considered in the following work. Company X used crowdsourcing within a high degree of limitations and confidentially consequently, restricting the effects and results of crowdsourcing. Another limitation was that the study has been only qualitative, and the addition of the quantitative approach will numerically support the findings. Moreover, the research depended on the businesses only as of the source of information and neglected the crowd sample. Practical implications The main aim of this study was to address the lack of research evidence on what it means to adopt crowdsourcing for open innovation in Egyptian firms. The authors have done so by adopting three case studies which enabled them to directly observe and report on the daily work of trust CEOs, with special attention to the practices. Whereby, these executives made themselves knowledgeable for all practical purposes, as dictated by their specific job. Accordingly, the first major contribution of the present research is that it provides much-needed empirical data on the actual practices of crowdsourcing in three Egyptian, yet international companies. Moreover, the results could be used as a guideline when considering crowdsourcing activities highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of such activities. Originality/value The paper discusses different perspectives of crowdsourcing presenting a new categorization for its types. Moreover, how these types have been used especially in the Egyptian market. On the other hand, the paper investigated and documented three different sized companies' experiences utilizing crowdsourcing for innovation. The collected information was used to suggest a new model by which companies can avoid the difficulties others had. Moreover, the research highlighted the benefits and challenges of using crowdsourcing for open innovation.",2022,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/AJB-08-2020-0126,C1,6,2022,Journal,0,0,0.406777111,0,0,0,0.126387061,0.139066489,0,0,0,0,0,0.278132977,0,0,0.130256901,0.065351028,0,0,0,0,0.055621485,0.225158979,0.101455968,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.195295214,0,0,0.180069718,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06622039,0,0.087146169,0,0,0.092832661,0,0,0.282964107,0.075294677,0.351419438,0,0,0.083354751,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.129392089,0,0,0.072025734,0,0.232943638,0,0,0.075688404,0.061636711,0.351419438,0.058723773,0.13490795,0.140437305,0.070164818,0.252020822,0.100848933,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,,1,21

Insights are drawn from four cases of organisations that engaged in corporate entrepreneurial activities. The paper identifies two dimensions of corporate entrepreneurship programmes as idea themes, indicating whether programmes are designed with specific themes in mind, and idea ownership, indicating whether there is a dedicated team to focus on new ideas, or not. These dimensions are under the direct control of management. Based on these two dimensions, four models of corporate entrepreneurial activities are presented linking each of these models to one of the four cases of product innovations (product line extensions, product improvements, new products, start-up businesses). By drawing on the insights of the effectuation and causation logics, the paper provides a fresh perspective of corporate entrepreneurship programmes in an emerging, non-Western cultural setup and the product innovation context.

The results indicate that organizational ambidexterity positively mediates the relationship between pro-innovation culture and NPD performance. The results show that when both exploration and exploitation are increased simultaneously, after an initial decline, NPD performance shows a rising trend. NPD performance tends to decline generally when there is an imbalance between the two though the plateau is at a point where exploitation is slightly higher than exploration. Additionally, pro-innovation culture can increase the gap between exploration and exploitation for exploration-oriented firms, which can lower their NPD performance. Overall, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms that explain why firms with pro-innovation culture have higher NPD performance. Further, it enhances our understanding of the role of pro-innovation culture as an organizational context for building organizational ambidexterity, and provides new insights that can help reconcile the combined and balanced views of ambidexterity in enhancing NPD performance.

In this regard, this paper aims to explore the role of green process innovation and environmental orientation toward environmental performance for achieving the long-term goal of carbon neutrality. In addition, this paper also discovers a mediating role of green competitive advantage in said context. Using data from a survey among managers of equipment manufacturing sector, the study employed structural equation modeling technique and found that green process innovation, environmental orientation and green competitive advantage significantly influence environmental performance. Subsequently, mediation analysis indicated that green competitive advantage partially mediates the relation from green process innovation and environmental orientation to environmental performance.

This challenge is particularly pertinent when industries emerge, typically a time of high levels of technological uncertainty. It has been long understood that technological uncertainty functions as important stimulus for firms to manage their boundaries. However, two to some extent competing strategy perspectives-governance and competence-predict that firms faced with uncertainty would either increase or decrease their scope of activities, respectively. To reconcile these conflicting positions, we propose a model in which knowledge modularity moderates the effect of technological uncertainty on firms' research and development (R&D) scope decisions. We develop new measures for R&D scope, knowledge modularity, and technological uncertainty, drawing on population ecology, network theory, and technology management. We test our model empirically using data on patenting activity and firm boundary location in the emerging automotive air bag industry. Our results generally support our model and show that in case of knowledge-generating activities such as R&D, scope decisions under technological uncertainty are more driven by concerns about the risk of obsolescence than the risk of opportunistic behavior.

These relationships are explored in the context of Africa, where, paradoxically, firms selling abroad must satisfy different market demands than firms that serve only domestic markets. Design/methodology/approach The authors draw on the World Bank Enterprise Survey to perform a cross-sectional analysis of 4,683 manufacturing firms. These surveys cover the period 2009-2017 and 35 different African countries. The authors define service competence development as co-location with knowledge-intensive business service (KIBS) firms, measured through KIBS density at city level. Signaling is measured through outward-looking competences. Findings This paper shows that African exporters differ significantly from their non-exporting counterparts in terms of productivity and competences. External service competence generates productivity gains for exporters but has the opposite effect for non-exporters. Results consistent with previous research also show that signaling competences generate productivity gains, but the effect for firms serving domestic markets is stronger than the effect for exporting firms. The authors use paradoxes of learning to interpret these results. Originality/value The study develops a novel empirical approach to analyzing firm competences in Africa. It also shows that contextualization of existing knowledge management theories matters, opening a research avenue to test further existing theories in emerging economies.",2020,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JKM-07-2018-0433,C3,3,2021,Article,0,0,0,0.116574701,0,0,0.142574724,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.146940213,0.073721192,0,0,0.126287667,0,0.031372744,0,0,0.130642373,0.262030327,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.110154319,0,0,0.076174897,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.149403804,0.270446792,0,0,0,0,0.357447121,0.117852475,0.106402056,0,0,0,0.084938424,0,0,0,0,0.071221258,0,0.369471674,0,0,0.053425794,0.058385855,0,0,0.081250795,0,0.262779074,0.110449679,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.105616349,0.39575766,0,0.113765671,0,0,0.117059686,0,0,0,0.173909978,0,0,0,0,0.320055268,1,,,,,,,,,,1,21

Even though encountering many challenges ahead, China is positioning itself to take over the global innovation leadership in the next few decades. Here in this article, we introduce a serious yet underexplored question: could China go beyond catch-up and become the global innovation powerhouse? Specifically, drawing from the holistic innovation perspective, which is an original theoretical paradigm for the mission-oriented innovation policy change, this article critically reviews, both qualitatively and quantitatively, China's remarkable innovation progress and main drivers in comparison with G7 countries plus South Korea and India, trying to provide a comprehensive and critical view of state-of-the-art research on China's innovation catch-up. We further explore the five major challenges that China must take seriously when marching toward the global innovation powerhouse. Finally, we propose a mission-oriented holistic STI policy design framework for both China and other emerging economies to go beyond catch-up in a competitive dynamic world.

In this paper, we empirically examine the extent to which firm-level strategic agility predicts the adoption of three (value creation, value capture, and value proposition) types of BMIs. Furthermore, we propose that the relationship between firm-level strategic agility and BMI adoption is contingent on the degree of environmental turbulence. Finally, we explore the mediating role that BMI plays in the relationship between firm-level strategic agility and firm performance. Our analysis of data from 432 German firms in the electronics industry indicates that strategic agility is positively related to BMI and that this relationship is indeed strengthened by the degree of environmental turbulence. Additionally, our findings show that, while value proposition and value creation BMIs have positive relationships with firm performance, value capture innovation is negatively related to firm performance; these findings are contrary to our prediction. Finally, the results of our mediation tests indicate that BMI serves as an important intermediary mechanism through which firms' strategic agility contributes to superior firm performance.",2021,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TEM.2019.2910381,C8,4,2021,Article,0,0,0,0,0.135884483,0,0.099053815,0.108991111,0,0,0,0.099350438,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.083923758,0.410847082,0,0,0.01089811,0.264697061,0.039757237,0,0.091022808,0,0.102711771,0,0.162422048,0,0,0.108298984,0.076529732,0,0,0.070563364,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.088480843,0,0,0.049745001,0.051899159,0,0.0682994,0,0,0.072756096,0,0,0,0,0.642645033,0.091544109,0,0.065327937,0,0,0,0,0.107614591,0,0,0.09644693,0,0.040563583,0,0,0.225796015,0,0,0.076734934,0,0.059319563,0.09661355,0,0.046023807,0.105731923,0,0.054990541,0,0,0.19346233,0,0,0,0,0.064649232,0.060411994,0,0,0,0.16330977,0.074119485,1,,,,,,,,,,1,21

It consists of 22 questions to address the five constructs of the proposed hypothesized conceptual model, developed for the study. Data of 311 students from HEIs of Maharashtra state in India were collected. Confirmatory factor analysis is carried out to test the model fitness, reliability and validity, and structural equation modeling is applied to conduct path analysis and hypotheses testing of the model. Findings Hypotheses testing reveals that perceived usefulness (PU) significantly affects the perceived learning effectiveness, which again affects the learning satisfaction of the students. In addition, perceived ease of use affects the PU as suggested in the technology acceptance model. The prerecorded videos have a moderating role to play in the computer self-efficacy and the perceived learning effectiveness of the students. This research will provide meaningful acumen to enhance the overall learning process among students in urban as well as rural India. Originality/value This study explores the technology-mediated learning during the unexpected and dynamic situations of the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of higher education in India. For sustainable use of technology-assisted learning, educators must understand the key factors that influence students' learning effectiveness and satisfaction. The research outcomes will lead toward developing the human capacities, as the prerecorded videos at the HEIs of India will provide new approaches for effectively adopting digital technologies and technology-mediated learning.",2022,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/OTH-04-2021-0057,C8,4,2019,Journal,0,0,0.093281423,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.121488991,0.069006125,0.358443445,0.224792771,0,0,0,0.074279707,0.019132534,0,0.069797121,0,0,0,0,0.130816662,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.139364807,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.062693964,0,0,0,0,0.059952626,0,0,0.063864676,0.072662533,0,0.064888839,0.051799335,0.644695178,0,0,0.114688603,0,0,0,0.04343398,0,0.075106907,0,0,0.032581492,0.08901591,0,0,0.0991009,0,0,0,0,0.052070202,0.042403272,0,0,0.046405286,0,0,0,0.138759017,0.169819569,0.369354153,0.071388349,0,0,0,0.265145642,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,1,,1,,,1,1,12

We demonstrate how firms adjust their organizational structures to increase exploration, a process of constantly addressing countervailing organizational and interorganizational demands by deploying, combining, and changing balancing mechanisms at the organizational and managerial levels.

Drawing on knowledge-based view, this paper first proposes a model to integrate IT design with relationships governance, then investigates and compares the technological and relational antecedents of collaborative innovation for focal firms in IT-enabled IORs, and finally explores the competitive performance impact of collaborative innovation. The research model is evaluated with data collected from 191 Chinese firms that digitally collaborate with their distributors. The findings suggest that digital platforms capability and two governance mechanisms (i.e., contractual governance and relational governance) work together to influence collaborative innovation, which in turn enables focal firms to obtain competitive performance. This study provides theoretical and practical implications for collaborative innovation literature by discovering the different impacts of IT design and governance mechanisms on collaborative innovation in the context of IT-enabled IORs.

Specifically, in this systematic analysis, we apply exploratory, bibliometric, and network visualization techniques to characterize the available knowledge in the field. We trace the growth trajectory of this emerging literature and map the knowledge base of the open eco-innovation (OE) research field. We conceptualised four phases of research domain development and recognised that OE is at the acceleration phase. We emphasized that a synthetic knowledge base is one of the basic ingredients of an open eco-innovation model in addition to analytic and symbolic knowledge bases. Finally, we highlighted what might seem to be budding theoretical perspectives underlining open eco-innovation.

While European regions are different in many ways, the innovation capacity of regions, clusters and firms is what makes them capable of building up new and diversified pathways for sustainable growth. For this reason, Innovation Drivers and Regional Innovation Strategies looks to analyze different knowledge drivers (e.g. entrepreneurial or policy-orientation; scientific and practice-based knowledge modes; institutional innovation support) that influence the innovative and competitive capacity of regions, clusters and firms in Europe. The aim of this volume is to develop an in-depth understanding of these drivers and their implications for the way in which regional and cluster growth may be upgraded. Innovation Drivers and Regional Innovation Strategies examines the construction of new innovation pathways for regions and clusters in different geographical contexts. The main themes are cluster evolution, regional innovation systems and business innovation modes and capabilities. The objectives are centred on exploring the logic and mechanisms that can be activated as a means to promote innovation and competitiveness within regions and, within these, across and within firms. Aimed at researchers and academics in the field, this is a thoughtful and innovative new volume that helps define the academic debate. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2016 Taylor & Francis.

With travel retailers as the data analysis unit, 261 cases were collected in two waves from the travel supply chain in Taiwan. This study adopts two-step approach of confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling method to investigate the relationship among different constructs. Based on the path analysis results of the theoretical model, five of six paths were confirmed and operational effectiveness, knowledge governance capability, and modularity production were all positively affected by MK; two of them mediated the positive relationship between MK and product innovations, except for knowledge governance capability. This study echoes recent call for the possible factors as the key mediators on MK and innovation relationship in SME-FBs context.

It considers the roots of competitive advantage to highlight different patterns and foundations of achieving superior performance. It investigates whether pursuing a risky strategy fosters revenue dynamics growth and whether different mediators are included in that relationship. Design/methodology/approach Path analysis (structural equation modeling) method is used to analyze data from 122 companies of various sizes and industries. All respondents were responsible for executing strategic management processes. The paper used the subjective perspective, which is based on the individual opinion of senior company managers and owners. Findings The authors find a positive relationship between risky strategy and firm performance, but no evidence of a mediating role of competitive advantage and dynamic growth in this relationship. Competitive advantage should be perceived as a set of integrated factors that can be analyzed from an aggregated perspective. Integrating all antecedents requires a holistic and systematic approach and the development of a particular mindset. Aggregated competitive advantage is related to setting dynamic growth as a priority. However, no relationship between risky strategy and achieving competitive advantage, or between implementing a risky strategy and setting dynamic growth as a priority, is observed, which was assumed to explain the revenue dynamics growth. Research limitations/implications Secondary data should be analyzed to explore how risky strategies are manifested, and which managerial decisions are reflected in high-level risk. A multidimensional scale could be developed to check how risk shapes the constructs' interdependence. Therefore, the dynamic capabilities approach could be further expanded. Practical implications This research offers insights into the short-term relationship between risky strategy and revenue dynamics, although competitive advantage does not mediate that relationship. Special attention should be paid to the selected antecedents of competitive advantage, as they influence dynamic growth. Originality/value This work provides insights into different antecedents of competitive advantage, which is not necessarily based on making risky decisions, and into factors that facilitate firm performance measured by revenue dynamics.",2021,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EBR-12-2019-0306,C2,4,2019,Article,0.15264814,0,0,0.11779798,0,0,0,0,0.209656964,0,0,0,0,0,0.100651552,0,0,0,0,0,0.127612869,0,0.031701955,0,0,0.264026542,0.132389973,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.02565808,0,0,0,0.069885655,0.159031974,0,0.128692761,0,0,0.217057886,0.075485788,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.107518588,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.071968619,0,0,0,0,0.053986419,0.058998528,0.144070835,0.155049634,0,0.135462348,0,0.111608684,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.053362318,0,0,0,0,0.734408643,0.039429351,0,0,0,0.175734905,0,0,0.137838223,0,0.107804591,1,,,,1,,1,,,1,1,12

A systematic literature review was conducted, focusing on the mapping of the specificities of publications on frugal innovation. Our results show an emerging theme that has grown substantially over the last three years. Frugal innovation has generated significant changes for people, especially in the aspect of products and services offered to society. The societal benefit of frugal innovations in socially vulnerable communities still has potential for exploration in forthcoming studies, particularly with regard to tangible indicators of impact measurement. Despite the gradual evolution of publications on the theme over the years, the focus of the studies is still centered on conceptual investigations and descriptive case studies. Some propositional and evaluative approaches appear in the studies, but there is still a need to use management theories to instill an awareness of management precepts that recognize the social dynamics of the operationalization of frugal innovation. Future studies can generate breakthroughs with analytical categories that explore the perspectives of a resource-based view: institutional theory, contingency theory, learning theory, and actor network theory.

In this review, a science-mapping technique was applied to assess 362 Scopus-indexed articles and conference papers concerned with the BMI process. Due to technological progress, competitive changes, or governmental and regulatory alterations, the need to develop and adapt a firm's business model has become an important task to sustain any organizations. The successful adaptation of an existing business model to a new environment closes the gap between the firm's basis of competitive advantage in the industry and its extant resources and capabilities. However, innovating the business model remains one of today's most challenging tasks. The aim of this review is to reveal the size, growth trajectory and geographic distribution of the BMI process knowledge base. Moreover, the goal is to detect key journals, authors and publications, as well as to give an overview of the intellectual structure of the literature and possibly highlight actual trends in the domain of BMI process. The review attested a modest-sized knowledge base concentrated in Western countries. Furthermore, three 'Schools of Thoughts' were identified and further explained. It is a first attempt of a bibliometric review for this field, and thus shall give guidance for future research and practical implications.

Resources and experiences may give platform owners an advantage to expand their business to new areas of possible growth. However, can the winner take it all? Or is the spandex rule - ""just because you can, does not mean you should""- valid for platforms, as well? The present study is aimed at narrowing this research gap by focusing on the innovation through brand extension impact on customer satisfaction and brand loyalty in an ever-greater area of the service sector. Design/Methodology/Approach. The partial least-squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) is applied to analyse the questionnaires and explore the relationships between the proposed research model's constructs. Findings. The results reveal that service innovation through brand extension impacts customer satisfaction and loyalty favourably. Customer satisfaction mediates the relation between innovation through brand extension and brand loyalty. Parent brand reputation intensifies service innovation through the impact of brand extension on customer satisfaction and loyalty, while perceived risk deters its effects. Customer innovativeness enhances customer satisfaction. Finally, perceived category similarity (fit) augments customer satisfaction while impacting loyalty negatively. Practical Implications. The findings provide a deeper understanding of innovation and brand management in digital platforms and forge a promising path forward for marketing researchers investigating the platform economy. Originality/Value. Little remains acknowledged regarding the theoretical interface of innovation through brand extension in the digital platform sphere and its consequences on customer behaviour. Building on this lacuna, the authors adopt an underexplored object that focuses on digital platform innovation through brand extension, customer satisfaction, and brand loyalty.

By investigating ChinaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s manufacturers such as shipbuilding, energy, food, and daily necessities manufacturing sectors, we witness that the relationship between environmental regulation and business sustainability could be positively subsequently mediated by green organizational identity and sustainable innovation. While this identity does not exercise a positive mediation between environmental regulation and business sustainability significantly. Furthermore, both sustainable exploration/exploitation innovations exercise a significantly positive mediation between green organizational identity and business sustainability. We therefore conclude that manufacturers of emerging markets need a thoughtful deployment in pro-environmental psychologies and behaviors to closely bridge environmental regulation and business sustainability instead of only concerning on one aspect. This study has significant implications for emerging markets constructing a comprehensive as well as systematic pro-environmental path by using the merit of Institutional Theory to enhance business sustainability with more standardized and professional ways.

Approach: There is a structural disconnect between civil society and the world of innovation. However, the exploration of the divergences between the neo-institutional and neo-evolutionist perspectives of the triple helix makes it possible to state that the evolution of funders in different contexts can generate an emerging articulation. The effects on the existing ""systemness"", particularly in Latin America and the Caribbean, will depend to a large extent on the conceptual approach adopted and on its institutionalization in terms of restructuring the systemness of innovation systems and their governance. Findings: The evolution of the relationships between emerging financing mechanisms and innovative projects in Latin America and the Caribbean constitutes both an opportunity and a risk. If ""systemness"" is restructured, the region could follow a path with high expectations; if traditional sub-dynamics persist, the emerging phenomenon could be stripped of its full potential. Contribution: A different conceptual and practical analysis of the topic of financing innovation is proposed, with emphasis on the Latin American and Caribbean case. Additionally, research paths are suggested that reduce uncertainty about the relationship between the actors of the innovation system and civil society and its potential impact.

Although considerable attention has been devoted to its emergent properties and selection outcomes, less focus has been given to understand how disruption emerges through evolving and complex interactions that occur during that process. To address this shortfall, this article draws on chaos theory to examine the nature of disruptive innovation as a nonlinear dynamic system. Disruptive innovation can be considered nonlinear because it is time-dependent and deviation-absorbing, and it revolves around identifiable types of attractors appearing in a deterministic context or trajectory. To illustrate and advance these ideas, we study inkjet printer and digital photography technologies using patent application data collected from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We employ a nonlinear analysis of the correlation dimension to measure the unpredictability of disruptive change and found that both chosen technologies evolved through a nonlinear dynamic process. Furthermore, in light of chaos theory and by way of comparison, we indicated two types of disruption: high-dimensional and low-dimensional chaos. Implications for innovation theory and business practice are explored herein.

Drawing on behavioral theory and organizational learning, we argue that the length of time that a firm has been underperforming contributes to shaping firms' innovative search patterns. We test our theory merging COMPUSTAT and NBER patent data for 1,610 high-tech manufacturing companies between 1986 and 2006. Our results largely support our predicted curvilinear relationships. We find that innovative search magnitude and scope each first decreases and then increases with underperformance duration. In addition, we find marginal evidence that innovative search depth first increases and then decreases with underperformance duration. The statistical and practical significance of the results is also discussed.Managerial Summary: Innovation is vital for a firm's survival and competitive advantage and requires a search for knowledge. Previous research suggests that the gap between current performance and desired performance is an important trigger for firms' innovative action. We suggest that how long the firm has been underperforming also plays an important role in firm innovation. Using financial and patent data on public high technology manufacturing firms, we show that there are nonlinear relationships between the duration of a firm's underperformance and its innovative activities. We find that underperforming firms first decrease and then increase R&D spending and the use of new knowledge as underperformance prolongs. Our results imply that underperforming firms face competing short- and long-term pressures that influence the nature of its innovative activities.",2019,,,C7,3,2021,Journal,0.084129418,0.237496661,0,0.064922347,0,0.083352086,0,0.43683992,0,0,0.075746508,0,0,0,0.055472386,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.026207987,0,0.03186966,0.072756862,0,0,0,0.119462879,0,0,0.068209105,0,0.184040195,0.21158773,0,0.028282026,0,0,0,0.423679149,0,0,0.07092682,0,0,0.199379585,0.166410816,0,0.109498487,0.069162542,0.206911104,0.05832176,0,0.26253584,0.059257035,0.141910769,0,0.073382354,0.04730359,0.0523673,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.081337426,0.077312487,0.029753694,0.048774048,0,0,0,0,0.07317297,0.123022445,0.132349042,0.142652842,0.038723025,0,0.036892983,0.042377699,0.088229194,0,0.079165554,0.126715905,0,0,0.021730814,0,0.139706717,0.10364649,0.048426647,0.062847371,0.067088895,0.227901554,0,0,1,,,1,,,1,,,1,,11

This study models organizational learning with forgetting and derives some novel implications. Most noteworthy, our findings point out limits to the contention that promoting rapid learning undermines long-run knowledge. Slower learning is not always better. When agents are subject to forgetting, raising the rate of interpersonal learning often enhances the diversity of beliefs within an organization, as well as the number and range of aspects of the environment that organizational members come to know. The rate of learning that maximizes organizational knowledge or diversity varies with the rate of forgetting. Organizations need not sacrifice diversity as they gain knowledge.

Yet, previous empirical research has modeled this balance as the interaction of orthogonal activities. In this study, we show that there is a trade-off between exploration and exploitation and that the optimal balance between exploration and exploitation depends upon environmental conditions. Using a novel methodology to measure the relative exploration versus exploitation orientation, we find an inverted U-shaped relationship between the relative share of explorative orientation and financial performance. This relationship is positively, moderated by the R&D intensity of the industry in which the firm operates.

This study further examines how environmental aspects (i.e., dynamism and competitiveness) moderate the effectiveness of exploratory and exploitative innovation. Results indicate that centralization negatively affects exploratory innovation, whereas formalization positively influences exploitative innovation. Interestingly, connectedness within units appears to be an important antecedent of both exploratory and exploitative innovation. Furthermore, our findings reveal that pursuing exploratory innovation is more effective in dynamic environments, whereas pursuing exploitative innovation is more beneficial to a unit's financial performance in more competitive environments.

Design/methodology/approach The study conducts an exploratory research and adopts the grounded theory methodology in the context of BSP. Data draw mainly upon nine semi-structured interviews. Findings The knowledge spillovers in BSP are driven by institutions, which work through mechanisms of legitimacy perception. Formal and informal institutions influence organizational and individual behavior through legitimacy pressure and support. Formal institutions impose legitimacy pressure on organizations and individuals, forcing them to cooperate closely to solve problems; informal institutions enable them to adopt innovative strategies and positive attitudes through legitimacy support; all these promote knowledge spillovers in research and development (R&D) activities, engineering practice and regional interaction. Knowledge spillovers enable stakeholders to realize their R&D advancement, manufacturing promotion and management sophistication. Further, regional knowledge diffusion and culture transmission promote regional innovation and social capital accumulation. Research limitations/implications The study develops a theoretical model that shows how knowledge spillover mechanisms happen in BSP from an institutional perspective (the trigger, the channels/process and the impacts). More specifically, this explanation is provided by explaining how formal and informal institutions influence organizational and individual behavior through legitimacy perceptions. Practical implications First, policymakers should recognize and value the guiding, supporting and coordinating role of formal institutions and enrich capital forms to release the legitimacy pressure of stakeholders. Second, management of BSP needs to be capable of coordinating stakeholder relationships and interactions, while management should focus their attention on fostering good organizational routines and shared group value. Third, the local culture and customs should be taken into consideration since it can be an enabling or constraining of BSP. Finally, industries can take advantage of the opportunity to coordinate their R&D efforts to gain competitiveness. Originality/value First, the authors introduce the institutional perspective to analyze the construction process of BSP, which helps to better understand the interactions of stakeholders under the influence of institutions, the dynamic process and impacts of knowledge spillovers. Second, the authors are committed to contributing to the development of knowledge spillover theories by adopting an institutional perspective. The authors furthermore explore and propose the presence of a dynamic mechanism between institutional dualism and knowledge spillovers. In consequence, the authors introduce the concept of legitimacy perceptions, which is a bridge to understanding the interaction between them.

Design/methodology/approach The concept of maturity models is adopted to support companies in developing distinctive capabilities for servitization. A systematic literature review and case study approach are employed to develop the maturity model. Findings The findings highlight 46 capabilities classified into seven categories: strategy and leadership, performance, offerings, customers, organization, network and digital technology. Furthermore, the evolutionary path is defined by combining two types of levels, i.e. capability and maturity levels, to develop these capabilities. Research limitations/implications The evolutionary path was partially validated through the application, while further investigation is required to validate the evolutionary path. Therefore, future research should investigate the further validation of the evolutionary path by conducting multiple case studies. Practical implications The proposed maturity model enables companies to not only capture the bigger picture of the required capabilities without oversight, but also determine a process for improving the requisite capabilities with feasible efforts.

We ask what the main leadership strategies are that key actors pursue to gain leverage in their efforts to boost green growth. We use the well-known categories of transactional and transformational leadership. The following are the main research questions: (a) What do place leaders do to boost green institutional paths? (b) How do they aim to amplify their limited power base? and (c) How do they amplify their ability to influence both place-based and placeless agents? We scrutinize these questions in the context of green path development in two Finnish regions. The empirical study follows a two parallel single case study design. The cases in this paper deal with the cleantech-related path development in the Tampere city-region and bioeconomy-related path development in Central Finland. The two case studies were carefully chosen to illustrate the two main green growth-related industries in two different Finnish regions.

The innovative vector of Swiss economy with a focus on its own financial resources, a developed national scientific and educational environment, as well as mechanisms of tax incentives for scientific and innovative activities of large, small and medium-sized enterprises at the regional level allowed Switzerland to become one of the leaders in the world innovation market. Russia can borrow the experience of Switzerland in the development of multichannel and targeted financial support for innovative activities of SMEs carrying out R&D in areas of scientific and technological development and focus on the production of science-intensive products. A certain exemption from the income tax and a reduction in the rate of insurance tax to SME employees engaged in innovative activities in priority sectors of Russia, the introduction of tax incentives and tax deductions such as patent boxes and super deductions will ensure the increase of the number of SMEs and in their contribution to GDP, will boost a competitiveness of the manufactured high technology products. The Swiss case will help to improve the mechanisms for integrating academic and university science with government and non-government organizations and SMEs in order to accelerate the commercialization of scientific research and the development of international network cooperation. The development of forms of integration cooperation between financial investors and youth small enterprises, start-up leaders and technology start-ups adapted to the Russian realities will allow to increase the level of interaction between the state in the field of higher education and science with large business and SMEs and to solve the priority tasks of training qualified personnel in innovation-oriented sectors of the economy.",2021,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.15211/soveurope12021108120,C10,1,2021,Journal,0,0,0,0,0,0.138288893,0,0,0,0.111921552,0,0,0,0.434854926,0,0,0,0,0,0.273200992,0.116686783,0,0.014493833,0,0.052874741,0,0.121054876,0,0,0,0.108005792,0.288980197,0,0,0,0,0,0.28153513,0,0,0,0.447314803,0,0,0,0.094987503,0,0.330789345,0.06902277,0,0,0,0,0,0.110090863,0,0.098312954,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.065806738,0,0.113794329,0,0,0.049364156,0,0,0.141774439,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04879349,0,0,0.315350275,0,0,0.03605345,0,0,0,0,0.104269656,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,1,1,28

In making sense of digital transformation, we discovered that leaders in various industry circles use the term inconsistently to describe various strategizing and organizing activities; in addition, the term has gained limited scholarly attention as a context for study of strategic change. Drawing on senior executives' experiences with leading digitalization projects at incumbent firms, we propose a process model comprising of nine microfoundations to reveal the generic contingency factors that trigger, enable, and hinder the building of dynamic capabilities for digital transformation.

It is argued that culture plays a critical role in entrepreneurial behaviour as culture is a key determinant of what it means to be a person. The concept of culture is explored from a micro level of analysis therefore, conceptualising culture from the perspective of the individual entrepreneur's personality. The main research question being investigated within this paper is: whether artisan entrepreneurs share common personality traits with other entrepreneur groups, using the five factor model (FFM) of personality as the basis of the conceptual model presented herein. Design/methodology/approach A literature review on the emerging field of artisan entrepreneurship, followed by a review of the literature on personality theory and entrepreneurship. Then, drawing upon the FFM of personality, a conceptual framework is introduced which proposes a relationship between the Big Five personality traits and four dimensions of artisan entrepreneurship such as cultural heritage, community entrepreneurship, craftsmanship and innovation, developed from concepts derived from extant literature. Findings The theoretical contribution is in the form of propositions. Four propositions have been formulated around the entrepreneurial personality of artisan business owners for each of the four dimensions: cultural heritage, community entrepreneurship, craftsmanship and innovation. Originality/value The paper is the first to propose a relationship between the Big Five personality dimensions and the likelihood of starting and/or running a business among an entrepreneur group rather than explaining personality differences among entrepreneur and non-entrepreneur groups. The focus of the paper is specifically on artisan entrepreneurs and it has been proposed that the personality trait of agreeableness is important in the decision to start a cultural-based business. It has also been proposed that artisan entrepreneurs possess personal characteristics of openness to newness and openness to innovation that are integral to regional development.",2019,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJEBR-02-2018-0099,C6,9,2022,Journal,0,0.419173956,0,0,0,0,0,0.066086433,0.029134288,0,0,0,0,0.066086433,0.041960132,0,0,0,0.101773838,0,0.106399806,0,0.006608036,0.267497115,0,0,0,0.066298059,0,0,0,0,0,0.065666764,0.046403574,0.053349361,0,0.085571769,0,0.062661867,0,0.029134288,0,0,0,0.043306755,0.065046021,0.030162732,0.0314689,0.056964165,0,0.104631136,0.626042457,0,0,0.049646497,0.044822897,0,0,0.055507496,0.035781134,0,0.158708337,0,0,0,0,0.051881174,0,0,0.0675184,0.03689341,0,0,0.171138421,0.112944467,0,0.046527997,0,0,0,0,0.027906397,0,0,0,0.059881994,0,0.410568561,0,0.082187544,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.114925401,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,1,1,28

This study advances our knowledge by developing an innovative model for exploring the impact of knowledge sharing on SPI success, the impact of knowledge sharing in specific organizational cultures, and how the support of top management specifically influences the path to SPI success. To empirically test the model, this study adopts the statistical technique of partial least squares (PLS) to analyze 118 samples collected from SPI-certified Taiwanese organizations. The results suggest that clan-type organizational culture has a stronger association with knowledge sharing than hierarchy-type in the context of SPI success. SPI knowledge sharing is found to be a mediator of both clan culture and top management support in the context of SPI success. The findings also include the implication to improve our knowledge about how organizational culture and top management support drive effective knowledge sharing on the way to SPI success.

A mixed-method design was applied to explore and test the research questions. Semi-structured interviews and survey were conducted, respectively for both the study designs. AI and HR personnel were approached as sample participants for this study. Thematic analysis and PLS-SEM (Partial least squares path modeling) were used to analyze the data, respectively. Positive and significant effects of planned training and development process (0.231 -> 0.021), tactical performance appraisal and integration of AI (0.719 -> 0.000), and integration of AI and efficient HR practices (0.204 -> 0.131) were shown.

While a number of responses to this question have been advanced, we discover that part of the reason could be located in the tacit knowledge (attributed to Polanyi, Hayek) embedded in the marketplace, on which market institutions run. This factor is not fully explored yet. Tacit (idiosyncratic, inarticulate, nonconscious) knowledge is acquired personally through experience and cannot be transferred or conveyed to anyone. This is the knowledge we use to act without knowing it in a propositional form. We present the case of one of India's largest informal footwear cluster, located in the city of Agra. We show that informal markets, hinged on tacit knowledge, cannot evolve easily and therefore may remain locked-in, despite external pressures or incentives to formalize. The study shows that efforts to overcome informality and reaping the benefits of formalized market structures cannot be done without taking cognizance of the sticky intangible knowledge on which these markets rest.",2021,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00191-021-00726-7,C1,7,2022,Journal,0,0,0,0,0.059726199,0.182814334,0,0.095811158,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.08974171,0.045024202,0,0,0.077128452,0,0.009580236,0,0.104848557,0,0,0,0,0.131007679,0.07139043,0.095506083,0,0,0,0,0,0.108553127,0,0.090846271,0,0,0,0,0.077781132,0,0,0.087458989,0,0.247757476,0.060040168,0,0,0.06395793,0.50938044,0,0,0.051874972,0.080704569,0,0,0.057428035,0,0,0,0.043497402,0,0,0,0.593487336,0.032629068,0.035658356,0,0,0.099245606,0,0,0,0,0.052146234,0.042465188,0,0,0.046473047,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.023830863,0,0.306415731,0.056831403,0.212426244,0.068920892,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,1,1,28

The purpose of this paper is to explore Global Suppliers's approach to implementing the GSLCM and examine how its leaders have adopted and applied themodel. Design/methodology/approach - The primary method of data collection in this single, descriptive case research design was interviews with leaders across Global Suppliers. Findings - Results revealed adoption occurred through extensive sensemaking and several methods of knowledge transfer, including storytelling and teaching assignments. Manner of application varied under three themes: development of the self and others, performance management, and creating new paths. Three recommendations to promote further adoption and application emerged: align rewards and recognition, share stories across the enterprise, and embed processes and systems. Research limitations/implications - This study was broadly intended to discern the processes and activities occurring as leaders became exposed to, explored, and integrated the GSLCM, data that was of immediate, practical significance to Global Suppliers in fueling its strategic reorientation.

In particular, the authors deepen the relationship between business model novelty (BMN), business model efficiency (BME), the trade-off between novelty and efficiency - that the authors call BM ambidexterity - and performance. Design/methodology/approach - Data are drawn from a sample of 107 manufacturing and service firms based in a developing country (Albania). Hierarchical regression is used to assess the impact on firm performance from the two BM design themes and their interaction. Findings - The authors find novelty-centred BM design is significantly related to firm performance while efficiency-centred design has no direct effect on performance. However, the authors also find that BME positively moderates the relationship between BMN and firm performance. Research limitations/implications - The relationship between BM design and firm performance can be better understood if contextualised. In the paper, the authors find that different types of BM designs have different impacts on the performance of firms based in a developing economy. While novelty matters, quite surprisingly the authors find no support for efficiency. Additionally, the authors find the interaction between the two design themes (BM ambidexterity) to have a positive impact on firm performance. Practical implications - The surveyed firms based in a developing economy appear to benefit from novelty-centred BM designs. Efficiency-centred designs have a more ambiguous role: while efficiency alone seems not to pay off, an efficient BM design may facilitate the market exploitation of a novel design. Originality/value - This study responds to a precise call for additional quantitative empirical studies on the relationship between BM and performance. The study also contributes to an emerging stream of research focused on BM ambidexterity.",2018,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EJIM-02-2017-0012,C10,4,2018,Journal,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.465059219,0.117155397,0.205192174,0,0,0,0,0.084365472,0.095839703,0.18668513,0.031220522,0.051156881,0,0,0,0,0,0.145407425,0.05532633,0.055484205,0,0,0.090842877,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.053934715,0.043536504,0,0,0,0,0.041632839,0,0,0.04434948,0.555048635,0,0.090121377,0.035970958,0,0,0,0.079643086,0.053183436,0,0,0,0,0.052156411,0,0,0,0.037089135,0,0.064980795,0,0,0,0,0,0.036159056,0.029446059,0,0,0.451152441,0.111819865,0.067040482,0,0.144537418,0,0.051298043,0.066098849,0,0,0.197039144,0.036824962,0,0,0.057767548,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,1,1,28

As salespeople are constantly facing different customers with various needs and want and engaging in a different sales situation, salespeople must deploy their inner capabilities in practicing adaptive selling behavior during and across sales interactions. This study also investigates the impact of salesperson's intrapersonal leadership - where leadership stems from the individuals with the purpose to influence oneself. Design/methodology/approach Authors draw on the social cognitive theory of self-regulation to develop our model and examine the relationship between self-monitoring, thought self-leadership and adaptive selling behavior. We empirically test the model using data from 335 pharmaceutical salespeople working across several countries in Asia. Findings The results support the role of self-monitoring and thought self-leadership as antecedents to adaptive selling. Further, the results suggest that self-monitoring positively moderates the relationship between thought self-leadership and adaptive selling behavior. In light of these results, we explore implications and limitations and conclude by suggesting directions for further research. Research limitations/implications - The sampling method used was convenience sampling, which may limit the theoretical generalization of our results across all emerging markets. Moreover, this study examines the direct impact of self-management mechanism on adaptive selling behavior and the way it interacts with salesperson's thought self- leadership to strengthen adaptive selling behavior. However, the research model does not include organization-level drivers. Originality/value This study makes an important and original contribution to sales literature by demonstrating the direct and interaction effects of self-monitoring mechanism on a critical component of a business to business sales process, adaptive selling behavior. Results from this study highlight the critical importance of cognitive processes that drives positive selling behavior.",2020,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JBIM-06-2019-0302,C1,6,2017,Journal,0,0,0,0,0.126916712,0,0,0,0.089755716,0,0,0,0.085993683,0,0,0,0,0,0.078385164,0,0,0.07903652,0,0.082409412,0.111400309,0,0.085015708,0,0,0,0.151702917,0,0,0,0.285916443,0,0,0.016476624,0.085502606,0,0,0.179511431,0.204248336,0,0,0,0.200391106,0.046462053,0.048474046,0,0,0,0,0,0.077315784,0.076474443,0,0,0,0,0.165349568,0,0.325961412,0,0,0,0,0.079916693,0,0,0.06933597,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.21501231,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.075960002,0,0,0.301913352,0,0,0.625357461,0.088514362,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,1,1,28

Sustainability learning refers to knowledge produced to address environmental risks. Design/methodology/approach - Case study design highlighting the personal experience of participants in relation to sustainability learning. Data collected through seven face-to-face, semi-structured interviews during a six-week fieldwork. Purposive sampling was used, and recruitment was carried out through the snow balling method. Deductive and inductive logic were used in data analysis. Findings - Sustainability-focused learning only took place informally in the organization studied. The organization did not have formal systems to embed sustainability learning in its rules, processes and practices. It was also found that organizational politics acted as an impediment to sustainability learning, as people in power often blocked support for sustainability related initiatives. Research limitations/implications - Data would have been richer if more than one case study was developed, as this would have enabled inter-organizational comparisons and richer analysis. Practical implications - This research is useful for practitioners, as it contributes to a better understanding of desirable sustainability learning practices and processes, and challenges that prevent it from occurring effectively in organizations. Social implications - This research contributes to a better understanding of sustainability learning in an emerging economy such as Brazil. The implementation of sustainability learning practices in emerging economies poses particular challenges given their emphasis on economic growth. Understanding these challenges can enable managers working with sustainability to formulate better strategies to ensure a smoother transition to a sustainable future. Originality/value - The originality of this research is twofold: first, it examines sustainability learning in the specific context of a government institution in an emerging economy; second, it draws attention to organizational politics as a major impediment to the systematic implementation of sustainability learning practices.",2017,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJOA-02-2015-0842,C12,1,2022,Article,0,0,0.114128118,0,0,0.111671937,0,0.117052284,0,0,0,0,0.098879535,0,0.074319781,0,0,0,0,0,0.094227662,0.090879865,0,0,0.085395503,0,0,0,0,0,0.087217533,0,0.091383951,0,0.328760019,0.283477148,0,0.151564708,0,0,0,0.206410589,0,0,0,0,0,0.053424228,0.055737712,0,0,0,0,0,0.71121026,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.187402793,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.039862861,0.021781868,0.106380008,0.114486608,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.039402033,0.118115474,0,0,0.10388557,0,0.029114114,0,0,0.069430802,0,0.084200505,0.17976627,0,0,0.079601491,1,,,,,,,,,1,1,28

In addressing this gap, two related questions guided our investigation: (1) How do organizations experience and resolve contradictory tensions throughout the evolution of digital infrastructure? and (2) What can we learn about the organizational capabilities that drive strategic actions in resolving these contradictory tensions? We approach these questions using an in-depth case study at RE/MAX LLC, a global real estate franchise. Based on our findings, we propose a theoretical model of digital infrastructure ambidexterity. The model recognizes three pairs of capabilities (identifying and germinating, expanding and legitimizing, and augmenting and implanting) and two supporting factors (leadership and structure) that are key to resolving contradictory tensions during this evolution.

The analysis is structured following established procedures for inductive, theory-building research, using guidelines for constant comparison techniques and working recursively between the data and the emerging theory. Findings - Two processes were found important to understand the women entrepreneurs' growth mode.

The modern entrepreneurial approach is, therefore, more and more focused on the identification and actualization of new opportunities, like emerging on the international scene, rather than being based on a rational combination of know-how and of marketing expectations. Nowadays, the phenomena of internationalization affects every type of organization: private and public, for-profit and nonprofit, and large and small. As a consequence of the above, international entrepreneurship (IE) has recently emerged as a research field and this article aims at exploring some its implications. IE may be considered a set of new and innovative activities aiming at the creation of value and growth beyond national borders, by the combination of innovative, proactive, and risk-seeking behaviors that crosses national borders. In this context, we focus on a specific case: knowledge-based firms. In order to achieve this scope, after a preliminary section delineating the research field, we have developed our study in a number of steps that approach the research topic. Firstly, we explore and summarize the literature about research on the emerging area of international entrepreneurship. Then, we present the accumulated knowledge stemming from the relationship between knowledge and internationalization, looking at the phenomena of international start-ups. After this, we explore international entrepreneurship by academic context, identifying the main factors that influence the choice of the market on the part of the knowledge-based firms. Lastly, we characterize knowledge-based entrepreneurship as a virtuous combination of knowledge and entrepreneurship. Finally, we draw conclusions identifying the factors able to boost capacities for such expansion of firms originating from innovation and that have operations suited to a widely ultra-national context.",2018,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13132-016-0352-1,C3,7,2021,Journal,0,0,0.297903779,0,0,0,0,0,0.134696199,0,0,0,0,0,0.096996884,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.118609926,0,0,0.055726064,0,0.12758288,0,0,0.104444102,0,0,0.238535646,0,0,0,0,0.148358595,0,0,0.124720777,0.673480996,0.153257507,0,0,0,0,0,0.072744891,0,0,0,0,0,0.116027621,0.114765023,0.207229155,0.082713241,0,0,0.082713241,0,0,0.143527655,0,0.138710863,0,0.239861601,0,0,0.104052333,0.028428143,0,0,0,0,0,0.107556162,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.181232274,0,0.109892501,0.117309065,0,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,1,1,28

Design/methodology/approach - The authors study PI practices in six engineering-oriented SMEs via interview-based case studies. The authors draw from a range of literature and use an OL conceptual framework informed by Crossan et al.'s (1999) 4I framework as an analytical lens. Findings - The OL perspective provides new insights to conceptualise the nature of PI as a multi-level practice in SMEs. Effective PI practices within SMEs are shown to be consistent with OL concepts, enabling firms to translate individually identified improvement opportunities into organisational-level changes that result in sustained benefits. A new conceptual model is presented that explains how SMEs can learn through improvement activities. The key role of management support, both operational and strategic, is highlighted. It is necessary for management to provide sufficient PI opportunities to enable and sustain beneficial learning. Research limitations/implications - The study is based on a sample of engineering-oriented SMEs located in the UK. Further case-based, longitudinal, and survey-based research studies with firms of different types will enhance the generalisability of the findings, allowing the confirmation and extension of the new conceptual model. Practical implications - The findings provide a theoretically underpinned framework for achieving OL in engineering-oriented SMEs through PI activities. The new model highlights the key mechanisms that enable learning from improvement activities. The findings highlight the key role played by management in introducing additional learning opportunities in the form of new business that requires exploratory learning. Without this, the reduction in improvement opportunities reduces the benefits that can be realised from PI.

However, with a focus on the production system side of industrial cluster, the extant studies less explore the root of the above mixed findings from the knowledge system side of clusters. Thus, this study aims to establish a coherent theoretical framework to reconcile the mixed findings on the relationship between spatial crowdedness and cluster-level patenting performance. Specifically, we expect a U-shaped relationship between spatial crowdedness and cluster-level patenting performance. From a perspective of knowledge based view, we argue that the interplay of two underlying mechanisms, i.e. knowledge spillover exploitation and knowledge safeguarding, will lead to this U-shaped relationship. We also propose the moderation effect of technological complexity on this U-shaped relationship.

Whereas the SDGs' predecessors, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), were specifically formulated for governmental adoption, the SDGs stand apart in inviting diverse stakeholders, including private industry, to participate in sustainable development. Literature is emerging about how private industry can engage in the SDG framework. We aim to contribute to the sustainability and cross-sector partnership literatures by examining the motivations of organizations that partner into SDG platforms. This research started as an exploratory study to understand how corporations use the SDGs strategically, and we identified platforms as a means of strategic corporate engagement with the SDGs. Our findings are based on semi-structured interviews and documents, and they focus on four Danish SDG platforms: UNLEASH, Hello Science, Fra Filantropi til Forretning (From Philanthropy to Business), and the SDG Accelerator. The findings suggest that speed, impact, and scaling of SDG innovations are features of SDG platforms that motivate cross-sector, boundary-spanning collaboration. We suggest that the larger ambition of the platforms is to shift the value framing from profit outputs to SDG impacts and outcomes, ultimately imagined as a business landscape based on SDG innovation; and we propose a model to reflect the SDG platform process structure.",2022,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10551-022-05194-y,C4,9,2021,Article,0,0.679248011,0,0.055703994,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.057721589,0,0.060345232,0.058201237,0.007495568,0,0.027344473,0,0,0,0,0,0.055855809,0,0.117048128,0,0.105272163,0,0,0.024266248,0.06296276,0,0,0.033047341,0.075202615,0,0.121711778,0,0,0,0.071391035,0,0.046975374,0.059342122,0,0.050040628,0,0,0.203372409,0,0,0.188888281,0.040586932,0.044931643,0.120016402,0,0,0,0.074015813,0.117698767,0,0,0.025528953,0.027899066,0,0.073319456,0.504722879,0,0.062783107,0.052777216,0,0.040799167,0.033224726,0,0.031654532,0.03636047,0,0.075643453,0,0,0,0.173642598,0.093226231,0,0,0,0.041550526,0,0.057562912,0.13036114,0,0.050978347,1,,,,,,,,,1,1,28

Design/methodology/approach - By means of structural equation modeling with latent variables, a new type of synthetic index is developed, with which the evolution and incidence of human capital structure, human resources development, and R&D in the company's accumulated resiliency can be tested. Findings - The results indicate a remarkable contribution of human capital to company resilience (standardized path coefficient 0.8365; po0.0001 and R-2 = 0.7486). Differences in company- nurtured resilience are related to categories such as productivity, products diversification, human capital structure, human resources management, innovation results, technology, and a productive environment. Research limitations/implications - The main limitation is that the applied literature on this topic is scarce in economics and focused on company survival. Practical implications - Management for resilience requires the development of the ability to balance efficiency in the short term with adaptability in the medium and long term. Recruitment and training and development policies should consider the role of emotions and motivation in creative thinking and innovation.

Design/methodology/approach - There is hardly any study on emerging economies that explored the causal chain of R&D-innovation-productivity, considering the role of market power in a structural model. Taking advantage of the availability of firm-level data and following the extended version of the Crepon, Duguet and Mairesse (CDM) model, we intend to fill the gap. The CDM model first explores the link between R&D and innovation, then the latter's impact on productivity. Besides, it captures sectoral heterogeneity and the differing roles of technological and institutional innovation on productivity. Findings - The manufacturing firms that held a higher markup had a more significant contribution to driving innovation than services one. While institutional innovation affected productivity positively, technological innovation had the opposite impact. Nevertheless, firms' higher degree of monopoly, in general, worsened productivity outcomes. The estimated results are robust to a range of alterations. Practical implications - The study offers implications for the competition policy of ASEAN.

In this paper we pose three research questions to explore how innovation can further our understanding of hydrological processes, if working towards the sustainable development goals (SDGs) provides a helpful focus, and whether specific mechanisms can be used to facilitate innovation and research into hydrological processes. First, we examine key aspects of innovation and explore innovation in the context of water security. We then present a series of innovation projects to determine their effectiveness in delivering innovation in managing hydrological processes, but also their contribution to scientific understanding. Our research suggests that product and process innovation were more closely related to increasing scientific understanding of hydrological processes than other forms of innovation.

It forges a link between the literatures on cluster development and regional innovation systems (RISs), and explores both conceptually and empirically how cluster evolution is shaped by regional context conditions, including changes in the policy support structure and the knowledge base configuration of the RIS. We use qualitative research methods and descriptive statistics to analyse the development and transformation of the ICT cluster. Cluster emergence was enabled by strong analytical and synthetic knowledge bases in the region. The global crisis and changing geography of the ICT industry triggered a transformation of the cluster towards a new growth path with stronger symbolic components. Cluster transformation was facilitated by policy actions that promoted a diversification of knowledge bases in the region. The strategy was to combine existing competences in ICT with new competences in media and design, and to develop new activities around the theme of New Media, which integrates analytical, synthetic and symbolic knowledge. We show that the endowment of the RIS of a variety of knowledge bases and their combination has essentially supported long-term cluster development and transformation.",2017,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/04353684.2017.1344559,C14,1,2022,Journal,0.110989951,0.104441242,0,0,0,0,0,0.345787541,0,0,0.599583455,0,0.097367633,0,0.073183406,0,0,0,0.177505545,0,0.092786889,0.08949028,0,0,0.084089776,0,0,0,0,0.15760455,0.085883947,0,0,0,0.080933291,0,0,0.205214943,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.093572075,0.151064152,0,0,0.054885463,0.298056616,0.072229382,0,0,0.076942519,0,0,0,0.062406506,0.097089021,0,0.124813013,0.06908694,0,0.216581032,0.203993068,0,0,0,0,0,0.039253344,0.042897632,0,0.112736069,0,0.098494219,0,0,0,0.06273284,0.051086371,0,0,0.055907896,0,0.174464172,0,0.083586647,0,0,0.028668949,0,0,0,0.12777626,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,1,1,23

Additionally, this research also seeks to explore the moderating effect of information sharing in the association between BDU and technological innovation. Design/methodology/approach Using survey methods and structural associations in AMOS 24.0., the proposed model was tested on SME managers recruited from the largest economic and manufacturing hub of China, Pearl River Delta. Findings The findings suggest that BDU is positively related to technological innovation (product and process) and organizational outcomes (e.g., supply chain and SMEs performance). Technological innovation (i.e., product and process) significantly mediates the association between BDU and organizational outcomes. Moreover, information sharing positively moderates the association between BDU and technological innovations. Practical implications This research provides deeper insights into how BDU is useful for SME managers in achieving the firm's goals. Particularly, SME managers can bring technological innovation into their business processes, overcome the challenges of forecasting, and generate dynamic capabilities for attaining the best SMEs' performance. Additionally, BDU with information sharing enables SMEs reduce their risk and decrease production costs in their manufacturing process. Originality/value Firms always need to adopt new ways to enhance their productivity using available resources. This is the first study that contributes to big data and performance management literature by exploring the moderating and mediation mechanism of information sharing and technological innovation respectively using RBVT. The study and research model enhances our insights on BDU, information sharing, and technological innovation as valuable resources for organizations to improve supply chain performance, which subsequently increases SME productivity.

Despite scholars' growing interest in both these research streams, scarce consideration is given to the comprehension of their mutual implications and meaning. Design/methodology/approach The paper is based on a cross-case analysis. It compares 16 higher education programmes launched by Universities in Europe aimed to create competences and skills for Circular Economy in students with different profiles. The analysis provides a critical view of the emerging trends for the entrepreneurship education skills and competencies needed for the emerging circular entrepreneurship paradigm. Findings The paper discusses the main trends of Entrepreneurship Education focused on Circular Economy debate at the European level: rationale and learning objectives (why); contents (what), target students and stakeholders (who) and the learning processes (how). Four thematic areas are identified as common patterns: circular economy business model, green supply chain management, technology entrepreneurship and innovation and public policies and institutional frameworks. Research limitations/implications The paper sheds new light on a still under-researched area, suggesting several implications and avenues for future research in Circular Economy and Entrepreneurship Education. Limitations regard the need to analyse education programmes from a larger geographical area, to take into consideration interesting experiences in the rest of the world and to also collect quantitative data. Practical implications Practical implications arise for the development of learning initiatives for the Circular Economy: learning objectives and new thematic areas focused on circular, sustainable and innovative rethinking of the process for creating value in the incumbent companies; exploring meaning and benefits of collaborative approaches and participation in the circular economy innovation ecosystem and developing advanced models for soft-skills development in terms of leadership, motivational and creative skills.

Our study addresses this research gap by investigating the relationships among OC, inbound and outbound OI, innovation ecosystems and innovative performance. With data collected from 169 companies in Brazil, our main results show that adhocracy culture is the type of OC that most influences the adoption of inbound and outbound OI flows, and that hierarchy culture discourages the adoption of OI.

In this regard, the key innovation challenges that enterprises face are liabilities associated with their age and size, and the entry barriers imposed on them. In this line, a growing number of enterprises are starting to implement innovation practices in which they employ both internal/external flows of knowledge in order to explore/exploit innovation in collaboration with commercial or scientific agents. Within this context, universities play a significant role providing fertile knowledge-intensive environments to support the exploration and exploitation of innovative and entrepreneurial ideas, especially in emerging economies, where governments have created subsidies to promote enterprise innovation through compulsory university partnerships. Based on these ideas, the purpose of this exploratory research is to provide a better understanding about the role of universities on enterprises' innovation practices in emerging economies. More concretely, in the context of Mexico, we explored the enterprises' motivations to collaborate with universities in terms of innovation purposes (exploration and exploitation) or alternatives to access to public funds (compulsory requirement of being involved in a university partnership). Using a sample of 10,167 Mexican enterprises in the 2012 Research and Technological Development Survey collected by the Mexican National Institute of Statistics and Geography, we tested a multinomial regression model.

More recent research has shifted the focus from organizational level exploration and exploitation to the individual in order to understand psychological micro-foundations of individual ambidexterity. However, our current knowledge on how knowledge flows within individual ambidexterity are initiated and affect performance outcomes is limited. This study thus strives to shed light on the topic by introducing two mechanisms, namely ambidextrous knowledge seeking and ambidextrous knowledge offering, that capture how knowledge flows within individual ambidexterity are initiated. Based on survey-data from 415 employees, findings from structural equation modeling provide first empirical evidence that the focal constructs significantly affect knowledge accumulation on the department level as well as its performance. Finally, results from additional moderation analysis indicate, that ambidextrous knowledge offering leads to higher performance effects in environments characterized by the pursuit of radical innovations, while ambidextrous knowledge seeking is rather suited for environments with a focus on innovating incrementally.",2020,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10961-020-09781-x,C10,4,2019,Article,0,0,0,0,0.117969312,0,0,0.189243189,0,0,0,0,0.079931283,0,0,0.068248876,0.088627503,0,0.072859151,0,0.076170848,0,0,0.153199393,0.138062383,0,0,0,0,0.064690563,0,0,0,0,0,0.229154519,0,0.153150518,0,0,0.077249524,0,0.094924598,0,0.076815425,0,0,0.129559685,0.045056713,0,0.059294727,0,0,0.063163847,0,0,0,0.051230907,0,0.158949652,0.102461814,0.11343005,0.757454298,0,0,0.04295735,0,0,0,0.083731253,0.032223955,0.052823448,0.085994443,0.092547579,0,0.080856123,0.079248058,0,0.143337144,0.051498802,0.083875906,0,0.039955974,0.045896051,0.031851435,0.047740523,0.085738168,0,0,0,0.047069972,0,0,0.168377403,0,0.068065191,0,0,0,0.064347484,,,,,,,,,,1,1,23

Findings - This study finds that managerial ties take effect through two paths: one direct path and one indirect path. First, managerial ties can impact BMI directly through exploitative and explorative learning. Second, managerial ties can impact BMI indirectly through explorative learning and opportunity recognition. Practical implications - First, firm managers from transition economies should learn to reinvent their business models by taking full advantage of managerial ties. Second, firm managers should take appropriate actions to transfer managerial ties into BMI. Originality/value - This study contributes to existing literature in two major ways.

The status of IT innovation study is analysed through citation analysis with the help of CiteSpace. Influential references, hot topics, top-tier journals and important institutes are all detected, and the intellectual structure of recent studies is also mapped in this study, and we find that research on IT innovation is mainly from two directions, innovation study group and information systems study group.

Therefore, it is of great significance to explore the impact of entrepreneurial leadership on enterprises' technological innovation. OBJECTIVE: From the perspective of technological innovation stream, we divide ambidextrous innovation into mainstream innovation and new stream innovation. Integrating ambidexterity theory, innovation streams theory and cognitive affective personality system theory (CAPS), we explore the mediating mechanism of entrepreneurial ambidextrous leadership on ambidextrous innovation from cognitive path, affective path and cognitive-affective compound path. METHODS: Based on the data collected from 254 top managers in 12 provinces in China, we conducted descriptive statistical analysis, reliability and validity analysis, regression analysis and bootstrap mediating effect test on the sample data. RESULTS: Our empirical results revealed that: 1) entrepreneurial ambidextrous leadership positively related with the ambidextrous innovation; 2) organizational paradoxical cognition plays a partly mediating role between ambidextrous leadership and ambidextrous innovation; 3) organizational affective conflict plays a partly mediating role between ambidextrous leadership and ambidextrous innovation; 4) organizational paradoxical cognition negatively related with organizational affective conflict; 5) organizational paradoxical cognition and organizational affective conflict play a chain mediating role between entrepreneurial ambidextrous leadership and ambidextrous innovation.

The path and boundary conditions through which search strategies affect intra-organizational knowledge creation remain elusive. Drawing on recombinant search theory and knowledge-based view, the authors seek to identify knowledge complexity as an important intermediate variable between knowledge search and innovation performance, such as research and development (R&D) output and R&D output quality. A second goal of this study is to examine the moderating roles of government support and technological turbulence. Design/methodology/approach The authors employed a longitudinal panel of 609 global pharmaceutical firms and obtained the firms' patent records from 1980 to 2015 for the analysis. The authors used generalized estimating equations (GEE) to evaluate the models and tested the consistency via panel fixed-effects estimations. Findings The authors' findings show that organizational routine-guided search has a negative effect on knowledge complexity, while routine-changing search exerts a positive impact on knowledge complexity. Governmental support and technological turbulence moderate these relationships. Notably, knowledge complexity has an inverted U-shaped relationship with innovation performance. Research limitations/implications The authors' research context, the pharmaceutical industry, may constrain the generalizability of our findings. In addition, potential types of routine-guided and routine-changing search behaviors were not considered. Practical implications Despite these limitations, this study offers important implications. First, knowledge complexity transmits the effects of knowledge search on innovation performance. Practitioners should balance routine-guided and routine-changing search processes to build and manage complex knowledge. Second, a moderate level of knowledge complexity is the key to good R&D output and R&D output quality.

This paper examines the value of alliance portfolio diversity and whether R&D human capital is the pathway through which alliance portfolio diversity influences innovation novelty. We reason that the absorptive capacity of R&D human capital determines a firm's potential gains from highly diverse alliance portfolios. Using data from the Spanish Technological Innovation Panel (PITEC) for the period 2005-2012, results support the curvilinear (inverted U-shaped) association between alliance portfolio diversity and firm innovation performance reported in studies, suggesting that not only too little, but also too much alliance portfolio diversity may be detrimental to firm innovation performance. Findings emphasise the value of alliance portfolio diversity in high-technology industries to achieve explorative performance objectives, given the technological complexity, market uncertainty and the divergent skill sets required for breakthrough innovations in these sectors. Further, we find evidence that R&D human capital plays an important role in innovation novelty by partially mediating the relationship between alliance partner diversity and firm innovation performance, emphasising the importance of internal capabilities to harness external knowledge assets. This study provides valuable insights to managers aiming to increase the effectiveness of their alliance portfolios. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Although a substantial body of research has emphasized that top management's transformational leadership is crucial to innovation, the mechanisms through which strategic leaders influence these distinct types of innovations remain unclear. Building on upper echelon and social learning theory, this study develops and empirically examines a model that investigates the mediating roles of three distinct strategic orientations (market, learning, and entrepreneurial orientation) on the relationship between transformational leadership and exploratory and exploitative innovation. Using meta-analytic methods combined with structural equation modeling, this study integrates findings from separate research streams, covering over 15 years of research, and using a sample of 215 effect sizes from 75 studies. The results from the partial mediation model reveal that transformational leaders play a key role in creating these specific strategic orientations which, in turn, support different innovation outcomes. Specifically, the findings indicate that transformational leaders promote exploitative innovations predominantly by building a market orientation, whereas they foster exploratory innovations by stimulating an entrepreneurial and a learning orientation. Hence, this study extends upper echelon research by uncovering the different mechanisms through which transformational leaders promote exploratory and exploitative innovations as it theoretically identifies and empirically validates the unique mediating roles of three specific strategic orientations. The results thus provide valuable insights for the challenging management of exploratory and exploitative innovations, as they provide a guiding map which reveals how transformational leaders from the top may use specific orientations to foster these distinct types of innovations.",2016,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpim.12335,C3,4,2017,Journal,0,0,0,0,0.071899974,0,0,0,0.050847784,0,0,0,0.097433088,0.115339999,0,0,0,0,0.177624873,0.108694878,0.092849265,0.17910088,0.069197642,0,0.042073153,0,0,0.115709348,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.080987699,0.093110113,0,0.149347562,0,0,0.188328259,0,0.115709348,0.511460572,0,0,0,0.052642719,0,0.099418995,0.144555876,0,0,0.076994243,0,0,0.391144793,0,0,0.096876685,0,0.138266766,0,0,0,0.104726639,0.113883295,0,0,0.306195304,0.117839196,0.021463235,0,0,0.059737239,0,0,0,0,0.062775012,0.153362141,0,0,0.05594548,0,0,0,0.167285677,0,0,0.086064665,0.099707729,0,0.273660568,0,0,0,0.100289083,0,0,,,,,,,,,,1,1,42

While several researchers have noted a need to develop a better theoretical understanding of the mechanisms explaining the interplay between absorptive capacity and innovation, we provide theoretical explanations of the underlying mechanism and further offer explanations as to why some firms are better able to convert external knowledge into strategic innovations when compared with others. The implications of these findings for theory and practice are delineated.",2020,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/emre.12320,C9,4,2019,Journal,0.106646657,0,0.323955751,0.082298813,0,0.105661272,0,0,0.04882517,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.085279671,0,0.089155923,0,0.011074185,0,0.080799149,0,0,0,0,0.151437119,0.08252311,0,0,0,0,0.447031977,0,0.125480987,0,0,0.090418486,0.439426534,0.111106682,0,0.179820767,0,0,0.050548706,0.105475336,0.286392972,0.069402879,0.087673897,0,0.14786316,0.084116232,0,0.075117181,0,0,0,0,0.066383408,0.177315967,0,0,0.100560841,0.218706531,0,0,0,0.03771727,0.020609474,0.100654177,0.108324446,0,0.094639912,0,0,0.083886132,0.060277959,0.049087243,0,0.04676739,0.05372009,0.037281246,0.11175799,0,0.080315709,0,0,0.027547067,0,0.059033074,0.065693737,0.184164119,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,1,1,42

By analyzing an interorganizational relationship in which both vendor and client try to develop new products and services with BDA, this research examines the conditions under which BDA prompts organizations to explore novel innovation processes. Over the course of this longitudinal case study, the partners find that a service-dominant logic around capturing value no longer applies. Rather, the uncertainty of BDA innovation prompts a learning logic around creating value through collective experimentation. To explain these changes to the logic for innovation and interorganizational processes, we report four discoveries about the relationship between organizational learning under uncertainty, collective experimentation, and innovation trajectory shifts with BDA.

We explore the nexus between risk and innovation, reporting on data arising from a primary school in Australia, built as part of one state government's Private Public Partnership initiatives.

IoT is expected to play a significant role in the future industry 4.0 platform. Yet, little is known about how SMEs in the IoT industry (IoT-SMEs hereafter) pursue innovation in alignment with attributes inherent in the IoT. Design/methodology/approach - This study addresses relatively unexplored key research questions on innovation strategies of IoT-SMEs. To do so, we employ an exploratory research methodology, along with an extensive review of the literature in the areas of the IoT, SMEs innovation and sustainable growth strategy. Specifically, we conduct intensive individual interviews to find IoT inherent innovation attributes and a case study to explore the process of linking these attributes to innovation-driving paths. Findings - The analysis results reveal that there exist disruptive and open innovation attributes in the IoT industry that enable IoT-SMEs to enhance their structure and process related capabilities, to create business models for products and services and to collaborate with external parties in marketing to enter the market. We excavate practical insights into driving innovation based on IoT attributes and suggest enabling paths for pursuing innovation and entering overseas markets for IoT-SMEs. Originality/value - This study investigates an underexplored significant area of research on the relationship between IoT attributes and innovation paths.

At the same time, in-depth digitalization has greatly unlocked the potential for innovation. Business model innovation has become a key path for enterprises to gain competitive advantage. However, the innovative situation in the digital age poses new challenges to the enterprises' strategic change decision-making. How do enterprises sharply capture and quickly adapt to the dynamic changes of the environment, and further use business model innovation to achieve the strategic goal of achieving excellent performance, which is not only an important issue of concern to the theoretical scholars, but also a secret that enterprises' management decision-making practices are constantly exploring. This study investigates how enterprises can achieve high levels of enterprise performance under different configurations of strategic orientation and business model innovation, which introduces efficiency-centered and novelty-centered business model innovation as mediator, and a theoretical framework of strategic orientation-business model innovation-enterprise performance was established to explore the realization path of the strategic orientation's effect mechanism on enterprise performance. It uses 245 data from Xi'an, Chengdu, Chongqing, and other high-level enterprise managers in Northwest China as samples, besides that partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) are used for empirical analysis of the data.

These studies also attach great importance to the antecedent and moderate, mediating, and control variables of innovation ambidexterity. However, only few researchers addressed the mechanisms or criteria of resource allocation for establishing a balance between exploitation and exploration. Previous studies showed that the allocation proportion of enterprise resources is associated with performance gap between the targeted performance and actual performance. These studies also showed that exploitative innovation and exploratory innovation can increase the level of knowledge and promote performance development. On the basis of the behavioral theory of the firm and resource-based view, this article investigates that resource allocation is affected by the relative performance rather than absolute levels of performance and how firm performance evolves from the creativity revelation processes through knowledge by balancing exploration and exploitation for established firms. A simulation is conducted. The result shows that exploratory innovation-oriented firms have better long-term performance than exploitative innovation-oriented firms.

Design/methodology/approach - The mHealth and Wellness Innovation Ecosystem building (Botha, Herselman, & Kotz, 2016) is an initiative embarked on in 2015 and entails the exploration, mapping, description and stimulation of mHealth and Wellness Innovations in the South African National Innovation System. The outcome was envisioned as a stimulus in the South African mHealth and Wellness Domain and as supporting the National Innovation System of South Africa. The DEMOLA Model was the chosen innovation mechanism that would be used to stimulate and catalyse the mHealth and Innovation Ecosystem as it facilitates youth involvement, industry co-creation, and network formation and has a reported high percentage of global licencing. The execution in South Africa would be the initial implementation envisaged to guide further implementations into the rest of the African continent. Transferring models from Europe to Africa would necessitate a significant amount of contextualisation. Much of the DEMOLA model has been lived by their facilitators and the resulting complex multifaceted knowledge have become entrenched in the Model. Site visits were supplemented with semi structured interviews in two sites, DEMOLA Tampere and Oulu. The interviews and visits were used towards explicitly describing the tacit knowledge resources that would need to be evaluated for contextualisation and how the South African environment can absorb this learning. Originality/value -The identified knowledge resources would position the local African implementers to effectively adapt the Innovation model and provide a common language and understanding between the stakeholders. Towards further adoption into Africa the same procedure can be followed. Practical implications - The clear presentation of knowledge resources entangled as explicit and well as tacit components would enable stakeholders to manage knowledge resources more effectively and provide the potential for full deliberate, systematic knowledge management and transfer.",2017,Conference Paper,,C7,8,2021,Journal,0,0,0,0,0.118972848,0,0,0,0.084137802,0.294726813,0.16546623,0.173971367,0,0,0,0.137658906,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0381671,0,0.139236847,0,0,0,0.179857357,0,0.142207656,0.380490671,0,0,0.134010301,0,0,0.030890666,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.090879999,0.329017115,0.119598265,0,0,0.127402333,0,0.143375638,0.258890832,0,0,0,0.103333432,0.228789944,0,0,0,0,0.188442627,0,0,0,0,0.106545609,0,0.186669717,0.098847177,0.163087893,0,0.268739254,0,0.103873779,0.084589418,0,0.080591739,0.092572955,0,0.09629328,0,0,0,0.147363407,0.047470385,0,0,0.113206499,0.105786722,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,1,1,42

From the perspective of the relation attributes between knowledge elements, this paper divides knowledge cross-border searching into two types: domain knowledge searching and architectural knowledge coupling searching. Then, we construct a system dynamics model and use Vensim PLE software to carry out simulation analysis to explore the differential mechanisms of knowledge cross-border searching influence firms' dual innovation in the context of digital transformation. The analysis results show that domain knowledge searching positively affects firms' iterative innovation, while there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between architectural knowledge searching and firms' disruptive innovation, indicating that different types of knowledge cross-border searching have differential effects on firms' dual innovation. The simulation results also address that digital resources can promote enterprises' dual innovation in the process of knowledge cross-border searching.

This paper aims to figure out whether and how knowledge recombination (recombinant exploration/recombinant exploitation) affects firms' innovation quality (technological value/economic value) and how these relationships are moderated by environmental turbulence (technological turbulence/market turbulence) in the context of open innovation. Design/methodology/approach A panel data set is built on 373 Chinese pharmaceutical firms' patents and new product data from 1997 to 2020. And a negative binomial regression model is applied to test the hypotheses. Findings The analyses indicate that (1) recombinant exploration favors technological value but hinders economic value, while (2) recombinant exploitation benefits both. Regarding environmental turbulence's moderating effects, (3) technological turbulence has opposite moderating effects on the impacts of recombinant exploration versus exploitation on technological value, whereas (4) market turbulence benefits the impacts of both on economic value. Practical implications This research provides the answer to practitioners' question that How to improve innovation quality? That is Think from a recombination logic, clarify your internal value preference and the external turbulence. Originality/value From an emerging perspective of innovation, this research expands the innovation quality research to a recombination logic.

Innovative sociotechnical design artifacts involve digital information technologies (IT) being used in ways that result in profound disruptions to traditional ways of doing business and to widespread societal changes. The pervasiveness of DI means that the individuals involved in bringing it about have diverse backgrounds, including application specialists, software engineers, data scientists, business managers, economists, venture capitalists, various user groups, and entrepreneurial leaders. This range of backgrounds means that DI, much more than traditional innovation, leads to varied perspectives on the methods and tools to be used in the development of effective and evolvable complex systems incorporating digital innovations. In this paper we present a new matrix approach to DI based on DSR, entrepreneurship, and innovation theories. Clear strategic guidance allows these multiple stakeholders to make sense of the diverse landscape and to understand when and how different entrepreneurial strategies for innovation can best be applied. We define the combined DSR and DI matrix approach in terms of four strategies: invention; advancement; exaptation; and exploitation and their associated DI practices. The research contribution is a novel DSR-DI matrix process model.

This study observes two knowledge gaps in the quest for SPI success and proposes a research model that integrates existing knowledge antecedents to address these gaps. Based on organizational learning theory and the dynamic capability view, the proposed model consolidates a firm's absorptive capacity (AC), learning ability in terms of exploration and exploitation and knowledge sharing (KS), and it examines the contextual relationships among these knowledge antecedents on the path to SPI success. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative research design is implemented to examine the model with a sample of 138 SPI-certified organizations in Taiwan and Mainland China. The partial least squares (PLS) technique is used for the data analysis. Findings The results reveal the following findings. First, AC triggers the effect of exploration/exploitation on SPI success. Second, KS fosters exploitation but has an insignificant influence on exploration. Third, KS can promote AC, and it serves as the sourcing mechanism for all of the knowledge antecedents. Overall, an integrative set of knowledge learning routes is presented in guiding software firms on the way to SPI success.

This article discusses the benefits and constraints of machine learning approaches in industry level patent analysis, and to this end offers a demonstration of unsupervised learning based analysis of the leading telecommunication firms between 2001 and 2014 based on about 160,000 USPTO full-text patents. Data were classified using full-text descriptions with Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and latent patterns emerging through the unsupervised learning process were modelled by company and year to create an overall view of patenting within the industry, and to forecast future trends. Our results demonstrate company-specific differences in their knowledge profiles, as well as show the evolution of the knowledge profiles of industry leaders from hardware to software focussed technology strategies. The results cast also light on the dynamics of emerging and declining knowledge areas in the telecommunication industry. Our results prompt a consideration of the current status of established approaches to patent landscaping, such as key-word or technology classifications and other approaches relying on semantic labelling, in the context of novel machine learning approaches. Finally, we discuss implications for policy makers, and, in particular, for strategic management in firms. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper builds a coevolution analysis framework in stages and constructs structural equation models for empirical tests using the Chinese technology-sourcing overseas M&A events that occurred from 2001 to 2012. Findings - Overseas M&A integration and knowledge network reconfiguration are in a coevolutionary relationship, driving industrial technology innovation. The acquirer adopts initial integration degree that matches the resource relatedness between the acquiring and acquired parties, promoting initial industrial technology innovation through initial knowledge network reconfiguration. Initial knowledge network reconfiguration will feed back to the M&A integration decision in the mid-to-late stage through increasing knowledge similarity and narrowing network position difference. The higher the improvement of mid-to-late integration degree, the more it can drive mid-to-late industrial technology innovation through mid-to-late knowledge network reconfiguration. Research limitations/implications - Future research can accurately classify overseas M&A integration stages through case tracking and explore other network attributes. Practical implications - Practical guidelines are provided for managers on how to implement a multistage overseas M&A integration strategy, optimize knowledge network reconfiguration and promote industrial technology innovation. Significant practical implications are presented, especially in academia, society and quality of life.

The authors investigate how the digital innovation process unfolds in practice. Design/methodology/approach The authors undertake an exploratory and phenomenological study of 21 Malaysian small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the information and communication technology (ICT) sector. Findings The findings show that the delineation between digital innovation process and outcome is blurred in practice, due to the process' iterative nature. Under this process, customers' role has changed from being passive receivers of innovative products to active reviewers, testers, influential decision-makers, initiators and co-creators at different review points in the innovation process. Enterprises' role has expanded from being the initiator of the innovation process to being a cogitative actor by seeking and absorbing knowledge from customer reviews into the digital innovation process. Market analysis is often the initiator of the digital innovation process, and the findings shed light on the underlying causative mechanisms of the initiation stage, which are understudied and not well understood in the existing literature. Originality/value The study contributes to academic knowledge by answering scholars' call for developing third-generation practice-based innovation models, which accounts for enterprises' context-specificities and internal and external environments, and for exploring the suitability of the need-solution fit approach for the digital innovation process. Such models have only been conceptually advocated in the literature.

In these environments, Triple Helix has been operationalized in different ways, spaces, and contexts where those agents are transforming their roles in the development and strengthening of national innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystems. As a consequence, the phenomenon of entrepreneurial innovations emerged from enterprises with an entrepreneurial or high-growth orientation that collaborate with Triple Helix agents generating economic benefits and spillover effects. In emerging economies, the available literature about innovation and entrepreneurship is limited to explore the determinants of innovation performance as well as innovation constrains. Based on this argument and diverging from prior research, this research tries to provide a better understanding about the influence of Triple Helix agents on entrepreneurial innovations' performance of enterprises located in emerging economies. In particular, we analyze the effects produced by the links of enterprises with other enterprises, universities and government on their innovation performance (e.g., access to knowledge/technology, sources of funding, government subsidies), as well as, the moderation effects generated when those enterprises have a high-growth orientation (e.g., distinction of enterprises that develop entrepreneurial innovations or traditional innovations). To achieve this aim we look inside at the case of Mexico because is an emerging economy that during the last two decades has facing a transition to a knowledge-based economy. Using a cross-section dataset of 19,188 Mexican enterprises interviewed in the period of 2006 to 2012, we tested our proposed conceptual model with a Tobit regression. Our study provides interesting implications for the main actors involved in the Mexican Science, Technology and Innovation System, as well as, contributes about the debate of the impact of enterprises-university-government linkages on entrepreneurial innovations from diverse perspectives and research fields (e.g., open innovation, knowledge transfer, high-growth entrepreneurship, academic entrepreneurship, public entrepreneurship).

Design/methodology/approach - All hypotheses have been empirically tested by using structural equation model to analyze the quantitative data from a questionnaire survey covering 73 CFPTs in China. Findings - Results indicate that knowledge leadership positively moderates the relationship between cognitive conflict and CFPT innovation. This moderating effect is directly or indirectly revealed by the dual mediating roles of task-related information/knowledge elaboration and affective conflict, which are two processes manifesting whether cognitive conflict can or cannot be incorporated into team innovation. Research limitations/implications - Despite the external validity of results limited by convenient sampling method, the findings offer implications for promoting CFPT innovation. This can be achieved by developing competent knowledge leadership into team sensegiver, dissent reconciler and facilitator to accentuate benefits of cognitive conflict in information/knowledge elaboration and attenuate the likelihood of escalating to affective conflict. Originality/value - This study advances the understanding of why cognitive conflict has an equivocal effect on team innovation in the context of CFPT by originally revealing how leaders' role in information/knowledge management acts as a contingency and suggesting the dual mediating mechanisms that reflect the contingent impact.

These efforts revealed a significant need to prepare youth to gain a fundamental understanding of how intelligence is created, applied, and its potential to perpetuate bias and unfairness. This study contributes to the growing interest in K-12 AI education by examining student learning of modelling real-world text data. Four students from an Advanced Placement computer science classroom at a public high school participated in this study. Our qualitative analysis reveals that the students developed nuanced and in-depth understandings of how text classification models-a type of AI application-are trained. Specifically, we found that in modelling texts, students: (1) drew on their social experiences and cultural knowledge to create predictive features, (2) engineered predictive features to address model errors, (3) described model learning patterns from training data and (4) reasoned about noisy features when comparing models. This study contributes to an initial understanding of student learning of modelling unstructured data and offers implications for scaffolding in-depth reasoning about model decision making. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Scholarly attention has turned to examining Artificial Intelligence (AI) literacy in K-12 to help students understand the working mechanism of AI technologies and critically evaluate automated decisions made by computer models. While efforts have been made to engage students in understanding AI through building machine learning models with data, few of them go in-depth into teaching and learning of feature engineering, a critical concept in modelling data. There is a need for research to examine students' data modelling processes, particularly in the little-researched realm of unstructured data. What this paper adds Results show that students developed nuanced understandings of models learning patterns in data for automated decision making. Results demonstrate that students drew on prior experience and knowledge in creating features from unstructured data in the learning task of building text classification models. Students needed support in performing feature engineering practices, reasoning about noisy features and exploring features in rich social contexts that the data set is situated in. Implications for practice and/or policy It is important for schools to provide hands-on model building experiences for students to understand and evaluate automated decisions from AI technologies. Students should be empowered to draw on their cultural and social backgrounds as they create models and evaluate data sources. To extend this work, educators should consider opportunities to integrate AI learning in other disciplinary subjects (ie, outside of computer science classes).",2022,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bjet.13253,C14,1,2020,Article,0,0.085325963,0.18362847,0,0,0.089838278,0,0.09416668,0.0415135,0,0,0,0.079546996,0,0.119578137,0,0,0,0.145017728,0,0.075804639,0.07311139,0.009415803,0,0.034349654,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.132241074,0,0,0.213379897,0.158185466,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.042978933,0.089680186,0.162336687,0,0.149089098,0,0,0.071519652,0.070741384,0.191604682,0.050984603,0,0.079092733,0,0,0,0,0,0.085501647,0.092977387,0,0,0,0.032069031,0.035046325,0,0.092102635,0,0,0.078867055,0.397786967,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.031698302,0.047511,0.085325963,0,0.417871353,0,0.093687346,0,0.150578245,0.279279817,0.417560428,0,0,0,0.141097184,0.064038119,,,,,,,,,,1,1,42

The outcomes of these cycles are analysed including customisation of ecodesign tools and related application, and views of different stakeholders of the challenge for the transition. Findings This paper describes an action research application aiming at faster learning loops in the field of sustainable innovation management. As a second contribution, an Ecodesign Transition Framework (ETF) is proposed, combining both technical and soft sides. The proposed framework is structured in three levels (strategic, tactical and operational), with two complementary perspectives of a mature ecodesign pattern and a transition pathway. Practical implications The action research led to the intended outcomes both on the applied side, with increased diffusion of ecodesign in the company, and on the research side, with the ETF formulation and application. Practitioners interested in sustainable innovation can follow the ETF procedures, challenges faced, lessons learnt and conclusions. Originality/value The Insider Action Research addressed the literature gap to better relate the recommendations in the field to business reality. The resulting ETF brings a novel perspective for integrating environmental considerations in the product innovation process of a company. It organises the soft issues to be considered for the necessary transition towards such integration, consolidating and advancing previous theoretical views of ecodesign, with associated new practical implications.",2021,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJMPB-02-2020-0043,C10,1,2021,Journal,0,0,0.197248634,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.128447533,0,0,0,0,0,0.162854501,0.157068473,0.060685173,0,0,0.16847012,0.168950853,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.142049711,0,0,0.196462967,0,0,0,0.178370622,0,0,0.164232617,0.132569792,0,0.092333566,0.09633198,0.348755175,0,0,0.15970241,0,0.307297744,0,0,0,0,0.16991846,0,0,0.161944951,0,0,0.091843508,0,0.317635267,0,0,0.068895335,0.112937385,0,0.197868217,0,0.172871696,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.085426517,0,0,0.204140017,0,0,0,0,0.05031818,0,0,0.119997868,0.112132971,0.291048951,0.155345816,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,1,1,42

This study aims to address the ambidextrous innovation (radical and incremental) associated with firm performance on the SMEs and investigate the moderating effect of environmental factors on the relationship between technological innovation and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach The authors formulate a path model with the variables to investigate the impacts of the two different innovation strategies and their joint effects on firm performance. Meanwhile, they hypothesized that external environmental factors - market dynamism, labour availability, business cost and competitive hostility - moderate the association of radical and incremental innovations with firm performance. The validity of the proposed model was evaluated using a structural equation modelling approach. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to evaluate the convergent validity of the constructs. Findings The authors find that positive association between radical innovation and firm performance; it shows that the radical innovation strategies are positively related to firm performance in SMEs. They also find that the relationship between radical innovation and firm performance has moderated by environmental factors. Second, they find that the incremental innovation strategies have a negative impact to firm performance, and the relationship between incremental innovation and firm performance has no moderated by environmental factors. Practical implications This paper suggests that the managers of SMEs must involve in technological innovation, and offer fourth main implications above. In particular, the authors forewarn SMEs' managers of the necessity of generating that the relationship between radical innovation and firm performance has moderated by environmental factors, there are approaches fourth items around.

Technological innovation has been repeatedly used as a means differentiation in order to achieve a higher enterprise competitiveness. This has led to achievement of great scientific and technical progress. Nevertheless, in the last few decades, this has not prevented some territories from social issues such as poverty, exclusion, inequality, deterioration of environmental conditions and unemployment, among others. All these problems have a high local impact, being here where social innovation importance as a force for potential change is growing. Despite the broad consensus regarding the potential and the positive effects that social innovation has in those territories, there is still considerable debate surrounding how this concept should be defined and what factors contribute to its appearance. There are many variables that have been mentioned in the literature; however, a review of previous works shows that it is an open field for the identification of new ones. As described above, this paper has three main aims: to analyze the state of the art up to now, to give a definition of social innovation and to identify, analyze and weigh those key factors for its emergence in the territories. To this end we have designed a methodology based on a series of qualitative analysis techniques. Firstly, a review of the state of the art has been carried out to obtain a first approximation to the concept of social innovation and determine which elements are decisive in its appearance. Secondly, based on the existing literature and knowing what the problem is, we complete the methodology by designing and conducting semi-structured interviews. We chose this technique because we understand that social innovation is a living and constantly evolving phenomenon. This makes it very useful and allows us to confront the ideas and evidence from our literature review in a pragmatic way. The information gathered from the interviews allow us to identify, in a reliable and empirical way, new key elements to define social innovation. Additionally, the interviews help us to recognize and weigh the existence of new essential factors for the development of social innovation. These interviews have been conducted with a total of 24 agents involved in social innovation processes: managers and directors of centers responsible for promoting social innovation; agents that developed socially innovative initiatives; and scientists and academics who published work in this field. To analyze the content of the 24 interviews, we used the Atlas. ti computer program. This tool helped us analyze the transcripts. In order to explore and interpret the texts we analyzed 24 primary archives, which represent one transcript for each interview carried out. Afterwards, we encoded them. This process is a form of data reduction, since, based on a large volume of information, we managed to segment certain pieces of information (quotes) and label them based on codes. These are the main elements of analysis and they are considered as a system of categories. In our case, each time we have identified a quote, which made reference to the existence of a factor that conditioned the irruption of social innovation or that enunciated characteristics that defined it, we labeled a code-referred to a certain factor related to the content of the quotes-. Once the individual coding and data editing was completed, we organized the codes into families. Specifically, in line with the main purposes of our analysis, in two families: one to collect the codes related to the definition of social innovation and a second to gather those related to its determinant factors. To provide our study with greater depth, it was essential to carry out a statistical analysis of the content that would allow us to know the frequency of appearance of the codes. First, we calculated the absolute frequency of the codes, referred to the number of times a quote was identified with the same code. Nevertheless, to obtain more information about the importance of each one of the codes, we relativized them considering that they had previously been divided into families. Thus, we have obtained the relative frequency by families, which is, the number of times any code is repeated within a family according to the total number of times codes included in that family appear. This contributes directly to know which factors have more strength in the emergence of social innovation, among the ones pointed out by the interviewers. After the performance of the aforementioned analysis, we suggest the following definition of social innovation: Practices or initiatives carried out by the community that, based on the products, services or models they generate, or through the process designed to achieve their objectives, they reach solutions that give a better response, in an alternative and creative way, to social problems or needs. In addition, we point out five key points for the development of social innovation: social and cultural elements; political and institutional support; knowledge and facilitating mechanisms; spatial components and entities; and mechanisms that determine the corporate and social productive structure. These gather 29 factors identified and weighted according to the number of times they were indicated by the interviewees. Therefore, this work, not only points out the key factors of social innovation and the foundations on which they are grouped by theme, but also shows the importance of each underlying determinant according to its absolute and relative frequencies. These frequencies are used as a proxy to weigh the importance of these factors and foundations. This allows to know which ones are more needed and have more weight in the emergence of social innovations. The ten factors with more impact are: the socioeconomic level of the population (0.09532), the existence of strategies and lines of action to develop social innovation (0.08838), the existence of laboratories or centers of social innovation (0.05892), the existence of public funding (0.05892), the existence of social concern (0.05719), the cultural propensity to change (0.05719), knowledge of the local reality (0.05545), knowledge of the opportunities and potential of new means and instruments (0.04506), links encouraging public-private relations (0.04332) and the existence of cooperatives (0.03986). In summary, it should be noted that the recognition of these factors, together with the weighing of their relative importance, represents a considerable innovation with respect to the existing texts. This work has allowed us to verify the suitability of some determining factors that had previously been pointed out in other studies, state new ones that emerged after the investigation, explain the correlation between them and present how important and what role each of them plays to have a beneficial ecosystem for social innovation. This knowledge can be very useful when establishing lines and criteria for the design of prioritization strategies, useful where there are restrictions of a political, organizational or budgetary nature.

To do so, we perform a critical discourse analysis of popular and trade press websites. Promoters of precision agriculture champion how big data analytics, automated equipment, and decision-support software will optimize yields in the face of narrow margins and public concern about farming's environmental impacts. At its core, however, the idea of farmers leveraging digital infrastructure in their operations is not new, as agronomic research in this vein has existed for over 30 years. Contemporary discourse in precision ag tends to favour emerging digital technologies themselves over their embeddedness in longstanding precision management approaches. Following several strands of science and technology studies (STS) research, we explore what rhetorical emphasis on technical innovation achieves, and argue that this discourse of novelty is a reinvention of precision agriculture in the context of the growing smart agricultural economy. We overview six tensions that remain unresolved in this promotional rhetoric, concerning the definitions, history, goals, adoption, uses, and impacts of precision agriculture. We then synthesize these in a discussion of the extent to which digital tools are believed to displace farmer decision-making and whether digital agriculture addresses the biophysical heterogeneity of farm landscapes or land itself has become an experimental technology-a way to advance the general development of artificial intelligence. This discussion ultimately helps us name a larger dilemma: that the smart agricultural economy is perhaps less about supporting land and its stewards than promising future tech and profits.",2021,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10460-021-10244-8,C5,5,2021,Journal,0,0,0.083528146,0,0,0,0,0,0.037766972,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.080732652,0,0,0.034264166,0,0,0,0.07154499,0,0,0,0.127665627,0,0,0,0,0,0.083790519,0.09706135,0,0,0.139880002,0.075533945,0,0.063314189,0.069546976,0,0,0,0.081586691,0.073843029,0,0.067817022,0.067628586,0,0.780781405,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.068578227,0,0.45485048,0.038892629,0,0,0,0,0,0.0637669,0,0,0,0,0,0.060314554,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.028837581,0,0,0,0.152063651,0,0,0,0.045662933,0,0,0.184874128,0,0,0,0,,,,1,,,1,,,1,1,4

From a methodological point of view, the authors base the empirical investigation on a sample of Italian public universities and applied structural equation modeling to test the mediation and a group comparison to disentangle the effect of universities' digitalization. Findings The authors find a significant and positive effect of RC on performance.

The book explores all aspects of strategic leadership within a digital context. It investigates the interactions from both the firm/organization strategy perspective, including cross-functional actors/stakeholders who are operating within the organization and the various characteristics of operating in a cyber-secure ecosystem. As consumption and reliance by business on the use of vast amounts of data in operations increase, demand for more data governance to minimize the issues of bias, trust, privacy and security may be necessary. The role of management is changing dramatically, with the challenges of Industry 4.0 and the digital revolution. With this intelligence explosion, the influence of artificial intelligence technology and the key themes of machine learning, big data, and digital twin are evolving and creating the need for cyber-physical management professionals.

This study offers a research model that is derived from a fundamental premise of Service-Dominant Logic (SDL)concept and supported by Consumer Culture Theory (CCT). Design/methodology/approach ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Quantitative approach was applied through self-administered survey using purposive sampling method. The research model and hypothesis was analyzed by using Structural Equation Modeling. Findings-Educating among members in the small business community shows significant influences to dynamic interaction and value co-creation. Enriching negatively influences value co-creation. Dynamic interaction did not influence value co-creation, but dynamic interaction and value co-creation drives innovation process significantly. Practical implication ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Small business should educate each other to develop positive connectivity with other members to exchange and integrate collective resources. This situation could be beneficial to build synergy that drives innovation process as a survival and development strategy in challenging business environment. Originality/value ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The previous study on value co-creation is dominantly performed in established companies using qualitative approach. This research offers a new perspective from small business community in emerging market by applying quantitative approach. This article gives contribution to the collaboration of service-dominant logic and consumer culture theory. The research model will be beneficial to developan alternative marketing and business model as well as to drive the growth and the contribution of micro, small, and medium entreprises on society, environment, and economy.

Design/methodology/approach: The perspectives of 47 key informants, predominantly representatives of public and private Uruguayan institutions, including chambers of commerce and producer associations, were gathered through unstructured, face-to-face interviews. Findings: Aligned with the KBTF, the significance of tacit knowledge, complemented with explicit knowledge, was revealed, particularly in the more traditional industries. Indeed, industry-based (tacit) knowledge evolving for generations has been strengthened by innovative practices, enhancing the appeal and image of key commodities and the nationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s exports. Additional elements highlighted in the KBTF, such as problem-solving, knowledge integration and application and knowledge specialisation, were identified. Originality/value: Essentially, the study highlights the different associations between the KBTF, the various forms of acquiring knowledge (tacit, explicit), innovation and resulting impacts on food quality and increased product recognition for a developing economy. Moreover, the findings, which illustrate that crucial improvements can be achieved through knowledge-based approaches, could also be considered in the context of other emerging economies that are aiming to attain further socioeconomic development through maximising the benefits of knowledge. In addition, the study addresses a theme that has been sporadically presented in the academic literature, especially when studying developing economies and their industries.

For hypothesis testing, three models were used: The first, a multiple regression equation showing that 79% of scientific knowledge was the effect of statistically significant strategic and social learning knowledge; the second corroborated the previous one by means of route analysis and robust indicators with absolute adjustment RMR average 0.079, average incremental adjustment 0.983 for GFI, AGFI, NFI and parsimony 0.859; the third, ratifying the previous ones, using the simple Hayes mediational model, which determined a standardized indirect effect of 0.4289, statistically significant and defined by limits (ranges of 0.3419 and 0.5147), with a total effect of 0.7915, statistically significant and computed using 10 000 bootstrap. The results showed that strategic and social learning have a direct effect on scientific knowledge. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2022, University of Cienfuegos, Carlos Rafael Rodriguez.

However, who are the users? This simple yet crucial question has often been neglected. This paper argues that in order for a digital innovation for financial inclusion to generate expected outcomes, we need to examine whether the users are the intended users. This paper explores this issue by examining one particular instance - M-Shwari - the mobile-based digital savings service, which is intended to bank the unbanked, low-income population in rural areas in Kenya. In contrast to the expectation, the findings show that M-Shwari is likely to be used by high-income households in urban areas, who are already banked. This paper contributes to the emerging digital innovation and financial inclusion literature by calling for further research toward users in this particular context.

As any type of organization scales up, the issue in relation to, how to construct an effective knowledge sharing mechanism in KMS to covert individual knowledge into collective knowledge remains under surveyed. The rising concerns especially focus on the identification of individual knowledge worker, how firms facilitate knowledge sharing and the effectiveness of national knowledge management system. Communities of Practice (CoPs) are well known as effective mechanism to foster knowledge sharing theoretically and practically. This paper aims to explore the journey of CoPs driven KMS from the lens of individuals, firms' business strategies to the perspectives of national interest. On individual level, knowledge nodes are explored in the context of knowledge flow, which often transcend organizational boundaries and are distinct and different than workflow models. Thus, a CoPs centered knowledge flow model in a multinational organization is developed, implemented, and analyzed. On firm level, this model is underpinned in a CoPs framework built around four expected firms' major business strategies including four dimensions and sixteen criteria as a comprehensive mechanism to intensify knowledge sharing effect. Finally, a conceptual model of KMS embedded national innovation system is also addressed. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2017 by IGI Global.

Design/methodology/approach: This study used a combination of in-depth interviews and large-scale surveys in 15 enterprises in the North, Central and South of Vietnam. In total, 455 valid questionnaires from employees of information technology, telecommunications and e-commerce enterprises have been used in this research to explore the impact of transformational leadership (TL), coworker support (CS) and organizational learning (OL) on employees' IB. The data collected were subjected to quantitative analysis, including Cronbach's alpha reliability test, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) for scales and hypotheses testing. Findings: The results show that there are positive relationships between TL, OL and employees' IB, in which OL has a stronger impact than TL. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of this paper are that other factors affecting the innovation behavior of employees in Vietnamese enterprises have not been fully explored, the rejection of the hypothesis about the relationship between CS and employeesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ IB needs to be considered with the moderating role of job characteristics and the use of convenient random sample selection, due to which its reliability may not be guaranteed. Practical implications: From the results of this study, the authors point out that managers in Vietnamese enterprises should develop TL to deliver more creativity in an organization and enhance the corporate learning-oriented environment. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the existing literature by focusing on factors affecting IB of enterprises employees in Vietnam, an emerging economy in the world.

This study aims to investigate the influence of BIM CSFs in the design phase in the RM process, exploring the mediating effect played by BIM knowledge, RM knowledge, and BIM maturity. The research design applies the partial least-squares structural equation modeling technique, and the variables were collected by a survey with a sample of 195 respondents from different countries. The results pointed out that earlier and accurate three-dimensional (3D) visualization of the design was the top-ranked recognized design factor in the use of BIM. The findings also indicated that BIM design CSFs have a positive impact on the RM process. Furthermore, there is a positive and significant indirect effect of BIM knowledge, RM knowledge, and BIM maturity through the path of BIM Design CSF on RM.

The consolidation of GVCs ruled by global lead firms and the recession of 2008-09 exacerbated the pressures on cluster actors that based their competitive advantage on local systems, spurring an increasing heterogeneity, both across and within clusters, that is still overlooked in the literature. Drawing on detailed studies of different industries and countries, Local Clusters in Global Value Chains shows the co-evolutionary trajectories of clusters and GVCs, and the role of firms and their strategies in organizing manufacturing and innovation activities in the context of ongoing technological shifts. The book explores the tension between place-based variables and global drivers of change, and the possibility for territories containing such clusters to prosper in the new global scenario. By adopting insights from the GVC framework and management studies, the book discusses how the internationalization strategies of firms create opportunities as well as constraints for adaptive upgrading in clusters. This book is of interest to both researchers and policy-makers who are interested in the dynamic sources of competitive advantage in the global economy.

While innovation capability is widely viewed as competitive advantage, extant literature has also recognized the existence of hurdles in the successful practice and implementation of innovation. In an uncertain and intensely competitive business environment, it is not uncommon for organizations to pass on innovation tasks to supply chain partners. OEMs often pass on innovation introduction activities to their suppliers. This research seeks to determine whether such ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œInnovation PressureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â is conducive to good supplier-OEM relationships and to also explore the nature of the above relationship. A research model consists of a construct representing overall supplier-OEM relationship, a set of five intermediate relationship constructs, and two initial variables, one representing price pressure and the other representing pressure to innovate are developed. After following a detailed scale development procedure, data were collected from suppliers in the automobile light vehicle industry and the aircraft industry. The use of structural equation analysis and the application of other confirmatory factor analytic techniques show differences in the impact of the two initial variables on the outcome variable. Innovation pressure has several more positive links with the intermediate variables as well as the dependent variable than price pressure has. This may be because OEM pressure to innovate is often viewed more favorably by members of the supply chain than is OEM pressure to lower prices. For both initial variables, the negative paths in the mediation process are not necessarily unsurmountable hurdles. Favorable managerial actions that influence the intermediate variables can offset the possible negative impact of OEM pressure viewed as being adversarial.

The capacity to engage in systems thinking is considered to be a cornerstone for advancing collaborative team innovation. Our exploration is focused on introducing systems thinking within the context of collaborative team innovation and describing the relationship between a systems thinking paradigm and the organizational, social, and cognitive processes involved in collaborative innovation. The study provides a set of systems thinking profiles and factors-based innovation that define the ranges of an individual's capacity to engage in systems thinking and innovation.

However, in practical pedagogical applications, specific educational models and implementations are highly dependent on exceptional teachers with innovative abilities, especially in the cultivation of implicit higher-order thinking of students still lacking a better landing point. In the context of the current era of rapid development of information technology, the educational changes caused by the new development of smart education mean that more attention should be paid to the level of thinking and operational skills of students. As a result, the Problem-Based Learning for Computational Thinking Development Model for Primary and Secondary Schools (CTPBL), which is interdisciplinary, contextual, innovative, experiential and humanistic in nature, has emerged. As a new educational model, CTPBL helps integrate the advantages of existing Project-Based Learning and STEAM Education, crack the dilemma of teachers' choice of the inherent educational model, and realize the cultivation of students' information literacy and the improvement of their comprehensive ability. However, it still needs to be further explored, such as its operation mechanism, technology carrier, and teachers' roles.

A questionnaire was distributed to the project personnel of Chinese contractors engaged in international projects, and 174 valid questionnaires were collected.

Farmers valued the same key elements in face-to-face exchanges (workshops and visits) as in online materials. These were the opportunity for visual observation, deeper understanding of the context in which a practice was being tried and details about what worked and what did not work.

This change needed the adaptation of students to uncertain scenarios and affected the online system's outcomes. For example, there were issues with the internet connection, students got distracted easily, and they tend to turn off cameras so often they are losing face-to-face contact, and teachers were unfamiliar with the technology due to their age. This research explores the effects of online learning based on both technology acceptance and success models within this context. We conducted an online survey in engineering students belonging to Chilean universities, using five variables: information quality, system quality, user satisfaction, behaviour intention, and actual use of e-learning. The study used the partial least squares path modelling technique to analyse the measurement and structural model. We conclude that the quality dimension had a more significant impact on user satisfaction. Also, this satisfaction is an indirect antecedent of the use of e-learning systems. These findings show the importance of the system's characteristics in the final acceptance of the e-learning system by Chilean university students in the context of a pandemic.

However, merely a few studies have investigated knowledge transfer from a community-based innovation perspective. This research unveils the explicit structure and dynamic characteristics of U-I communities and examines the relationship between community dynamics and university knowledge transfer. The results indicate that U-I innovation communities in China present single- and multicenter structures and are evolving from localizing to specializing. Using membership turnover as a means of measuring community dynamics, we discover that community dynamics significantly affect university knowledge transfer in a curvilinear manner. Moreover, this inverted U-shaped relationship is moderated by a university's within-community position. The results of the other variables show that geographical distance does not significantly affect community-based knowledge transfer, while knowledge diversity positively contributes towards knowledge transfer performance. Our findings advance the innovation community theory by mapping social network mechanisms into community generation, evolution, and knowledge transfer. Notable practical implications are provided for U-I innovation community stakeholders and practitioners who engage in knowledge commercialization and innovation.",2021,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.technovation.2021.102305,C10,4,2020,Journal,0,0,0.071627356,0,0,0,0,0,0.03238607,0.05672268,0.191072294,0,0,0,0.093286905,0,0.206426603,0.103566035,0,0,0,0.114073282,0.007345583,0,0.026797314,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.059303875,0,0,0,0.557246263,0,0.09715821,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.334769239,0,0,0,0,0,0.039774794,0,0.058807448,0,0,0,0,0.057671818,0,0,0,0.013670405,0,0.071852347,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.024728906,0.074129841,0,0.05327396,0,0.2836134,0.036544316,0,0.078314084,0,0.040719107,0,0,0.574886865,0,0,1,,,,1,,1,,,1,1,13

Exploratory innovation shows a mix of full and partial mediating effects in the relationships between IC dimensions (except human capital) and FP. In contrast, exploitative innovation plays no mediating role in linking IC with FP.

The survival rate of Chinese start-ups, however, shown by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) report, is below 5 percent. Furthermore, the annual failure rate is twice as high as that of GEM member countries. Therefore, it is essential to study individual choice of entrepreneurship or the mechanism influencing employment. Under these circumstances, this study can guide the entrepreneurial practice of new entrepreneurs in China and provide theoretical guidance for the improvement of China' s entrepreneurship policy. Based on previous literature, this paper proposes a theoretical framework for entrepreneurial MOSR (Motivation, Opportunity, Skill, and Risk), clarifies the key drivers for individual entrepreneurial decision making, and analyzes the four factors' internal mechanisms. Moreover, this study constructs a mathematical model of whether an individual starts a business and analyzes the mechanism generating decision-making behavior between employee-to-entrepreneur and entrepreneur-to-employee. This research uses the GEM database's Adult Population Survey (APS) to conduct empirical analysis and study the mechanism influencing individual, entrepreneurial decision-making behavior. From the perspective of behavioral economics, the first part constructs the MOSR theoretical framework of the individual entrepreneurship decision-making mechanism. This study proposes an entrepreneurial MOSR model based on the MOS model. We conclude that individuals will analyze positive utility obtained from entrepreneurial income, work autonomy, and entrepreneurial opportunities when choosing their career and weigh the disutility originating from entrepreneurial risk based on the expected utility theory. Ultimately, the decision to start a business is made according to the expected total utility of entrepreneurial behavior. This paper notes that there is no exaggeration in entrepreneurial ability serving as the source of power to germinate entrepreneurial motivation of behavior agents, given that it is key to entrepreneurs seeking opportunities, creating value, and realizing entrepreneurial rent. Meanwhile, entrepreneurship skills are the endogenous mechanisms of entrepreneurial decision-making behavior. That is, entrepreneurial skills affect perceptions of entrepreneurial opportunities and the acceptance of risks, and affect entrepreneurial income and job autonomy. Therefore, this paper reveals the internal mechanism between the four factors of skills, opportunity, risk, and capacity, and puts forward the theoretical framework of the entrepreneurial decision-making mechanism. The second part analyzes the generation mechanism of entrepreneurial decision behavior based on mathematical and simulation analyses. Early in their careers, it is likely that individuals choose to become employed due to their weak ability and lack of opportunities. Nevertheless, the behavior agent will trade off entrepreneurship's positive and negative utility with increased age and ability improvement over time. If the positive utility of increased income, autonomy, and opportunities exceeds the negative utility of entrepreneurial risk, the individual may choose entrepreneurship. There is another possibility: the behavior agent may choose entrepreneurship early on because of resource and opportunity endowment. However, as time passes and age increases, the degree of marginal utility in entrepreneurship gradually leads to a decrease in entrepreneurship's positive utility. Meanwhile, individuals seek employment instead of entrepreneurship. Given the common path from employment to entrepreneurship in real life and the goal of current ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ entrepreneurship and innovation ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ policy in China, this study further analyzes the behavioral characteristics of such entrepreneurs by simulation. It is estimated that individuals are encouraged to choose entrepreneurial behavior earlier; this is attributed to the positive utility generated by increased entrepreneurial income, caused by the accumulation of endogenous ability. This proves the entrepreneurial ability of the internal determining mechanism. The third part empirically analyzes the generation mechanism of entrepreneurial decision-making behavior and examines the MOSR model of the entrepreneurial decision-making mechanism. Considering different countries' heterogeneity, this study adopts the panel individual fixed-effect model for empirical testing. The baseline model's regression results validate the MOSR theoretical framework. Specifically, entrepreneurs choose behavior that has the capacity for high entrepreneurial ability, judging market trends accurately, capturing market opportunities, integrating resources efficiently, and avoiding and dissolving entrepreneurial risks reasonably. The regression results of the control variables reveal that individuals from non-innovation-driven countries show more entrepreneurial motivation. One explanation is that non-innovation-driven countries are equipped with more entrepreneurial opportunities as the economy develops. They encourage entrepreneurial behaviors and policies to reduce entrepreneurial risks to promote economic development. Perceiving more entrepreneurial opportunities, individuals consequently have higher entrepreneurial willingness. This study conducts a robustness test by substituting the explained variables, alternating the regression model, and adding interaction terms; it shows that entrepreneurial ability can enhance individuals' perceived opportunities and entrepreneurial intentions, contribute to their avoiding dissolved risks, and alleviate the negative impact of risk and fear on individual entrepreneurial behavior, thus further confirming the rationality of the research proposition. The fourth part discusses the research conclusions and enlightenment. Entrepreneurship is a process whereby entrepreneurs balance opportunities and resources to achieve their goals. Therefore, the behavioral agent should strengthen the accumulation of entrepreneurial ability, cultivate team leadership, finance and marketing ability, update and accumulate knowledge in an active manner, and enhance theoretical learning and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlearning by doing. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ They should also explore the correlation between market demand and entrepreneurial resources, intensify the construction of social networks, recognize and assess entrepreneurial risks reasonably, and take active actions to mitigate them. Compared with the first developed countries, China still lags behind in financial support, education training, research transfer, and business environment. First, the government should improve the guarantee and service of entrepreneurship and enhance individuals' motivation for entrepreneurship. Second, entrepreneurship education and incentives should be strengthened, and individuals' entrepreneurial skills improved. Third, it is strongly advocated that we should provide new entrepreneurs with reasonable entrepreneurial resource support, weaken their risk perception, so as to bear greater uncertainty. Finally, we call for implementing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œstreamlined administration and delegated powerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ establishment of an administrative power listing system, simplifying the business registration process, and reducing tax and administrative burden on new firms, thereby reducing entrepreneurs' costs of time and money.

Drawing from cognitive theories of creativity and reasoning, we posit the need for both informal controls that enhance creativity and formal controls that enhance reasoning in a balanced portfolio of project controls. Two case studies provide preliminary evidence that a well-balanced portfolio of controls can result in the effective design and implementation of novel product features.

Organizations are yet to test its utilization as an intangible strategic resource at a time when organizational strategic landscapes - rapidly changing in a globally networked digitally empowered world - require them to enhance capability of combining resources for meeting stakeholders' expectations. Design/methodology/approach Blockchain as an emerging technology draws frequent industry announcements and specialists' posts on daily basis in media, and there exist inadequacies with respect to the availability of relevant studies in the extant literature on the subject of blockchain, which itself is in infancy. Keeping in view the limitations associated with the traditional understandings of scholarship underscoring, thereby that research and knowledge discovery have been restricting the progress across disciplines on account of which knowledge domains fail to make a meaningful effect; research design of the paper comprises the scholarship of integration method, which might appear to be less systematic but was more emergent in comparison to a traditional methodology of systematic literature review, and suitable for conducting this study. Findings Findings of this study suggest that blockchain with huge popularity as a technological innovation has huge potentialities and promises to be a strategic intangible resource for organizations helpful in attaining sustained advantage. However, the findings also suggest several cautionary remarks. Research limitations/implications This paper offers exploratory remarks by discussing blockchain in the context of its consideration as a significant intangible strategic resource helpful in attaining sustained competitive advantage, emphasizing the need for continuous attention and revision with its increased applications. It attempts to assess the untapped potential of blockchain incorporating ample scholarly value in this era of fourth industrial revolution. The findings offer greater significance for different stakeholders including researchers and policymakers.

This study adopts a systematic literature review approach which results in arguing that this relationship is not explored in-depth in current literature. This is especially more critical for emerging economies as current literature shows a lack of empirical research in this research topic. A well-structured questionnaire was administrated for data collection. A total of 435 valid responses from top executives, managers, and experts were received and used for data analysis. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to investigate the relationships between constructs and latent variables. Our findings reveal that there is a significant and positive relationship among sustainability innovation and firm competitiveness. Firm competitiveness has a positive and significant relationship with financial, environmental, and operational performance. Moreover, sustainability innovation had an indirect positive and significant effect on financial performance. The statistical results indicate that the indirect effects are all significant (sig. < 0.05) and the order of these indirect effects is consistent with those of direct effects of firm competitiveness on firm performance dimensions. Stakeholder theory is applied to check how firm competitiveness helps improve the performance of SMEs. To the best of our knowledge this study is the first that explores the mediating role of firm competitiveness between sustainability innovation and SMEs' performance. Based on the context of the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, this study presents implications for entrepreneurs and top management with respect to strategic perspectives to drive their businesses in a sustainable direction.

It is largely unknown how agricultural knowledge providing organisations, such as advisors and science organisations, understand and respond to digital agriculture. The concept of 'organisational identity' is used to describe both initial understandings of, and emerging responses, to digital agriculture, which together show how organisations 'digi-grasp', i.e. make sense of and enact digitalisation in their organisations. The understanding is described using aspects of identity change (i.e. the nature, pace, source and context of digital agriculture), while the responses are outlined through the various attributes of organisational identity (i.e. capabilities, practices, services, clients, partners, purpose and values). We explore this question in the context of New Zealand through 29 semi-structured interviews with different types of agricultural knowledge providers, including farm advisors, science organisations, as well as technology providers. The findings show that digitalisation is often understood as farm-centric, despite being considered disruptive both on- and off-farm. These understandings influence an organisation's digitalisation responses to digital agriculture. The responses were often ad-hoc, starting with adapting organisational capabilities, practices and services as their clients and partners require, rather than a strategic approach allowing for more flexibility of roles and processes and changing business models. The ad-hoc approach appears to be a response to uncertainty as digital agriculture is in early stages of development. This indicates that agricultural knowledge and innovation system should better support agricultural knowledge providers in digi-grasping and developing a digitalisation strategy, by anticipating possible futures and reflecting on the consequences of these for value propositions, business models and organisational identities of agricultural knowledge providers.",2019,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.njas.2019.100313,C10,1,2019,Journal,0,0,0.135507176,0,0.173271971,0,0,0.138979111,0,0.10730998,0,0,0,0,0.176483478,0,0,0.065309968,0.107014684,0,0.111878866,0,0,0.112508754,0.050696111,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.20245115,0,0,0.113463215,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.063431926,0,0.718770436,0.087091414,0,0,0.092774333,0,0,0.188524211,0,0,0,0,0.166604755,0,0,0,0.063095263,0,0,0,0,0.047330174,0.051724316,0,0.135932821,0,0,0.116398638,0,0,0.075640848,0.123195967,0,0,0.067411593,0,0.210362196,0,0.100785569,0,0,0.034567917,0,0,0.082436932,0.231101559,0.09997337,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,47

One way to solve this challenge is to allocate resources to identifying and exploring new trends and opportunities emerging from the environment that may affect existing business models, and guide the development of new ones. As has been widely acknowledged, many incumbents fail at more radical business model innovation. Few studies have examined the role of cognition in this context. We suggest that differences in strategic issue identification and interpretation can help to explain the cognitive barriers that emerge when incumbent firms try to engage with radical business model innovation. We propose and test a Delphi-based method to elicit and examine differences in the perception of industry trends, comparing innovators, core business employees, and external experts, in the context of a leading Nordic insurance firm. We find considerable disagreement between members of the innovation department and the core business, in this firm. We suggest this helps explain why internal innovators find it challenging to sell radically new business models to the core business.

Moreover, this emerging servitization literature is limited to the traditional lead-firm perspective within larger consortiums. To help redress the balance, our research studied six collaborative servitization projects in mobile information and communication technologies (mICT) to explore why some open innovation efforts succeed in simultaneous service and product innovation with a market application of innovative solution, while others do not. The study provides empirical evidence that only a small number of projects resulted in an effective servitization innovation solution. This conclusion emphasises the complexity of creating service innovation in the mICT sector. By comparing better performing servitization projects with those that were less successful suggests that higher performance, in terms of novel service development, requires more than mere strong intention, adequate leadership and change management competencies.

First, the authors explored the importance of 4.0 technologies in data collection from crowds, subsequently examining how new technologies might drive forward the development of collaborative strategies with suppliers. Reductions in resource wasting were observed. The role of 4.0 technologies in increasing supply chain sustainability overall was the main focus of the study. Design/methodology/approach - This research builds on a single inductive case study method. The authors performed an in-depth analysis of data from an Italian agritech distributor. Data - aside from multiple semi-structured interviews - were collected via several different sources. The results have been summarized in an integrated holistic conceptual framework. Findings - The findings show that 4.0 technologies allow for swift information exchanges between consumers, the agritech business and suppliers. As a result, consumers might demand new products and, consequently, the agritech business can arrange new offerings with suppliers, completing the OI and shared value creation circle. Likewise, the possibility of adopting a just-in-time approach of sorts may reduce the wasting of resources. The absorptive capacities and knowledge management capabilities of the agritech business play a fundamental role in OI performance, sustainability and success. Originality/value - This research seminally explores how 4.0 technologies and knowledge management techniques can enable OI in agrifood businesses.

This study aims to identify whether BD and KM can be established in these emerging issues. We used a survey questionnaire to collect data from various firms and industries. We used structural equation modeling (SmartPLS and SPSS) to validate the research model with a sample of 155 companies in a developing country such as Indonesia. The result demonstrates a positive relationship between KEEC and BPI, followed by several significant findings such as BDAT with KEEC; KEEC on big data knowledge management (BDKM); BDKM and BPI; and BDAT on BDKM. In contrast, BDAT is nonsignificant for direct relationship on BPI, and interestingly, it becomes a significant result after mediated by BDKM. Similarly, BDKM has successfully mediated the relationship between KEEC and BPI. The management level ideally develops and increases such a knowledge creation/acquisition practices and BDAT in an organization to gain more meaningful benefits from these two capabilities. BDAT, KEEC, and BDKM simultaneously are a clear antecedent approach, which ultimately results in flexibility, effectiveness, and effectivity of BPI. The cases of this research are profit firms in a developing country such as Indonesia. A future study could be considered in different settings such as type of industries or more specific company's type, the economy level of countries (comparing between developed and developing countries), and environmental dynamical.

This research analyses how ERP and BMI are related and, in turn, what is the final the impact on organizational performance. Design/methodology/approach The sample consisted on 104 organizations from different industries, all of which used an ERP software. A structural equation model was used to test the six hypotheses. Findings The results indicate that the BMI constructs considered (i.e. value-generation and organizational complexity) mediate the impact of the ERP constructs (organizational adaptation and organizational resistance), in organizational performance. Successful ERP implementation is not an end itself for this companies, but merely a path and a process for improving the business model with the aim improving performance in the marketplace. Research limitations/implications This study offers a new outlook on how a company should leverage the ERP adaptation, and any resistance in the organization to innovating in the business model. This study is rooted in the evolutionary perspective of BMI, but it also integrates into an overall model other points of view such as the rational positioning view and cognitive view. Practical implications Organizations must understand the ERP flows in depth, each ERP flow is the work result of a multitude of companies over several years. All departments, and in particular the research and development department must participate actively in the ERP implementation. Organised complexity means opportunities for success in the market. Organizations must train their departments in ERP and not just teach them how the ERP works. ERP implementation needs consider improvements to the business model and ultimately the performance, but not separately. Originality/value BMI has received contributions from several domains such as entrepreneurship, management organization and strategic management among others. Nonetheless, the role of ERP in BMI is far from being understood and the few contributions focus only on technologyper se.

In addition, the study aims to explore the mediating role of green innovation in the impact of business analytics and environmental orientation on green competitive advantage. Design/methodology/approach Based upon the theoretical analysis of existing literature, several hypotheses have been developed. Data was gathered using a survey method. The survey was conducted using online portal, 388 valid responses have been processed using SPSS 23.0 and AMOS 23.0 for empirical analysis. Two steps were used, first reliability and validity have been measured. Following this, the authors employed structural equation modeling technique to test hypothetical relationships. Findings The results from the authors' empirical analysis indicate that business analytics and environmental orientation have a pivotal role toward green innovation as well as green competitive advantage. If the results are seen comparatively, then it can be indicated that the role of business analytics is more powerful compared with the environmental orientation. Although environmental orientation is a key factor of green innovation, but its direct role toward green competitive advantage is not so strong. Similarly, to check the other mechanisms, the role of green innovation as a mediator was explored. Empirical findings have established the mediating role of green innovation in the influence of business analytics and environmental orientation on green competitive advantage. Thus, the results confirm a mechanism of green innovation in the impact of business analytics and environmental orientation on green competitive advantage. Practical implications The study captures the attention of decision-makers and highlights that business leaders need to emphasize on business analytics while making managerial decisions related to green innovation and green competitive advantage. Originality/value For the first time, this study explored the role of business analytics and environmental orientation together toward green innovation and green competitive advantage. The study adds value to the existing literature and opens new avenues for scholarly research in the area of managerial decision-making.",2022,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/MD-01-2020-0065,C8,4,2022,Journal,0,0,0.117391061,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.626302028,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.092707764,0.226924505,0,0,0,0.194934652,0.043918488,0,0,0,0,0,0.089711098,0.120015465,0.187993269,0,0.084539832,0.097193937,0,0.058461739,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.057331263,0.311338583,0.075448059,0,0,0.080371223,0.182885972,0,0.163320186,0,0,0,0,0.072165584,0,0,0,0.109319965,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.109421431,0.235519602,0.062357324,0.205766615,0,0,0,0.065528334,0.053362876,0,0.050840958,0.058399257,0,0.121492417,0,0,0,0.185927163,0,0,0,0.214247523,0.066735106,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,47

This premise is indispensable for maintaining an optimal balance between incentivizing new innovation and providing public access to existing innovation. Despite its importance, the doctrine that performs this gatekeeping role nonobviousness has long remained indeterminate and vague. Judicial opinions have struggled to articulate both what makes an invention significant (or nonobvious) and how to measure nonobviousness in specific cases. These difficulties are due in large part to the existence of two clashing theoretical frameworks, cognitive and economic, that have vied for prominence in justifying nonobviousness. Neither framework, however, has generated doctrinal tests that can be easily and consistently applied. This Article draws on a novel approach network theory to answer both the conceptual question (what is a nonobvious invention?) and the measurement question (how do we determine nonobviousness in specific cases?). First, it shows that what is missing in current conceptual definitions of nonobviousness is an underlying theory of innovation. It then supplies this missing piece. Building upon insights from network science, we model innovation as a process of search and recombination of existing knowledge. Distant searches that combine disparate or weakly connected portions of social and information networks tend to produce high-impact, new ideas that open novel innovation trajectories. Distant searches also tend to be costly and risky. In contrast, local searches tend to result in incremental innovation that is more routine, less costly, and less risky. From a network theory perspective, then, the goal of nonobviousness should be to reward, and therefore to incentivize, those risky distant searches and recombinations that produce the most socially significant innovations. By emphasizing factors specific to the structure of innovation namely, the risks and costs of the search and recombination process a network approach complements and deepens current economic understandings of nonobviousness. Second, based on our network theory of innovation, we develop an empirical, algorithmic measure of patentability what we term a patent's network nonobviousness score (NNOS). We harness data from US patent records to calculate the distance between the technical knowledge areas recombined in any given invention (or patent), allowing us to assign each patent a specific NNOS. We propose a doctrinal framework that incorporates an invention's NNOS to nonobviousness determinations both at the examination phase and during patent litigation. Our use of network science to develop a legal algorithm is a methodological innovation in law, with implications for broader debates about computational law. We illustrate how differences in algorithm design can lead to different nonobviousness outcomes, and discuss how to mitigate the negative impact of black box algorithms.",2020,Journal,,C7,8,2018,Journal,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.049255862,0,0,0,0.119469551,0.365538001,0,0.120462305,0.007756995,0,0,0,0,0.077825496,0,0.053037624,0,0.077330059,0,0,0.108943796,0,0,0,0,0,0.063334296,0.239399657,0,0.286671397,0,0.050836627,0,0.177036072,0,0.133737381,0,0.061411828,0.551170709,0,0.117839671,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.145769184,0,0.035219292,0,0,0.072222331,0,0,0.057744233,0,0.075876657,0,0.066291225,0.064972827,0.10923591,0.05875866,0,0,0.065345461,0.032758564,0,0,0.039140855,0.07029385,0.056257731,0,0,0.038591092,0.067062891,0.124050456,0.046015663,0.042999706,0.055804368,0.416993949,0,0.1162397,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,47

However, little is known about SMEs' OI barriers, particularly in emerging economies. Drawing on both network and transaction cost theory, this study aims to explore the barriers to SMEs' OI adoption in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach The study adopted an exploratory sequential research design that involved both qualitative and quantitative study methodologies. A total of 644 responses (21 survey interviews and 623 usable questionnaires) across SMEs in Ghana were collected and analyzed in the study. A qualitative analysis involving quotations extracted from the respondent's statement was used to present the qualitative findings, whereas SEM-partial least square, co-variance approach, was used to analyze the formulated hypotheses. Findings Results show that significant barriers to SMEs OI adoption are collaboration barriers - difficulty in finding the right partners and problems of cooperation and coordination of operational functions; organizational barriers - lack of flexible internal procedures and structures and organizational inertia; and strategic barriers - opportunistic behavior of partners and lack of strategic and resource fit. Contrary to existing findings, financial and knowledge barriers were disclosed as driving factors, rather than barriers, to SMEs' OI adoption; these findings challenge conventional thinking about SMEs' major OI barriers.

Design/methodology/approach Questionnaire-based survey was used to collect data from top executives and senior managers of exporting companies in Ghana. Data obtained were analysed using the structural equation modelling. Findings The findings revealed that social capital of SMEs exert the greatest influence on their export performance. Innovation and marketing capabilities are also key drivers of export performance among SMEs as they fully mediate the social capital-export performance relationship. Notwithstanding, marketing capabilities appear to exert a greater influence than innovation capabilities on the export performance of SMEs. Research limitations/implications - The study used perceptual measures of international performance by managers of SMEs in the Ghanaian exporting sector making it difficult to determine respondent bias. Practical implications - Managers of exporting firms should build stronger relationships with their customers and suppliers who contribute significantly to their export performance. SMEs would also have to hone their innovation and marketing skills as strategic components in enhancing their export performance. Social implications - Market-based resources such as marketing and innovation should not be taken for granted by SMEs in the export business. Originality/value The study offers some lessons on how small firms can sharpen their marketing and innovation capabilities to derive export performance benefits from social capital.

This paper also examines the adoption of OI within a firm's practices and models, and within the three dimensions of firm sustainability. Design/methodology/approach - Survey data from 48 specialized SMEs manufacturing supercars were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. SmartPLS software was used to conduct a path analysis and test the proposed framework. Findings - The findings suggest that high adoption of OI models tends to increase firm innovativeness. Similarly, the adoption of OI practices has a positive effect on innovativeness but to a lesser extent than OI models. The moderation results of innovativeness further show that OI models and practices can benefit the performance of SMEs. Specifically, two dimensions of performance - environmental and social performance - were found to be greatly influenced by OI. Research limitations/implications - Due to parsimony in the investigated model, this study only focuses on OI adoption as practices and models without considering its drivers or other contingency factors. Practical implications - This paper could help practitioners in SMEs better understand the benefits of adopting OI to be more innovative but also more sustainable.

There are big differences in how this is done. Approaches depend on motivations and capacities of leadership. Leadership concerns itself with organizational improvement. In more precise terms, leadership concentrates on establishing widely agreed, valued and worthwhile directions (both strategic and tactical) for organization and implementation of what is required to stimulate, motivate, guide and support people to move in those directions. A generic definition of impactful and effective leadership concerns direction and influence. If stability is the goal of what is called management, improvement is the goal of leadership. Any reform creating innovative schools to meet 21st century challenges is difficult unless leaders share its aims and are prepared to make it work. Successful leadership plays a significant role in improving school reform and learning. Social change requires leadership that encapsulates vision as well as achievable practice. Leadership can effectively be investigated at intermediate levels, as it is conceptualized and developed within key frameworks: (1) Networks of educational centers, (2) Administrative coordination networks, (3) Professional bodies and associations, (4) Policy bodies. We explore such leadership, how it is productively distributed across the school system and what stimulates and sustains its development. There is strong focus on the forms of leadership most likely to foster learning and how such successful forms of leadership contribute to school reform and innovation. We describe those successful leadership practices, as well as their relationship to the school organization and to enhanced learning outcomes. Comparative analysis looks at examples in Catalonia and the United States. The research focus is on the need for new models of school organization to provide students with life skills required in the emerging knowledge society.

Design/methodology/approach Based on a case study of a new practice called 11X integration strategy in Guangzhou Pharmaceutical Holdings Limited, a Chinese pharmaceutical group in Guangdong province, through applying Grounded Theory the authors get a concise systematic framework of generation process that is more practical and more understandable than the counterparts in current literature. Findings First, this paper uncovers five stages and two parallel sub processes in the generation process of IDMI. The sub processes involves practical exploration process (i.e. primary activities) carried out by the internal change agents and theoretical support process (i.e. support activities) carried out by the external change agents. Second, by adopting a process perspective the authors are able to demonstrate how the different activities in both types of processes are combined over time in an intertwined way. Research limitations/implications First, the case the authors studied is embedded in the context of China's transitional economy, and the single case study limits us to make comparisons of the generation process of management innovation between different market economies. Second, the external-driven management innovation is still a field untouched. Third, in the research the authors explore the issues of how new management innovation is generated and implemented, but the authors do not systematically research on why different companies exhibit different levels of management innovativeness. Practical implications First, the findings suggest that firms should consciously and systematically invest in IDMI to create sustainable competitive advantage. Second, the process framework provides a clear guidance to the managers in Chinese state-owned enterprises who are engaged in developing or adopting management innovation. Third, the study indicates the managers in Chinese company should be aware of the importance of external change agents to IDMI. Fourth, this study could facilitate the enterprises to develop or adopt management innovation based on their real needs rather than just jumping on the bandwagon when adopting certain new management skills. Originality/value This study offers a new generation framework by identifying possible facilitators of IDMI that does not yet exist in extant literatures, and the two sub processes - the practical exploration process and the theoretical support process - deepen the understanding of the generation mechanisms of IDMI. Furthermore, the study contributes to reaching a better understanding of management innovation in the context of transitional economy such as China.",2018,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JOCM-03-2017-0078,C9,1,2022,Journal,0,0.191781125,0.275152475,0,0.087958832,0,0,0,0.031102318,0,0,0,0.059597383,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.056793573,0,0.007054411,0.171339979,0.025735095,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04953815,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.677836557,0,0,0.0694399,0,0,0.304060565,0.044210607,0,0,0.047095453,0,0.053000133,0.047850698,0,0,0.059257045,0.076396322,0.084574323,0,0,0,0,0.069659564,0.055385764,0,0,0.04805286,0.039385572,0.064118122,0.069004191,0.292318202,0.180860853,0,0,0.160309926,0.038397905,0.062538524,0,0.029791483,0.068440902,0.071246029,0.213574221,0,0,0,0,0.087739339,0.060988724,0.075209791,0,0.117315127,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,47

Through a longitudinal, exploratory qualitative case study of a large firm, this article investigates how organizational members respond to an ambidextrous organizing model designed to accelerate digital innovations. The firm relied on a hybrid model of separation and integration to organize and manage its digital transformation efforts. This study unfolds the implications and consequences of such a model at the micro-level. By applying a paradox lens, it shows how the coping actions of organizational members affected the digital transformation. The article illustrates how the hybrid organizing model led to the emergence of three paradoxes at the organizational level (paradoxes of organizing, attention, and knowledge sharing) that organizational members had to cope with. It shows how organizational members, through their coping with these paradoxes, indirectly affected the organizing model by altering its original design; and how the management, influenced by these learnings, subsequently adapted the model to enable a better sustainability over time. Overall, the findings show and explain why organizing for digital transformation is a particularly complex and paradoxical endeavor. They also provide important insights to managers and organizational developers, helping them to become aware of possible tensions in their organizing efforts as well as of coping strategies and practices to tackle these tensions.

We test the effects of small-world network in the context of nanotechnology patenting in China. Empirical results reveal that small-worldness, or the co-existence of high clustering and low path length in the network, displays inverse U-shape relationships with future patent output of the individual inventors and the system. Interestingly, the inflection point of the nonlinear relationship is significantly higher at the individual level.

Most research considers digital innovation as the final result of adopting digital technologies, such as new products, processes, services, or business models. In other words, this research advances the concept of digital innovation as an outcome. In parallel to this research on digital innovation as an outcome, the concept of digital innovation as a process has emerged, linking innovation capabilities, organizational structures, boundaries, and technology management in organisations. The scattered existing research on digital innovation as a process explores the anatomy of the digital transformation of the innovation process by focusing on its phases, underlying mechanisms, barriers, and enabling factors. We argue that management research should pay more attention to this perspective on digital innovation.

We find that individual irrationality and network density are the most influential factors. Moderate degree of irrationality results in moderate knowledge unity and superior quality of knowledge; increasing network connections or decreasing average path length (APL) can promote quality of knowledge integration and knowledge unity. Furthermore, APL is more influential than clustering coefficient and centralization (CE). Less clustering may contribute to higher quality of knowledge integration, while higher CE may contribute to higher knowledge unity.

This paper uses panel data of state-owned listed enterprises from 2008 to 2019 to explore mixed-ownership reform's influence on the green transformation of SOEs and its specific mechanisms. The results show that the diversity of mixed shareholders, the depth of mixed equity, and the restriction of mixed equity significantly promote the SOEs' green innovation. Moreover, there are distinctions in the impact of the shareholding ratio of heterogeneous shareholders on green innovation. Only the increase in the shareholding ratio of foreign shareholders has a positive correlation with green innovation. The mechanism tests indicate that the mixed-ownership reform plays a governance role in the green transformation of SOEs by optimizing the reasonable allocation of environmental protection subsidies and propelling environmental social responsibility's active performance. Our study further subdivides the significant promotion effect of mixed-ownership reform on green innovation, finding that it only exists in the SOEs in heavily polluting industries and regions with a high degree of marketization.

Drawing sociotechnical perspective of ETHICS theory, the study develops and conceptualize information technologies/systems (IT/IS) proactive capability and socialization-codification knowledge process that produce business transformation process in digital-based era. Design/methodology/approach Of the 173 company-enterprise respondents in Indonesia, the authors empirically test and validate the conceptual model using structural equation model tool-SmartPLS and SPSS statistical. The enterprise respondents were manufactures industry, construction services, hardware and software, plantation and agriculture, financial and insurance services, and other retail trade. Findings The authors found different findings of mediating effect and direct relationship effect. Socialization knowledge process has directly influence IT/IS proactive capability and enterprise digital business transformation. Codification knowledge process has successfully support IT/IS proactive capability, but unsupported correlation on enterprise digital business transformation. Also, IT/IS proactive capability positively influence enterprise digital business transformation. Enterprise business process suffers when the firm transform their business process into digital-based only using codification knowledge practices because documented knowledge (codification type) is not strong enough to help company in the way of enterprise digital business transformation. Mediating role show IT/IS proactive capability is crucial approach for enterprise business transformation to maximize codification knowledge practices. The findings present one fully supported results of mediation role through IT/IS proactive capability. A stronger support for enterprise IT/IS strategy in company, a high opportunity for codification knowledge practices to improve the digital ways to transform the enterprise business process. In short, the results can guide enterprise managers on how to manage their knowledge resources and maximizing emerging technologies to achieve enterprise digital business transformation.

Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative research strategy incorporating an open-ended questionnaire was used to collect data from 15 senior B2B marketing managers in three Korean companies that deployed the customer-centred approach. The grounded theory technique (Strauss and Corbin, 1998) and the mind map method (Burgess-Allen and Owen-Smith, 2010) were used to show how senior Korean marketing managers' thoughts are processed and knowledge transfer occurs. Findings - The findings show that a governance mechanism is instrumental in guiding interactive communication that results in knowledge being used that benefits the members of a partnership arrangement. The knowledge development process is enhanced by mutual trust and emotional bonds that are established through socialization. Cyclical interaction through socialization and frequent (in)formal meetings facilitates the process of turning explicit knowledge into tacit knowledge and vice versa, and encourages new knowledge to be developed.

Based on six cases of frugal enterprise, this study contributes to the FE literature in particular and FI more generally. We reveal the various resources that frugal entrepreneurs mobilize and how they mobilize them in three broad categories, namely, human, social and financial. Unlike other entrepreneurs, frugal entrepreneurs usually possess manual work skills, and they help each other with their technical, financial and other knowhow. They understand their context and culture and consider them deeply when developing frugal solutions. Indeed, frugal entrepreneurs integrate the culture and context into their innovation process, because they themselves are embedded in the same society.

Following the steadily growing interest in business model innovation, software tools have shown great potential in supporting business model development and innovation. Yet, understanding the cognitive processes involved in the generation of business model ideas is an aspect of software design-knowledge that has so far been neglected. To investigate whether providing stimuli - in this case, brainstorming questions - can enhance individual creativity in this context, we conduct an exploratory experiment with over 100 participants. Our study is the first to systematically investigate the process of idea generation using a software-based business model development tool with stimuli.

More recent research has shifted the focus from organizational level exploration and exploitation to the individual in order to understand psychological micro-foundations of individual ambidexterity. However, our current knowledge on how knowledge flows within individual ambidexterity are initiated and affect performance outcomes is limited. This study thus strives to shed light on the topic by introducing two mechanisms, namely ambidextrous knowledge seeking and ambidextrous knowledge offering, that capture how knowledge flows within individual ambidexterity are initiated. Based on survey-data from 415 employees, findings from structural equation modeling provide first empirical evidence that the focal constructs significantly affect knowledge accumulation on the department level as well as its performance. Finally, results from additional moderation analysis indicate, that ambidextrous knowledge offering leads to higher performance effects in environments characterized by the pursuit of radical innovations, while ambidextrous knowledge seeking is rather suited for environments with a focus on innovating incrementally.

Local communities have been living with and developing water-responsive infrastructures for generations that engage and support the complex ecosystems they inhabit. Many of these innovations improve coastal resiliency, yet remain undocumented and unexplored in the evolution of contemporary solutions. Rooted in traditional ecological knowledge, or TEK, these technologies work symbiotically with, rather than against nature, and offer examples of a more comprehensive approach to underwater and intertidal design. These innovations are LoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ÂTEK, a term coined by designer and author Julia Watson, that is defined as resilient infrastructures developed by indigenous people through Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) (Watson 2019). The movement to bring these innovations to the forefront of the design field counters the idea that LoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ÂTEK indigenous innovation is low-tech, a term often incorrectly applied to indigenous innovation that means unsophisticated, uncomplicated, and primitive. In actuality, LoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ÂTEK aligns to todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sustainable values of low-energy, low-impact and low-cost, while producing complex nature-based innovations that are inherently sustainable. Lo-TEK expands the definition of contemporary technology by rebuilding our understanding of climate resilient design using indigenous knowledge and practices that are sustainable, adaptable, and borne out of necessity. Indigenous people have learned to live symbiotically with their environments, especially water. This essay will explore the Kuttanad Kayalnilam Farming System by the Malayalis in India, the Sangjiyutang Mulberry Dyke and Fish Ponds in China, and the Ramli Lagoon farms in Ghar El Melh, Tunisia. These innovations are inherently resilient to the stresses of the climate and are multi-functional, symbiotic structures themselves. While not directly intended for protection from the new challenge of sea level rise, they can inform how we can build circular water systems that work with the environment, rather than disrupting it.

Findings show that knowledge sharing, and inter-departmental connectedness contribute to develop both exploratory and exploitative innovation as well as enhance firmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s operational performance. Moreover, exploratory and exploitative innovation influences a firmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s operational performance. Finally, environmental competitiveness negatively affects the relationship of knowledge sharing and inter-departmental connectedness with operational performance. The findings emphasize the flexible and informal social relations among people in creating effective exploratory and exploitative innovation and enhancing firmsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ operational performance. It suggests that knowledge sharing, and inter-departmental connectedness as an informal and flexible coordination mechanism are more important in predicting operational performance if the level of environmental competitiveness is low.

Drawing on the concepts of organisational agility and absorptive capacity with transaction cost theory, this studyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s goal is to investigate factors affecting the adoption of an Open Innovation (OI) orientation in Thai SMEs. Using data from 214 SMEs in Thailand, structural equation modelling validated the model and analysed the proposed hypotheses. The results show that organisational agility, economic and financial readiness and absorptive capacity relate positively to OI adoption and innovation performance. Organisational agility (b = 0.553) had the greatest influence on OI adoption, then economic and financial readiness (b = 0.405) and absorptive capacity (b = 0.387) followed. The results of mediation analysis also reveal that OI adoption partially mediates the effects of organisational agility and absorptive capacity on innovation performance. Our study provides a trailblazing empirical analysis of the major factors influencing SMEsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ OI adoption and performance, extending knowledge of OI adoption by SMEs in emerging economies.

This paper examines the value of alliance portfolio diversity and whether R&D human capital is the pathway through which alliance portfolio diversity influences innovation novelty. We reason that the absorptive capacity of R&D human capital determines a firm's potential gains from highly diverse alliance portfolios. Using data from the Spanish Technological Innovation Panel (PITEC) for the period 2005ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2012, results support the curvilinear (inverted U-shaped) association between alliance portfolio diversity and firm innovation performance reported in studies, suggesting that not only too little, but also too much alliance portfolio diversity may be detrimental to firm innovation performance. Findings emphasise the value of alliance portfolio diversity in high-technology industries to achieve explorative performance objectives, given the technological complexity, market uncertainty and the divergent skill sets required for breakthrough innovations in these sectors. Further, we find evidence that R&D human capital plays an important role in innovation novelty by partially mediating the relationship between alliance partner diversity and firm innovation performance, emphasising the importance of internal capabilities to harness external knowledge assets. This study provides valuable insights to managers aiming to increase the effectiveness of their alliance portfolios.

Design/methodology/approach: In total, 213 valid questionnaires from SMEsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ top management positions were evaluated to investigate the proposed model of the research empirically. As a methodological approach, partial least square (PLS) path modeling approach, a variance-based structural equation modeling was employed. Findings: The statistical results imply that explorative learning has a positive impact on improvisational creativity and innovation while improvisational creativity has a positive influence on compositional creativity and innovation as well. Compositional creativity and innovation are also positively associated. Surprisingly, improvisational creativity mediates the relationship between explorative learning and innovation. Furthermore, PLS-multi group analysis reveals that heterogeneity exists in the collected data and number of employees is a moderating variable. The results of the research indicate that companies with number of employees between 51 and 100 are more creative and innovative in comparison with other groups. On the other hand, the positive relationship between explorative learning and compositional creativity was not supported in this research. Originality/value: This study is one of the few research works in the realm of examining the structural relationship among explorative learning strategy, improvisational creativity, compositional creativity, and innovation in ICT-SMEs, regarding the number of employees as a moderating variable.

Taking into account the importance and universality of the applications of such innovation, scholars have explored the factors affecting the use of exploitative innovation from multiple perspectives, two being organizational atmosphere and organizational structure. However, most of the existing literature on exploitative innovation evaluates the independent impact of each perspective on the utilization of such innovation, ignoring the joint effect of the two together. This study believes that a comprehensive examination of the combined effect of organizational atmosphere and organizational structure on the utilization of exploitative innovation would bear great theoretical and practical significance for the subject. First, organizational atmosphere is a ""soft"" element that can constrain members and play a role in social environments, while organizational structure is a ""hard"" element that plays a role in more contextual environments. Therefore, within organizations, organizational atmosphere and organizational structure are two important factors that can each independently constrain the behavior of members, but can also act in combination. Second, the interactive perspective of organizational innovation believes that innovation is a complex product of the interaction between the particular body (individual, team, or division) of an organization and the specific situation. Among them, situations can be divided into two categories, according to certain characteristics: situations that can exert social influence, such as group norms spontaneously formed in the social interaction of organizational members, and more contextual situations that act as background environments.Organizations must arrange various elements, such that they work in tandem to drive innovation.Organizational atmosphere, as a ""soft"" element that constrains members, can construct a social environment that affects innovation, while organizational structure, as a ""hard"" element, constructs a more contextual environment that creates a similar effect. According to the interactive perspective of organizational innovation, organizational atmosphere and organizational structure should be perceived as working cooperatively to drive innovation. Working with the interactive perspective of organizational innovation and territorial theory, this paper explores the influence of the territorial organizational atmosphere on the utilization of exploitative innovation in enterprises and identifies the intermediary mechanisms and boundary conditions for its proper function, thereby defining not only the atmosphere, but also an organizational model (control-oriented HRM system), and an integrated model of each departmental entity (inter-functional coordination). In this paper, the methods of hierarchical regression analysis and process analysis are applied, and 2113 members of 146 companies are used to build a representative sample of multi-source data. The study found that the territorial organizational atmosphere, as a ""soft"" element that constrains the behavior of organizational members, will reduce inter-functional coordination and is not conducive to the realization of exploitative innovation. Further, the control-oriented HRM system, as a structural element of the organization, can be considered a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â factor in terms of behavioral constraint. It can indirectly buffer the negative effects of the territorial climate, by exploiting technological innovation via adjusting the relationship between inter-functional coordination and utilization of such innovation. This paper contributes to a body of research on organizational innovation, territoriality, and HRM systems. First, in comparison to previous studies, the impact of organizational atmosphere and organizational structure on organizational innovation is evaluated from a different perspective. This paper integrates and examines the joint role of organizational atmosphere and organizational structure on exploitative innovation, based on the interactive perspective of organizational innovation. In addition, it explores the theory of territoriality as an emerging perspective. From this perspective, the antecedent variables affecting exploitative innovation contribute to the literature on organizational innovation. Second, this paper proposes that a territorial climate exists within the organization, such that its members will engage in territorial behavior that influences the organizationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s exploitative innovation, and further examines the intermediary mechanisms and boundary conditions for its proper function, thus enriching the theory of territoriality. Third, this paper explores the ""soft"" elements of organizational atmosphere, and how they interact with the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â elements of the HRM system to influence organizational innovation. The results show that the control-oriented HRM system plays an important role in buffering the negative effects of territorial climate on exploitative innovation. Therefore, the conclusions of this paper have deepened researchersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ understanding of the HRM system.

Today, a successful company should be, lean, modular, and with a smart approach to new products development. In this context, the source of competitive advantage cannot be found into a static heterogeneity of resources, but companies must be able to create and manage a dynamic competitive process to continuously reinvent their products/services and to re-combine their resources with their partners' ones. A paradigm for this behavior is the Open Innovation one, as created by Chesbrough. According to the rules of this paradigm, companies have to acknowledge that they operate in a network of relationships, they must be open to cooperate with their external partners, and they must not try to limit their actions in reaching only for some pre-defined result. So, Open Innovation Networks appear to be similar to those described by the scholars in the Complex Adaptive Systems field where the actions of the system, and of its parts, are the result of the various actors' interactions in an emergent way. In this paper, we use a Systematic Literature Review approach to explore how the main topics in the System Thinking Perspective, and in particular, those related to Complex Systems, are linked to the Open Innovation studies.

However, building a strong green brand to foster consumers' satisfaction is often challenging for firms. Drawing on the dynamic capability and mechanism-enabling perspectives of ambidexterity. The purpose of this research is to explore mechanisms of perceived brand performance and green trust through which green brand ambidexterity acts as a facilitator of consumer satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach The hypothesized relationships were tested by both partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM; symmetric approach) and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA; asymmetric approach) with data collected from a green consumer questionnaire survey in Hong Kong. Findings The results from PLS-SEM indicate that green brand ambidexterity affects consumer satisfaction through multiple mediating paths of perceived brand performance, green trust-consumer and the sequential integration of perceived brand performance and green trust. Results from fsQCA further reinforced these findings. Research limitations/implications The present research provides a nuanced understanding of how ambidexterity enhances consumer satisfaction in the context of a green brand by identifying multiple mechanisms. Originality/value There is a lack of research on how green brand ambidexterity affects green brand outcomes from the perspective of value creation for consumers. The present research fills this gap by providing more comprehensive explanations of mechanisms for green brand ambidexterity to facilitate consumer satisfaction.

Separate streams of literature analyzed the relationship between strategy and the role of management accountants in firms; and the relationship between the role of management accountants and new product innovation. Drawing on this evidence, I hypothesize that the relationship between differentiation strategy and exploratory innovation is mediated by two factors: a greater business partner orientation of management accountants and their subsequent use of the management accounting systems for attention focusing and decision making purposes. I find empirical support for the proposed three-path mediated effect using a structural equation model with survey data from 244 firms from German-speaking countries. In total, these findings reveal that management accounting department can be part of the strategy implementation mechanism in firms that emphasize exploratory innovation.

It explores the role of two moderators for this cost-efficiency advantage to emerge, namely, eco-innovativeness (investments dedicated to the adequate implementation of circular practices in current production processes) and green jobs (human resources dedicated to circular practices). Using data on 13,117 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) from the Flash Eurobarometer 2017, a cluster analysis revealed that there is a gradual path towards Circular Economy among European SMEs, with the implementation of increasingly more circular practices. Four ordered probit models confirmed that a higher level of circularity in processes achieved by European SMEs is related to a reduction in their production costs. Moreover, eco-innovativeness positively moderates this relation. In contrast, the relative share of green jobs in SMEs' workforce mitigates the impact of circularity on production costs. In practice, by engaging in circularity, SMEs can contribute to the United Nations goals for Sustainable Development while reducing production costs; although the level of this reduction depends on how circularity is implemented.",2022,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bse.2949,C14,3,2020,Journal,0,0.46724136,0.335180577,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.132351823,0,0.138367665,0,0.017186846,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.138756391,0,0.027820459,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.169178241,0.156900544,0.409237417,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.116579904,0,0,0,0,0,0.412784625,0,0,0.0780339,0,0,0,0,0.058536218,0.063970731,0.156212655,0.168116711,0.089022808,0,0,0.1210147,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.042752328,0,0,0.203909928,0.095272635,0,0,0,0.257547403,0,,,,,1,1,1,,,1,1,22

Design/methodology/approach: Based on the database of ChinaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s private market and data set of news clouds, the statistic approach is applied to explore and explain whether equity investment promotes knowledge-driven BMI. Machine learning method is also used to prove and predict the performance of such open innovation. Findings: The results of logistic regression show that explanatory variables are significant, providing evidence that knowledge management (KM) promotes BMI through equity investment. By further using back propagation neural network, the classification learning algorithm estimates the possibility of BMI, which can be regarded as a score to quantify the performance of knowledge-driven BMI Research limitations/implications: The quality of secondhand big data is not very ideal, and future empirical studies should use first-hand survey data. Practical implications: This study provides new insights into the link between KM and BMI by highlighting the important roles of external investments in open modes. Social implications: From the perspective of investment, the findings of this study suggest the importance for stakeholders to share knowledge and strategies for entrepreneurs to manage innovation. Originality/value: The concepts and indicators related to business models are difficult to quantify currently, while this study provides feasible and practical methods to estimate knowledge-driven BMI with secondhand data from the primary market. The mechanism of knowledge and innovation bridged by the experience from investors is introduced and analyzed.

As the world is increasingly populated by IoT devices and sensors that can sense their surroundings and communicate with each other, a digital environment has been created with vast volumes of volatile and diverse data. Traditional AI and machine learning techniques designed for deterministic situations are not suitable for such environments. With a large number of parameters required by each device in this digital environment, it is desirable that the AI is able to be adaptive and self-build (i.e. self-structure, self-configure, self-learn), rather than be structurally and parameter-wise pre-defined. This study explores the benefits of self-building AI and machine learning with unsupervised learning for empowering big data analytics for smart city environments. By using the growing self-organizing map, a new suite of self-building AI is proposed. The self-building AI overcomes the limitations of traditional AI and enables data processing in dynamic smart city environments. With cloud computing platforms, the self-building AI can integrate the data analytics applications that currently work in silos. The new paradigm of the self-building AI and its value are demonstrated using the IoT, video surveillance, and action recognition applications.

The top management team (TMT) is expected to set the course for digital innovation, which is a challenging endeavour given the novel and cross-functional nature of digital innovation. We draw on role theory to make sense of emerging role requirements for the TMT and combine this view with upper echelon theory to hypothesize on the specific TMT characteristics that are needed for digital innovation. We first theorize that firms could benefit from TMT digital knowledge. Second, we argue that the effective utilization of TMT digital knowledge can be fostered at internal TMT interfaces, such as between the chief executive officer (CEO), respectively a chief digital officer (CDO), and other top managers. Finally, we consider the TMT hierarchical structure as a contextual factor in the stimulation of TMT integration processes by integrative CEOs and CDOs. We employ panel data regressions to a longitudinal dataset of US industrial firms and find a positive relation between TMT digital knowledge and digital innovation, on average. We additionally find evidence for the integrative roles of CEOs and CDOs. However, our findings also indicate that the CDO's integrating role can be hampered by a strong hierarchical structure in the TMT.

Previous studies have not examined the temporary group context when conducting research on creativity. Drawing on the social cognitive theory and the actor-partner interdependence model (APIM) approach, this study explored two questions related to how psychological cognitive factors (i.e., intrinsic motivation and creative self-efficacy) motivate creativity, and whether the motivation process is influenced by others. Using a class experiment and a pre and posttest questionnaire survey completed by civil engineering students that performed an idea generation task, this study applies an APIM approach to distinguish the positive actor effects of students' innovation motivation and task motivation on their own creativity, instead of the negative or nonsignificant influences from a partner. Creative self-efficacy-as a mediator-plays an indirect positive actor role between students' intrinsic motivation and their own creativity, but an indirect negative partner role in affecting partners' creativity. The findings contribute to an in-depth understanding of the componential model of creativity, including the creative source of intrinsic motivation and the motivational path from interest to belief.

The authors also investigate the relationship between performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and OLR of students. Moreover, this work examines the mediate role of learner satisfaction in the linking of OLS usage and performance in Vietnamese higher education. Design/methodology/approach A total of 558 valid questionnaires were collected from students at five large universities in Vietnam to test the fit of proposed model, measurement model and structural relationships between constructs by using partial least squares (PLS) path analytics. Findings Performance expectancy, effort expectancy and social influence have significant positive effects on OLR of students in online learning context. OLR has a positive impact on both learner satisfaction and OLS usage. The learner performance is significantly influenced by satisfaction while it is indirectly affected by OLS usage via satisfaction. In addition, OLS usage plays as a partial mediation variable in the relationship between OLR and satisfaction. The path model could explain 56% of variance of the learner performance. Research limitations/implications This study has a few limitations. First, this study is cross-sectional, which allows the elaboration of correlations between variables but lacks confidence in causality exploration. Second, the self-reported data are inherently subjective, which might generate biased results in measuring learner performance. Practical implications This research has implications for instructors and higher education organizations. The findings provide insights for instructors to manage efficiently the OLS adoption of students. Higher education organizations should understand and identify factors in terms of OLR, OLS usage, learner satisfaction and learner performance when OLSs are implemented in university. Performance expectancy, effort expectancy and social influence have been criticized for considering OLR.

From a long-term perspective, however, it is still not clear how social innovation contributes towards filling institutional voids. This paper aims to understand which institutional factors have influenced social innovation and how a coffee production initiative has transformed the reality in which it operates. We analysed a joint initiative of social enterprises that coordinate an organic coffee value chain in southern Mexico, a region in which extreme poverty affects 75% of the population. The case study involved thirteen semi-structured interviews with key actors and participant observation in situ, complemented by secondary data, in an interpretative perspective that adopted a qualitative and exploratory approach. The main results indicate that social innovation fills institutional voids by creating a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“self-revolving system of activity expansionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. This system helps to scale social innovation based on the collaboration of different actors and the integration of the coffee production chain that promotes the social and economic development of the community by: (1) establishing a more productive relationship between small local producers; (2) adding value to the coffee; (3) encouraging social and economic empowerment in the cooperative; and (4) organizing local economic activities.

A wide range of emerging technologies such as blockchain, internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), robotics and many others have changed the way in which firm value chain activities or processes were executed traditionally. The mining industry has also witnessed the introduction of these emerging technologies in various processes from the exploration stage to the final processing of ores. The purpose of this paper is to understand the pace of adoption of emerging technologies in the Indian mining industry and identify the challenges that managers confront while adopting emerging technologies. Design/methodology/approach: The authors undertook qualitative research. Data collection was done in two stages. Secondary research was conducted to arrive at a repository of use cases of the adoption of emerging technologies in the global mining industry. Primary data collection was also done. The insights on emerging technology adoption and challenges faced in the Indian mining industry were captured by in-depth interviewing of subject matter experts. The authors interviewed 21 mining subject matter experts with a semi-structured open-ended questionnaire. The responses were content analyzed by thematic content analysis. Technological-organizational-environmental (TOE) and diffusion of innovation (DOI) frameworks were applied to segregate different factors affecting the adoption of emerging technologies in the Indian mining industry. Findings: Emerging technologies such as blockchain, IoT, AI, ML, robotics has been applied across various mining engineering value chain activities such as in drilling, blasting, excavation and ore hauling. However, emerging technologies adoption was hindered because of a lack of managerial awareness, cultural inertia, substantive upfront investments and the nature of intangible benefits in the short run. Research limitations/implications: The research applied technology adoption frameworks in the mining industry. The authors used TOE and DOI frameworks to understand the challenges faced by Indian mining firms. The research findings, thus added to the conversation of TOE and DOI frameworks in the context of the Indian mining industry. Practical implications: The research finding would help mining firm managers to anticipate the challenges with respect to technology adoption. This would allow mining executives to create a proper technology adoption plan and intervene proactively. The research would also provide information about the steps taken by competing firms with respect to emerging technologies adoption. The research would help managers to decide technology implementation steps in drilling, blasting, excavation and ore hauling to be undertaken for successful adoption of emerging technologies. Technology firms could gain insights into the issues faced by mining firms in adopting emerging technologies. This research would help managers to influence organizational technology policy and endorse the addition of pro-technology policies in mining activities. Policymakers involved in the mining sector could also incorporate industry-level policy decisions so as to facilitate the adoption of emerging technologies among mining firms and remove the barriers to the adoption of emerging technologies. This would create an opportunity for technology providers to redesign product offerings, which could be a good fit for Indian mining firms. Originality/value: Indian mining industry contributed significantly to the Indian economy. Despite this, limited focus has been put regarding the adoption of emerging technologies in the mining industry. Mining managers did not have any framework to understand the challenges faced in the adoption of technologies across the mining value chain that is in drilling, blasting, excavation and ore hauling. This study focused on identifying those challenges through the use of technology adoption frameworks. This research was one of the first studies to gain insights on emerging technologies adoption in the context of the mining industry through the theoretical lens of TOE and DOI frameworks.

(1) The expression of scientific articles: Towards atomization. With the development of reading style, discipline development, academic communications and emerging technology, the phenomenon of fragmentation in the process of scientific research and publishing has become increasingly prominent, which forces the author's writing style and article form to change. The future article is likely to be atomized articles with propositions and insights, which can be ideas, data and observations, or opinions. The content tends to be short and concise; in reading, it is more in line with the needs of human fragmented knowledge acquisition, but also conducive to machine identification, discovery, sharing and replication; and more diversified in presentation. (2) The conception of scientific articles: Providing better insights. AI constantly adapts to the more and more complex environment, improves the generalization ability of AI, and efficiently obtains hidden causality from structured data, which is not affected by physiological and psychological state, provides reliable and error-free analysis ability, and innovates the analysis method and efficiency of data. At the same time, AI has more powerful storage capacity and faster computing power, runs stably, helps researchers to improve the processing and analysis of data, provides researchers with more profound insights and support, and at the same time makes opinions more predictable and standardized, and enhances human decision-making ability. (3) The creation of scientific articles: The coexistence of UGC/PGC/OGC/MGC mode. MGC creation is the direction of intellectual media, and it will also be the mainstream form of articles creation in the future. With the help of machine intelligence, researchers can produce professional content more efficiently and realize the evolution road of intelligence specialization and intelligence of all things. Of course, the development of the Internet era is not a new model rapidly replacing another model, this change is usually relatively gradual, sudden far-reaching and fundamental changes are even less, so the future scientific articles creation is still the era of the coexistence of UGC/PGC/OGC/MGC mode. (4) The presentation of scientific articles: Giving readers the greatest freedom to read. In terms of the development of the whole society, interactivity is an important direction of today's technological development, and ""Taobao waiter"" is the best illustration. For interactive articles, readers can change the underlying code and generate modified charts in order to better understand, verify or reconstruct the relevant work, and give readers more freedom to read; MR/VR/AR gives readers a more three-dimensional reading experience; articles have increasingly become web content, and hyperlinks have become a new way of literature citation. We can not only link the literature, but also link the comments of the ""cited"" references, and judge the starting point, breadth and depth of the articles according to the authority of the linked commentators. The innovative expression of scientific articles brings changes to the form of scientific research, academic innovation and discipline ecology, which makes full communication and interaction among researchers; the deep integration of emerging technologies and scientific journals will have a great impact on the development of science.

More specifically, this study investigates the relationship between productivity and customer satisfaction and its effect on a firm's performance. In addition, this study investigates the roles of productivity and customer satisfaction in the structural relationships among variables. Design/methodology/approach A theoretical model was proposed among innovation, productivity, customer satisfaction and firm performance. A sample of 127 firms from data sets of the American Customer Satisfaction Index and COMPUSTAT was collected. To test the hypotheses, this study used ordinal least squares analysis and path analysis. Findings The findings of this study verified that a positive relationship exists between productivity and customer satisfaction and that service productivity and customer satisfaction are positively associated with a firm's performance. In addition, customer satisfaction was found to fully mediate the relationship between productivity and a firm's performance. Research limitations/implications This study only focused on a short period for each variable due to the difficulty of matching all the data sets used for measuring each variable, which limited the observation of the different effects of service productivity among industries. Practical implications The findings of this study suggest that managers can improve productivity without sacrificing customer satisfaction. In addition, services firms should consider innovation, productivity and customer satisfaction in a holistic way because all of these affect a firm's performance.

Partial least squares structural equation modeling is applied to the domain of cybersecurity by collecting data on users' attitude towards digital security, and analyzing how that influences their adoption and usage of technological security controls. Bayesian-network modeling is then applied to integrate the behavioral variables with simulated sensory data and/or logs from a web browsing session and other empirical data gathered to support personalized adaptive cybersecurity decision-making. Results from the empirical study show that predictive analytics is feasible in the context of behavioral cybersecurity, and can aid in the generation of useful heuristics for the design and development of adaptive cybersecurity mechanisms. Predictive analytics can also aid in encoding digital security behavioral knowledge that can support the adaptation and/or automation of operations in the domain of cybersecurity.

While boundary resources that are owned by opensource communities and small-scale software vendors are also critical components in the digital infrastructure, their role in digital innovation has yet to be systematically explored. In particular, software libraries are popular boundary resources that provide functionality without the need for continued interaction with their owners. They are used extensively by commercial vendors to enable customization of their software products, by communities to disseminate open-source software, and by big-tech platform owners to provide functionality that does not involve control. This article reports on the deployment of such software libraries in the web and mobile (Android) contexts by 107 start-up companies in London. Our findings show that libraries owned by big-tech companies, product vendors, and communities coexist; that the deployment of big-tech libraries is unaffected by the scale of the deploying start-up; and that context evolution paths are consequential for library deployment.

These technological transformations have the ability to deepen, enrich, and adaptively guide learning and interaction, but they also hold potential risks for neglecting people's affective learning processes-that is, learners' emotional experiences and expressions in learning. We argue that technologies and their usage in particular should be designed with the goal of enhancing learning and interaction that acknowledges both fundamental aspects of learning: cognitive and affective. In our empirical research, we have explored the possibility of using various types of emerging digital tools as individual and group support for cognitively effortful and affectively meaningful learning. We present four case studies of experiments dealing with social networking systems, programming with computer games, and makers culture and digital fabrication as examples of digital education. All these experiments investigate novel ways of technological integration in learning by focusing on their affective potential. In the first study, a social networking system was used in a higher education context for providing a forum for online learning. The second study demonstrates a Minecraft experiment as game-based learning in primary school education.

Specifically, this study suggests that business ties enable and political ties inhibit organizational unlearning (i.e. regenerative dynamic capability), which may, in turn, affect exploratory (i.e. renewing dynamic capability) and exploitative (i.e. incremental dynamic capability) innovation behaviors of the firm. Thus, the purpose of this study is to offer a theoretical framework in which organizational unlearning and learning act as mediating mechanisms between business and political ties and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach Structural equation modeling and mediation analyzes were used on a sample of 302 small and medium-size enterprises in Turkey. Findings This study found that business ties enable organizational unlearning while political ties impede it. This study further demonstrates that business ties positively and political ties negatively relate to organizational learning through organizational unlearning. In addition, this study shows that political ties are mostly negatively and indirectly related to firm performance through organizational learning while business ties positively and indirectly relate to firm performance. Practical implications The findings demonstrate the critical role that personal networks play in organizational learning and firm performance. This study provides evidence to the need to recognize and evaluate the potential and undesirable impacts of political ties on cultivating innovation skills and firm performance. In addition, this study recommends managers to embrace the significance of organizational unlearning in strategic renewal, particularly as it applies to building renewing and incremental dynamic skills for enhanced firm performance.

Meanwhile, organizational learning has long been considered as one of the measures of organizational performance. This article investigated the impact of enterprise social networking systems (ESNS) usage on knowledge management processes and organizational learning; in particular, we examined the mediating role of knowledge creation and knowledge sharing. Four theories from sociology and strategic management were used to build the hypotheses in the research model. An online survey was conducted to empirically test the model. Our study results showed that ESNS usage directly and indirectly influences organizational learning; and that knowledge management processes (knowledge creation and sharing) mediate the path between the two. This study contributes to the existing literature on enterprise social media for three reasons. First, it is among the first to connect the three independent concepts (social media, knowledge management, and organizational learning) and explore their relationships in one theoretical framework. Second, this work also specifically examines the influence of ESNS (Yammer in this case) on organizational processes and outcomes. Third, this is a pioneering study that employs multiple theories to address the research questions under the organizational social media context.

Business Model Innovation (BMI) leads to irreversible fundamental changes in key components of a company's business model, which means it carries with it a high level of risk, ambiguity and uncertainty. Drawing on the data from a cross-industry sample of 563 European SMEs, we apply structural equation modelling to examine how a firm's performance is affected by innovating its business model. A conceptual model is developed to examine how organisational capabilities and implementation of a profit- or growth-oriented strategy, as materialised in BMI, affect a firm's overall performance. The results indicate that, while the direct link between BMI and firm performance is not significant, this path is fully mediated through efficiency growth, organisational capabilities and revenue growth. Furthermore, there are significant direct effects from efficiency growth, organisational capabilities and revenue growth on firm performance.

Our ambition is exploratory in attempting to take stock of heterogeneous contributions across the spectrum of social science. The articles have been reviewed with a focus on six themes, derived from current discussions in economic geography and transition studies: skills, technology, physical resources, markets, institutions and policies. Four major implications emerge from the review. First, green growth requires competences that allow for handling complex, non-routine situations - in both the private and the public sector. Second, technological progress should be directed towards greener technologies, to avoid investments funds being channelled to brown technologies for short-term returns. Third, our knowledge of the opportunities for achieving green growth must base upon a joint assessment of market failures, structural system failures and transformational system failures.

Secondly, the paper provides insights into the network portfolio composition, which has been underexplored in IE literature, allowing for the identification of those relationships considered more fruitful to enhance innovation processes from a local perspective. To capture both aspects of IE's relational dimension (i.e. network structure and network portfolio of relationships) our paper adopts an explorative approach, by taking evidence from the empirical study of the biopharma IE in greater Boston area, which has been exemplified as a successful case. Our empirical study combines two methods, namely social network analysis and expert interviews. Firstly, we conduct a social network analysis to gain insights about the optimal network structure and secondly, we conduct a round of semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders in the ecosystem to explore the characteristics of the desirable network portfolio.

Providing toilets has often not been a sustainable solution because of failure to link them to the necessary service infrastructure. Resolving urban sanitation problems in low-income countries requires innovations in approaches covering infrastructure, technology, social embedding, financial mechanisms and cost recovery. This paper explores the potential challenges and contribution of NGOs in facilitating new, integrated solutions to urban sanitation problems that address the entire sanitation chain, promising better social, financial and environmental sustainability. A case study of a sanitation project initiated by a large Dutch NGO is presented, using reconstruction of project documentation and interviews with project stakeholders. The analytical framework combines elements from Transition Management (TM) with insights from process approaches to development projects and community development. The choice of the TM concept is motivated by the notion that the new NGO approaches could be conceived as efforts to initiate a sustainability transition process in urban sanitation, whereas its complementation with insights from the development studies domain answers to the need to attune a TM-based framework to participation in the socio-institutional context in low-income countries, to understand the progress of governing transition processes in informal, low-income settings. This context requires special attention for capacity-building and creation of organizational structures in poor local communities. The case study shows that this entailed specialised groundwork, with which the NGO laid a crucial foundation that enabled transition frontrunners to act. Simultaneously, this focus on bottom-up empowerment created challenges for the NGO in effectively involving the right frontrunner actors who could put pressure on incumbent societal structures and institutions. We conclude that transitions in low-income contexts require extra attention to local empowerment and institution building to lay the required foundations for a locally rooted transition process. Development NGOs like the one in our case study have the skills to do this, but need to learn how to combine these with additional necessary competences to facilitate systemic change.",2018,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2017.08.011,C10,1,2018,Journal,0.131712315,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.211227953,0.118588101,0.249367307,0,0,0,0,0.768706079,0,0,0,0,0,0.013677002,0,0,0,0,0.137220601,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.044278104,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.130265693,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.114886801,0,0.081985808,0.10949568,0,0.121039784,0,0.13505507,0,0,0,0.046582135,0,0,0,0.070842849,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.371822791,0,0,0,0.034021582,0,0,0,0,0,0.105033814,0,0.102475939,0,,,,,,1,,,,,,5

In total, 33 rural coastal villages were studied for different uses of ecological indicators in seasonal predictions based on oceanographic parameters, hydro-geological, astrophysical, meteorological and biological conditions. We focused on oral dialects from traditional fishing practitioners, local community leaders and fishers as efficient respondents to carry out the study. In addition, we also attempted to develop a template of seasonal ecological calendar based on ecological indicators of Tamil Nadu coastline. This conceptualisation can also be absorbed on a synoptic scale as an integration framework of ITEK and scientific innovations. On the other perspective, it is so factual that adaptation of ITEKs in the current decades is in verge of extinction due to several factors such as modernization, technological advancements and waning intergenerational knowledge transmissions. In the face of losing ITEKs, it is crucial to integrate ITEKs in the scientific seasonal forecasting of environmental changes and climatic events to facilitate better decision making policies on adaptation and mitigation strategies. It is highly essential to build the concept of conservation and documentation of ITEK to solve the climate crisis and effective decision making.

The mechanisms for PC technology adoption have yet to be defined, which inhibits its diffusion in the construction market. This study aims to reveal the intrinsic motivation and action mechanism for PC technology adoption. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on the technology acceptance model (TAM), the study integrates characteristics from the diffusion of innovation theory to propose a multifaceted model for explaining practitioners' PC technology adoption behavior from technology, organization and environment contexts. The proposed theoretical model was empirically examined via a survey of 234 professionals in mainland China using the partial least squares-structural equation modeling technique. Findings The outcomes indicated that relative advantage, corporate social responsibility and market demand are significantly positively related to practitioners' perceived usefulness from PC technology. Regulatory support and trading partner support have noticeable positive effects on practitioners' perceived ease of use from PC technology. Perceived ease of use is found to positively influence perceived usefulness, and both of them have a positive influence on the attitude toward adopting PC technology. Attitude is further confirmed as an important predictor of adoption intention, which would lead to actual PC technology adoption behavior.

The purpose is to identify the factors that shape extended information seeking from the perspectives of psychological empowerment and attachment. Design/methodology/approach: A research model was developed based on prior theory and literature. Survey data were collected, and the partial least squares (PLS) structural equation modeling was used to verify the research model. Findings: Psychological empowerment is a well-constructed second-order construct, having a larger positive effect on extended information seeking. Digital libraries attachment has a positive effect on extended information seeking. Practical implications: Accessing digital libraries does not mean using digital libraries effectively. Managers of digital libraries should design various specific information activities to help users enhance psychological empowerment. They should provide more available and responsive services for users to enhance digital libraries attachment. Originality/value: Drawing on the adaptive structuration theory, this study examines extended information seeking by combining extended use of digital libraries and information seeking, presenting a new lens for digital library and information seeking research.

It implies in the creation or recognition of new forms of differentiation, the Opportunities Identification (OI). These may be due, among others, to new solutions or new problems to be solved, the latter a less explored path in the Product Development Process. There are studies aimed at systematizing OI, but present a discreet behavior in front of intuitive approaches. These rely on individual talent, a non-unanimous resource. As innovation is time-sensitive, there is room for artificial stimuli to intuition, which relies on the need for a close understanding of the phenomenon. This paper presents the descriptive research outcomes from a broader prescriptive study, which adopted the Design Research Methodology structure. Because OI is primarily a cognitive process and difficult to observe by a third party, one of the researchers submitted himself to the experience and recording of the phenomenon. The experience constitutes a unique case of OI accompanied during 2590 days. During this time, the study recorded 137 potential opportunities (units of analysis) by serendipity. Through the interpretation of the experienced phenomenon, the results comprise three perspectives: i/to the interaction of influence factors pointed out in the literature; ii/to the opportunities emergence; and, iii/to the opportunities identification. It is evident the challenge of considering opportunities as problems by its tendency of incubation. The work presents new research questions, hypotheses, and explanations valid to the case that potentially stimulate new exploratory or confirmatory researches or both.

In the supply chain, more and more suppliers endeavour to collaborate with buyers in order to develop new products and services. Trust is believed as a determinant of successful collaboration for innovation. Therefore, the purpose of this research note is to investigate the relationship between suppliersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ trust in buyers and supplier-buyer collaboration and how this relationship relates to radical innovation in the context of a developing country. This research note is based on a quantitative approach to analyse the data of 225 firms in Vietnam- as a developing country. The proposed model is tested with exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modelling (SEM). Findings show that suppliersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ trust in buyers can facilitate information sharing, joint decision making, and benefit/risks sharing among them. Furthermore, our results indicate that collaboration between supplier and buyers in sharing information, joint decision-making process can result in radical innovation. The results also confirmed that supplierÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s trust in buyers can lead to radical innovation through information sharing and joint decision making. The findings of this study have an implications for developing the long-term relationship between suppliers and buyers and help firms to achieve radical innovation in emerging economies. By having trust in buyers, suppliers can save time and efforts in communicating with buyers. Also, managers can encourage buyers to take part in the creative process to develop new products and services and help firm to gain the sustainable competitive advantages. This study also contributes to the literature by providing a theoretical model of successful supply chain collaboration and radical innovation, which can be applied in the context of developing countries. This study investigates the role of supplierÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s trust in the supplier-buyer collaboration in the context of a developing country to achieve radical innovation. Our study emphasizes the role of trust in the implementation process of collaboration in which suppliers and buyers share information, risk, and benefit and jointly make decisions on developing new products and services.

Startup teams are integrated or internal projects teams are provided with office space, independence and resources. Corporate incubators have become a promising solution for companies that aim at achieving structural ambidexterity, i.e. organizational ambidexterity that is embedded in corporate structure. While the current business practice shows that many different configurations of corporate incubators exist, the underlying requirements remain unclear. This paper therefore addresses the research gap by deriving a model describing the requirements for the organizational structure of corporate incubators. The authors draw from organization theory in order to derive requirement dimensions. Then, current literature on ambidexterity research is used to infer requirement parameters for each requirement dimension. From a practitioner's perspective, the developed model allows a systematic planning process that helps achieving a consistent configuration of corporate incubators, which reduces failure rates. From an academic perspective, the proposed model elaborates on the organizational requirements that underlie structural ambidexterity strategies.

Leadership, the formal and informal governance within an organization, drives an infrastructure system's ability to respond to changing circumstances. Due to the instability of the Anthropocene, infrastructure managers (individuals who design, build, maintain, and decommission infrastructure) can no longer rely on assumptions of stationarity, but instead that shifts are occurring at a faster rate than institutions and infrastructure organizations are adapting. Leadership and organizational change literature provide considerable insights into the ability of organizations to navigate uncertainty and complexity, and infrastructure organizations may be able to learn from this knowledge to avoid obsolescence. Therefore, this article asks: what leadership capabilities do infrastructure organizations need to readily respond to stability and instability? An integrative leadership framework is proposed, exploring capabilities of collaboration, perception and exploration toward learning, and flexible informal and formal governance leveraged by leadership. These capabilities are driven by underlying tensions (e.g., climate change, emerging technologies) and managed through enabling leadership, a set of processes for pivoting between stability and instability. The framework is then applied to infrastructure organizations. Lack of market competition may make infrastructure organizations more open to collaboration and, therefore, learning. However, the need to provide specific services may cause risk adversity and an avoidance of failure, restricting flexibility and innovation. It is critical for infrastructure organizations to identify their strengths and weaknesses so they may develop an approach to change at pace with their external environments.

We develop a model to address how institutional support initiatives affect the performance of export-oriented or so-called born global firms. From a survey of 250 firms from Malaysia, an emerging Southeast Asian market, we find that government support initiatives do not have significant impacts on firm performance unless examined based on processes of government support initiatives, international knowledge, commitment, competitive capabilities, and international performance. Government support initiatives play a critical role in export-oriented firms from small open economies (SMOPECs) in emerging markets by contributing to a number of contextual deficits that determine the international performance of a firm.

Following the logic of Ajzen's theory of planned behavior (TPB) and incorporating organizational learning culture (OLC), this study reveals the formation mechanisms underlying SMCEs' ICT adoption behavior. The behavioral model was empirically tested through a hierarchical regression analysis of 177 questionnaires completed by top managers of SMCEs in China. The results indicated that mimetic pressure (MP), strategic value judgment (SVJ), and behavioral control capability (BCC) can drive adoption behavior directly. Although normative pressure (NP) and efficiency value judgment (EVJ) do not exert direct effects on adoption behavior, their indirect effects on adoption behavior are fully mediated by adoption intention. The impact of coercive pressure (CP) on adoption intention and adoption behavior was not supported. In addition, OLC was found to be a positive moderator for the relationship between adoption intention and adoption behavior. This study extends the explanatory context of TPB and provides the feasibility for the industry to guide SMCEs to adopt ICT from multiple paths of intention and behavior.

Telephone numbers, E-Mail inboxes, or Internet Protocol (IP)-addresses are irrelevant to define us as human beings at first glance. However, with the omnipresence of digital space the digital aspects of identity gain importance. In this submission, we aim to put recent developments in context and provide a categorization to frame the landscape as developments proceed rapidly. First, we present selected philosophical perspectives on identity. Secondly, we explore how the legal landscape is approaching identity from a traditional dogmatic perspective both in national and international law. After blending the insights from those sections together in a third step, we will go on to describe and discuss current developments that are driven by the emergence of new tools such as Distributed Ledger Technology and Zero Knowledge Proof. One of our main findings is that the management of digital identity is transforming from a purpose driven necessity toward a self-standing activity that becomes a resource for many digital applications. In other words, whereas traditionally identity is addressed in a predominantly sectoral fashion whenever necessary, new technologies transform digital identity management into a basic infrastructural service, sometimes even a commodity. This coincides with a trend to take the control over identity away from governmental institutions and corporate actors to self-sovereign individuals, who have now the opportunity to manage their digital self autonomously. To make our conceptual statements more relevant, we present several already existing use cases in the public and private sector. Subsequently, we discuss potential risks that should be mitigated in order to create a desirable relationship between the individual, public institutions, and the private sector in a world where self-sovereign identity management has become the norm. We will illustrate these issues along the discussion around privacy, as well as the development of backup mechanisms for digital identities. Despite the undeniable potential for the management of identity, we suggest that particularly at this point in time there is a clear need to make detailed (non-technological) governance decisions impacting the general design and implementation of self-sovereign identity systems.",2020,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fbloc.2020.00026,C10,1,2016,Article,0,0,0,0.105049157,0,0,0,0,0.062322199,0,0.490253802,0,0,0,0,0,0.132412483,0.066432503,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.103134932,0,0.118061916,0,0,0,0.105335457,0,0.441469502,0,0.099263547,0,0,0.068643614,0,0,0.115413398,0,0.141820555,0.52239817,0.114764839,0.092639032,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1328168,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.128478602,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.059695574,0,0.142761359,0,0,0,0,0.109154403,0,0,0,0,0,0.101691693,0,0.122920522,0.211822342,0.096137315,,,,,,,,,,,1,8

Additionally, the research seeks to provide deeper insight into the link between the variables by studying how information technology (IT) resources mediate the relationship between knowledge sources and innovation capability. Design/methodology/approach: The study assessed the relationship between latent variables using a quantitative research approach and variance-based structural equation modelling on a sample of 380 individuals from 83 Pakistani manufacturing and service firms. Findings: The study's results revealed a significant impact of knowledge sources (internal and external knowledge sources) on radical and incremental innovation. Further, the study examines the mediating role of IT resources in connecting knowledge sources and a firm's innovation capability. Research limitations/implications: Future studies should investigate the association among the constructs under the moderating roles of environmental turbulence to provide insight into the relationship between knowledge sources, IT resources, and innovation capability. Practical implications: The paper provides evidence that knowledge sources and IT resources are the key driving factors of innovation capability. Managers and directors of firms in developing and emerging countries should establish firms' knowledge sources and IT resources to improve innovation capability. Originality/value: There is a scarcity of studies that has explored the relationship between sources of knowledge, IT resources, and specific types of innovation, namely radical and incremental innovation. The paper helps fill research gaps in the literature and advances understanding of how knowledge sources, directly and indirectly, stimulate firms' innovation capabilities via the mediating role of IT resources.

This study aims at resolving this one-sidedness contributing to unexplained aspects of entrepreneurship theory. Our focus lies on a subgroup of Main Street companies, known as hidden champions, as the counterpart of Silicon Valley high-growth firms, the unicorns. In spite of a worldwide distribution, just as unicorns are highly skewed to a few countries and regions, so are hidden champions. On a snapshot, it appears that unicorns and hidden champions are substitutes rather than complementary to one another. We illustrate that the emergence and skewed distribution of these two types of firms can be explained by the institutional context, in particular the provision of human capital.

Although a substantial body of research has emphasized that top management's transformational leadership is crucial to innovation, the mechanisms through which strategic leaders influence these distinct types of innovations remain unclear. Building on upper echelon and social learning theory, this study develops and empirically examines a model that investigates the mediating roles of three distinct strategic orientations (market, learning, and entrepreneurial orientation) on the relationship between transformational leadership and exploratory and exploitative innovation. Using meta-analytic methods combined with structural equation modeling, this study integrates findings from separate research streams, covering over 15 years of research, and using a sample of 215 effect sizes from 75 studies. The results from the partial mediation model reveal that transformational leaders play a key role in creating these specific strategic orientations which, in turn, support different innovation outcomes. Specifically, the findings indicate that transformational leaders promote exploitative innovations predominantly by building a market orientation, whereas they foster exploratory innovations by stimulating an entrepreneurial and a learning orientation. Hence, this study extends upper echelon research by uncovering the different mechanisms through which transformational leaders promote exploratory and exploitative innovations as it theoretically identifies and empirically validates the unique mediating roles of three specific strategic orientations. The results thus provide valuable insights for the challenging management of exploratory and exploitative innovations, as they provide a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œguiding mapÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â which reveals how transformational leaders from the top may use specific orientations to foster these distinct types of innovations.

As a result, more and more companies began to adopt a non-R&D innovation model to ease internal R&D pressure. Non-R&D innovation activities can not only effectively extend the life cycle of products or technologies, but also help companies make full use of their innovation resources to improve their innovation performance. However, the existing research on innovation management ignores the internal heterogeneity of innovation sources (R&D and non-R&D), especially the lack of discussion on the mechanism of non-R&D innovation from the perspective of network embeddedness. In addition, existing studies have ignored the impact of social, cultural, and environmental factors on non-R&D innovation, making existing theoretical models unable to explain practical phenomena well. As a result, this paper delves into the antecedent variables and contingent mechanisms of non-R&D innovation, and proposes a direct model and an indirect model between network embeddedness and enterprise innovation performance. The direct model explores the coupling relationship among the network embeddedness, non-R&D innovation and innovation performance. The indirect model explores the relationship between network embeddedness and corporate innovation performance under the intermediary role of non-R&D innovation activities, and explores the contingent mechanism of non-R&D innovation by constructing a regulated intermediary effect model. Therefore, based on the first-hand survey data of 200 manufacturing enterprises, this paper uses the hierarchical regression analysis and the Bootstrap method to construct a 95% bias-corrected confidence interval through 5000 repeated samplings, and to test the direct and indirect models. The specific values of the 95% confidence band and the significant field clearly show the mediation effect under the continuous value of the moderating variable in the form of a graph. The test results of the direct model show that the two dimensions of network embeddedness (structural embeddedness and relational embeddedness) help enterprises obtain high-quality resources, thereby promote the development of non-R&D innovation activities. Non-R&D innovation helps reduce the cost and risk of enterprise innovation, and enables enterprises to gain a competitive advantage. It is an important way to improve the innovation performance of enterprises. The test results of the indirect model show that non-R&D innovation plays an intermediary role in the relationship between network embeddedness (structure embeddedness and relational embeddedness) and innovation performance. Network embeddedness can effectively absorb and use the acquired resources through non-R&D innovation activities, thereby improving the innovation performance of the enterprise. This intermediary process is regulated by knowledge flow, that is, the higher the degree of knowledge flow in the network, the stronger the intermediary role of the non-R&D innovation activities in the relationship between network embeddedness (structural embeddedness and relational embeddedness) and enterprise innovation performance. Therefore, when the degree of enterprise network embeddedness is relatively high, it is easier for enterprises to realize the optimal combination of knowledge resources, thereby promoting the positive effect of non-R&D innovation on innovation output. In a word, this study interprets the path relationship of non-R&D innovation influencing enterprise innovation performance by introducing network embeddedness as an antecedent variable and knowledge flow as a moderating variable. This research not only expands the scope of innovation model, deepens the application of social network theory in the field of innovation, but also conforms to the development requirements of enterprise innovation practice. The research results provide guidance and suggestions for manufacturing enterprises to use network relationships to enhance non-R&D innovation capabilities and achieve innovation performance growth.

We used data-driven approaches integrating network and natural language processing techniques on 41 innovation core and ancillary journals to characterize the IR landscape. Contrary to previous efforts, we explored knowledge in the whole IR field from general and specific patterns of growth and interaction using cluster-and term-based data and macro-and micro-level perspectives, respectively. Our results helped us uncover the changing features of the IR landscape in recent years: (i) a strong move into social-and sustainability-driven innovation; (ii) the merging of products and services into business model innovation; (iii) the more influential role of stakeholders such as the government and the general public; (iv) the use of global analytical perspectives while considering local contexts; (v) the importance of greater visions ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpullingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â innovation; (vi) the greater role of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsoftÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â issues such as behaviors; and (vi) a shift into sectoral, geographical, and methodological diversification. Building on these aspects, we developed an emerging model for future innovation research and a series of IR propositions. Our findings help generate opportunities to build future innovation capabilities in research, practice, and education.

Five theoretical research hypotheses were tested after exploring. The research shows that through the modeling and calculation of structural equations, the current taxpayer enterprises in the Guangdong (Nansha) Free Trade Zone are increasing their demands for tax incentive innovation, propaganda channel innovation, knowledge counseling innovation and service optimization initiatives. However, from the point of view from the intensity of the appeal (standardized regression coefficient), the general taxpayer enterprises are significantly higher than the small-scale taxpayer ones. These new studies have found that it will provide a basis for deepening tax incentives, innovation and collection, and taxation services to propose tax policy recommendations to promote the construction of ChinaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s free trade zone.

Too often, the very mechanisms set up to facilitate knowledge flow militate against it. This is because they are instituted in a top-down way, they are cumbersome to manage and the bridges of trust fail to get built. In their thirst for innovation, the tendency is for firms to set up elaborate transmission channels and governance systems. As a result, staff are drowned in a deluge of mundane intranet messages and bewildered by matrix structures, while off-the-wall ideas and mould-breaking insights are routinely missed. Added to this is the challenge of operating across professional, cultural, regional and linguistic boundaries, where ways of sharing knowledge differ markedly, even within the same project team. Drawing upon extensive research with scientists in the ATLAS collaboration (a high-energy particle physics experiment comprising 3,500 scientists from 38 countries), we explore five paradoxes associated with knowledge exchange in global networks.

Business clusters stand out as mechanisms of innovation for not only the clustered firms but also the territory in which they are located. However, the cluster emergence process is complex and still unknown. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the orchestration process in the emergence of a cluster of innovation (CoI). Design/methodology/approach This study is a qualitative exploratory research in Porto Alegre, a State capital in Southern Brazil, in the region known as 4th District. Data were collected through documentary research, non-participant observation and face-to-face in-depth interviews. Findings Results indicate the importance of alignment among network members, possible difficulties caused by members' heterogeneity and the need to disseminate information and interaction for the appropriability of knowledge and innovation in the emergence process of CoI. Coordination of actions and joint agenda as facilitators for the construction of a cluster identity emerge as crucial important. Besides, results also highlight that the entrepreneurial process and the perspective of global strategy are essential to build competitive advantage to the region.

Nonetheless, many firms tend to overemphasize exploitation efforts, a situation commonly referred to as the 'success trap'. Previous studies have attributed this behaviour to managerial incompetence or myopia. However, some management teams appear to adequately recognize the exploration need, while not being able to bring about the required strategic change. We draw on system dynamics modelling to investigate this phenomenon. A simulation model is developed and then the behaviour of a selected firm is replicated to uncover the underlying processes. As such, we develop a process theory of the success trap at the managerial level, coined the 'suppression process'. This process theory describes and explains how the interplay between top managers, board members, and exploitation-exploration activities can trap the firm in the suppression of exploration.",2011,,,C11,1,2018,Journal,0,0,0,0.154783302,0,0,0.094652555,0,0,0,0,0,0.175957886,0,0.066126684,0,0,0,0.240584317,0,0,0,0.031241622,0,0.075981406,0.086730902,0,0.104481818,0,0.142407505,0,0,0.243929042,0.103486934,0,0,0,0.337140107,0,0,0,0.045913913,0,0,0.253648118,0.136497767,0,0,0.247965617,0,0.065264652,0,0,0.069523324,0,0.07823994,0.070638232,0,0,0,0.225555796,0.187275661,0,0,0,0.094564784,0,0,0.193918982,0.092161502,0.17734167,0.058141831,0.283957666,0,0.215763218,0,0,0,0.157768648,0.170051447,0.092320719,0.087727197,0.131936491,0.202067871,0.035058308,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.123553343,0.17318312,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,22

Design/methodology/approach Data collection consists of 16 interviews conducted with senior personnel at two firms in the biopharmaceutical sector, with sequences of organizational learning types derived from the associated innovation projects. These sequences and their differential emphases on experiential or vicarious learning are used to construct a conceptual model. Propositions describe the structural differentiation and integration mechanisms useful to foster organizational ambidexterity. Findings Technological brokering emerges as a key means by which organizations can reconcile the learning sequences underlying exploration and exploitation. For exploration, a structure incorporating cross-industry technology brokerage during the initiation and development phases of innovation is posited. For exploitation, a structure harnessing intra-industry technology brokerage during the development phase of innovation is suggested. Integration of these projects can be accomplished through cross-unit interfaces incorporating both types of brokerage roles, with emphasis on their use during implementation. Originality/value This paper considers the ways in which organizations focus on separate types of organizational learning at different stages of the innovation process.

The moderating role of risk-taking behaviour on the link between absorptive capacity and innovation behaviour is also investigated. Design/methodology/approach - Based on the principles of social exchange theory, the study design explores the complex relationship among knowledge sharing, innovation passion, absorptive capacity and risk-taking vis-a-vis employees' innovation behaviour within a unified analysis framework. Methodologically, employees in the information technology industry in China were surveyed via a questionnaire instrument, with a total of 318 valid questionnaires being collected online. Following a reliability and validity test of the questionnaire, the Smart PLS was used to verify the research model. Findings - Statistically significant results reported were as follows: (1) employees' innovation behaviour is positively impacted by knowledge sharing, innovation passion and absorptive capacity; (2) employees' innovation behaviour is negatively impacted by risk-taking behaviour; (3) knowledge sharing is positively impacted by innovation passion; (4) absorptive capacity is positively impacted by innovation passion; and (5) risk-taking behaviour regulates the relationship between absorptive capacity and innovation behaviour. Research limitations/implications - Owing to limited research resources, 318 front-line employees were surveyed via an online questionnaire vis-a-vis the sampling method only, specifically taking knowledge sharing, innovation passion, absorptive capacity and risk-taking behaviour as antecedent variables with implications on how employees' innovation behaviour may be stimulated. Originality/value - The mechanism of augmenting employees' innovation behaviour is chiefly explained from the perspective of innovation passion and risk-taking behaviour, which are conducive towards promoting employees' willingness to improve knowledge sharing and innovation behaviour. The social exchange theory is used as a basis to form an integrated model for the research, contributing to a cumulative theoretical perspective for future work on the impact of innovation passion and risk-taking behaviour on innovation.",2021,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JOCM-08-2020-0237,C1,4,2020,Journal,0.132470658,0.249309057,0,0.102227094,0,0,0,0,0.121295924,0,0,0,0.116211911,0.137570121,0,0,0.128855326,0.064647846,0,0,0.110744623,0,0.013755748,0.111368125,0.050182147,0,0,0.138010657,0,0,0.102505703,0,0,0,0.09659691,0,0,0.133599114,0,0,0.112312908,0,0,0,0,0.090150358,0.135404326,0.062788844,0.065507853,0,0.086208469,0,0,0.183667548,0,0,0.093306463,0,0.115879378,0,0,0.082457846,0.220252217,0,0,0.124911189,0.135832659,0.215998928,0,0,0.093700669,0.12799982,0,0.134554715,0,0.117556534,0,0.096855918,0,0.074873991,0.121946989,0,0,0.133456329,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.068434926,0,0,0,0,0,0.633831316,0,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,22

Findings - Key forms of knowledge must be shared by the two agents. Producers have to obtain in-depth knowledge about customers' needs and customers need knowledge on producer's absorptive capacity. Producers distinguish between three types of customers: reference customers, necessary for innovations with greatest scope, clientes amigos or test users, required to test innovations currently being developed, and traditional customers, associated with incremental innovations. The traditional means of protecting innovations is a detailed contract between customer and supplier; and patents are used for innovations of greater technological scope, as a form of defense against third-party patents and as a signaling element of absorptive capacity.

In doing so, it explores the role of knowledge acquisition and innovative work behavior (IWB) as possible mechanisms that underlie the relationship between performance-based rewards and radical innovation. The subsequent effect of IWB on promoting radical innovation is explored. The study employs data from 235 unit managers in manufacturing and technology firms in Jordan. Structural equation modeling was used to test for reliability, validity, and the hypothesized relationships. The results indicate that performance-based rewards positively affect knowledge acquisition. In addition, knowledge acquisition mediates the link between performance-based rewards and IWB. IWB is also significant and positive in promoting radical innovation. This paper is one of the first to examine how radical innovation can be promoted through IWB.

Additionally, the research seeks to provide deeper insight into the link between the variables by studying how information technology (IT) resources mediate the relationship between knowledge sources and innovation capability. Design/methodology/approach The study assessed the relationship between latent variables using a quantitative research approach and variance-based structural equation modelling on a sample of 380 individuals from 83 Pakistani manufacturing and service firms. Findings The study's results revealed a significant impact of knowledge sources (internal and external knowledge sources) on radical and incremental innovation. Further, the study examines the mediating role of IT resources in connecting knowledge sources and a firm's innovation capability. Research limitations/implications Future studies should investigate the association among the constructs under the moderating roles of environmental turbulence to provide insight into the relationship between knowledge sources, IT resources, and innovation capability. Practical implications The paper provides evidence that knowledge sources and IT resources are the key driving factors of innovation capability. Managers and directors of firms in developing and emerging countries should establish firms' knowledge sources and IT resources to improve innovation capability. Originality/value There is a scarcity of studies that has explored the relationship between sources of knowledge, IT resources, and specific types of innovation, namely radical and incremental innovation.

Particularly, it aims to examine the role of adaptive marketing capability in enabling market ambidexterity and incremental as well as radical product innovation. Also it intends to investigate the moderating role of transformational leadership between adaptive marketing capability and market ambidexterity. Design/methodology/approach Manufacturing firms in Pakistan, an emerging economy, are taken as the context for this study. A designed survey questionnaire is used for data collection. Partial least square technique is employed to empirically validate and test the hypothesized model with a sample of 192 manufacturing firms. Particularly, the two-stage approach in SmartPLS is used to validate measurement models, and structural equation modeling technique is used to test the proposed hypothesis. Findings The findings not only confirm that adaptive marketing capability is instrumental to both incremental and radical product innovations but also reveal that adaptive marketing capability serves an important antecedent to market ambidexterity shedding new lights on its mediating role in the relationship of adaptive marketing capability with incremental and radical product innovations. Moreover, the results find that the effectiveness of adaptive marketing capability to support market ambidexterity may involve a possible trade-off between exploitation and exploration when the leaders exhibit a low or high level of transformational leadership behavior. Originality/value This study contributes to outside-in strategic perspective and contextual ambidexterity literature by revealing the role of adaptive marketing capability as an important enabler of market ambidexterity which, in turn, allows the firm to simultaneously introduce incremental and radical product innovations. In this way, this study advances the current understanding of the antecedents and consequences of contextual ambidexterity. Also, this study provides insight into the types of capabilities needed for the firm's contextual and employees' behavioral adaptation to simultaneously manage exploitation and exploration within the same business unit which was lacking in the previous literature. Further, this study also offers a novel understanding of the conditional role of transformational leadership between adaptive marketing capability and market ambidexterity.",2022,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EJIM-12-2020-0520,C9,3,2021,Article,0.129771643,0.244229525,0,0.100144275,0,0,0,0,0.118824588,0,0,0,0.113844159,0.134767208,0,0,0.126229971,0.063330682,0,0,0.108488263,0,0.013475483,0.109099062,0.049159714,0,0,0.135198768,0,0,0.100417207,0,0,0,0.094628803,0,0,0.109064257,0,0,0.110024596,0,0,0,0.109406318,0.088313595,0.132645539,0.061509557,0.064173167,0,0.08445202,0,0,0.179925425,0,0,0.091405396,0,0.113518401,0,0,0.080777814,0.215764702,0,0,0.122366194,0.133065145,0.211598072,0,0,0.09179157,0.125391895,0,0.131813238,0,0.115161386,0,0.094882534,0,0.073348475,0.119462388,0,0,0.130737231,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.067040603,0,0,0,0,0,0.62091736,0,0,0.183297076,1,,,,,,,,,,,22

However, this method has been of limited use in practice since defining and interpreting patent vacancies, as surrogates for potential technology opportunities, tend to be intuitive and ambiguous. As a remedy, we propose an approach to detecting novel patents based on systematic processes and quantitative outcomes. At the heart of the proposed approach is the text mining to extract the patterns of word usage and the local outlier factor to measure the degree of novelty in a numerical scale. The meanings of potential technology opportunities become more explicit by identifying novel patents rather than patent vacancies that are usually represented as a simple set of keywords. Finally, a novelty-focused patent identification map is developed to explore the implications on novel patents.

We argue that dynamic capabilities are a set of specific and identifiable processes such as product development, strategic decision making, and alliancing. They are neither vague nor tautological. Although dynamic capabilities are idiosyncratic in their details and path dependent in their emergence, they have significant commonalities across firms (popularly termed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“best practiceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢). This suggests that they are more homogeneous, fungible, equifinal, and substitutable than is usually assumed. In moderately dynamic markets, dynamic capabilities resemble the traditional conception of routines. They are detailed, analytic, stable processes with predictable outcomes. In contrast, in high-velocity markets, they are simple, highly experiential and fragile processes with unpredictable outcomes. Finally, well-known learning mechanisms guide the evolution of dynamic capabilities. In moderately dynamic markets, the evolutionary emphasis is on variation. In high-velocity markets, it is on selection. At the level of RBV, we conclude that traditional RBV misidentifies the locus of long-term competitive advantage in dynamic markets, overemphasizes the strategic logic of leverage, and reaches a boundary condition in high-velocity markets.

It analyzes the mediating effects of incremental and radical innovation within the context of entrepreneurial firms in Turkey, an emerging economy. Design/methodology/approach - This study empirically analyses the impact of strategic orientations on firm performance through innovation with a sample of 818 small and medium enterprises in Turkey. To test the proposed model, LISREL is used. Findings - Proactive market orientation (MO) and technology orientation (TO) lead to radical innovation, while responsive MO strongly affects incremental innovation. EO impacts performance directly and indirectly via both incremental and radical innovation. Practical implications - Finding suggests that senior management of firms, especially in emerging economies should encourage marketing managers to focus on key trends of markets, both existing and emerging. These marketing managers should find and work with lead users to improve radical product development. This means that those managing marketing need to be well schooled in technology, and they should also possess a proactive MO. Originality/value - The present study employs a two-part view of the MO construct (responsive and proactive MO). This conceptualization provides a greater degree of precision in the use of the MO concept which was rarely employed in prior studies. Moreover, this paper views strategic orientations as drivers of innovation and examines how radical and incremental innovation mediate the effects of MO, EO and TO on firm performance. Finally, this is one of the few studies to look at all of these factors simultaneously and to include the two-part view of MO.",2017,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/MD-04-2015-0146,C6,3,2021,Journal,0.173850247,0,0,0.044719855,0,0.05741464,0,0.300904367,0.026530814,0.046467475,0.052175761,0,0,0.060180873,0.038210526,0,0.112737068,0,0.139018816,0.113427306,0.048445898,0.046724673,0,0,0.021952481,0,0,0,0,0.123432751,0.134525201,0.05998925,0,0,0.126770691,0.048582001,0.058861766,0.126628087,0.050547282,0,0,0.053061628,0,0,0.04885586,0.078873628,0,0.13733678,0,0.103747564,0.037712411,0,0,0.040173234,0,0,0.040817471,0.03258369,0,0,0,0.036071679,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.053254439,0.020494959,0.067193145,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.032754076,0.02667322,0,0.025412649,0.029190635,0.020258031,0.091091248,0,0.087284535,0.053411383,0.697012118,0.029937268,0.052024434,0,0.178484612,0,0,0.046212217,0.366294371,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,27

From the analysis of the body of literature on the topic, exploration and exploitation emerge as critical processes in the development of entrepreneurial universities. Nevertheless, the way they are balanced within universities is an under-researched topic. Adapted from the concept of organisational ambidexterity, this paper develops the notion of university ambidexterity to analyse the development process of entrepreneurial universities. To achieve this research aim, a conceptual model is developed by integrating the learning processes of exploration and exploitation to the previous theories used to analyse the entrepreneurial university. As already emphasised in other studies focusing on the role of ambidexterity in different research contexts, this paper proposes an idea of balance over time. The universities need to balance exploration and exploitation in their evolutionary path towards the entrepreneurial model, but it may be not necessary to invest in exploration and exploitation processes simultaneously. On the contrary, it may be most important to oscillate between periods of exploration and periods of exploitation to achieve ambidexterity over time. As a result, the tensions between exploration and exploitation processes generate a twisting learning path for entrepreneurial universities. Finally, the paper proposes an integrated conceptual framework which consists of six constructs, namely internal organisational environment, external environment, university exploration, university exploitation, university ambidexterity, entrepreneurial university performance. The proposed research hypotheses on the interrelationships between the mentioned constructs and the mediating role of university ambidexterity constitute potential areas of investigation to direct future empirical research and further develop the body of knowledge in the field of entrepreneurial universities.",2019,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2018.10.014,C10,1,2020,Journal,0,0,0,0.095150537,0.159642358,0,0,0.256093965,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.239870918,0.180518012,0,0,0,0,0.025607044,0,0.046708343,0,0,0.256914045,0,0.087542716,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.248701728,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.083909799,0,0,0.060973145,0,0.080240783,0,0,0.085476683,0,0.096193481,0,0.207985178,0,0,0,0.076749794,0,0,0,0,0.126429794,0,0.119208565,0,0,0.023827835,0,0,0.530547825,0,0.107242694,0.3606047,0,0.069690922,0.056752672,0,0.162211658,0.062108981,0,0,0,0,0,0.296606856,0,0,0,0,0,0.092109442,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,27

The impact of social media on diffusion of sustainable mobility opinions is not well-understood given the present lack of data. To address this gap, this paper introduces a modeling framework for the impact of social media on opinion diffusion. Inspired by Roger's diffusion theory, the framework applies different learning mechanisms (e.g., word-of-mouth and mass media) in network architectures to explore the effects of network topology on acceptance of green travel alternatives using conceptual idealizations of the complex processes involved in diffusion interactions. We present a dynamic agent-based simulation methodology capturing the impact of information and communications technology (ICT) like social media on diffusion of environmentally friendly travel mode consideration through social networks. The agent-based models provide visual comparisons of the effects of network structure and social media influence on opinion diffusion, the way opinions spread, and which agents exhibit the strongest influence. We identify types of social media influencers that most effectively encourage adoption of sustainable transportation alternatives and present an illustrative framework of the mechanisms that drive opinion diffusion. Exploratory findings suggest that (1) scale-free networks provide the slowest initial diffusion rate but the greatest overall diffusion over time, (2) the most effective behavior incentivization strategies depend on network structure, (3) in scale-free networks, increasing the number of initial opinion leaders improves diffusion, while increasing the number of communication encounters within the network over the first year following product deployment does not noticeably improve diffusion, and (4) providing smaller financial incentives to a greater number of opinion leaders is the best strategy.",2020,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tbs.2020.01.003,C5,8,2019,Journal,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.240075742,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.291229892,0.146112588,0,0,0.125148667,0.241404565,0.015544895,0,0.056709108,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.025162623,0,0.147407208,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.070955501,0,0,0.097421208,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.186365519,0,0.146059576,0.275140818,0,0.153499788,0.244092916,0,0.275140818,0.052943942,0.086788901,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.068904037,0,0,0.07540719,0,0,0,0.112739608,0.137975837,0,0.038667971,0,0,0.092214664,0,0.111831076,0.596892368,0,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,27

Furthermore, the results indicate that relational capital leads to radical innovation through facilitating information sharing among firms and helps in generating incremental innovation by encouraging firms to share risks and benefits with their partners. Practical implications - The findings of this study give some suggestions for managers of the firms in terms of building their collaborative strategies. Managers should exploit relational capital to build successful and long-term collaboration. Also, through relational capital, managers can share information to create radical innovation or pool risks and share benefits with their customers to achieve incremental innovation.

The market of infrastructural developments so derived is attractive for international construction organizations, including those in China. Moreover, these developments are complex technically, culturally, and even politically. Fierce competition among international contracting organizations can be expected. Although price competition is common in construction contracting, increasing competitiveness through cost-cutting is no longer a sustainable strategy. Cutthroat pricing may provide a short-term edge in bidding, but increasing competitiveness through innovation will provide the determining advantages in these BRI projects. To engender innovation, an organization must first have the capacity to do so. It is therefore proposed that organizational competitiveness (OC) can be harvested through building organizational innovation capacity (OIC). This proposition was tested with data collected from 102 construction professionals and using structural equation modeling (SEM). A positive correlation was found in this OC-OIC relationship. It was further found that core competence is the powerhouse of OC. The adoption of appropriate company strategies and project performance were also found to be significant components. For OIC, the results show that the ability to learn, manage information, foster entrepreneurship through appropriate human resource management policies, and cultivate innovation culture are key contributors. These findings and the suggestions derived there from were further explored in a reflective study of an organization with notable innovations. It was concluded that manifesting these OIC building strategies will enhance OC and enable organization to better meet the challenges of the international construction markets. Thus, this paper also provides suggestions on how to put these strategies into practice.

The paper is inspired by the concept of organizational ambidexterity in the public sector (Smith and Umans, 2015). By focusing on policy networks fostered by public administration with the aim of supporting small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) innovation, the paper elaborates on the links between firm innovation and performance and regional development. The cases analyzed are policy networks fostered by two publicly owned county development agencies in the Basque Country (Spain). An analytical framework emerges from bridging the gap between theory and practice. By understanding ambidexterity as a dynamic capability, the authors found that key ambidexterity drivers are related to network features (motivation to balance exploration and exploitation and diversity in terms of participants) and the individual feature of diversity within the network management group. However, other individual characteristics (leadership style) and territorial features (local institutional capacity) did not provide conclusive insights, calling for a deeper analysis and complex models to capture specific nuances. Design/methodology/approach The method used in the empirical part of the paper is the case study, as it considers the contextual conditions pertaining to a phenomenon (Yin, 2009) and helps understand present dynamics in specific contexts (Eisenhardt, 1989; Yin, 2009). Flyvbjerg (2006) examines common misunderstandings about case studies to conclude that social science may be strengthened by the execution of greater number of good case studies. Following his arguments, the authors consider that practical knowledge is also valuable together with theory, that is why the framework is not derived exclusively form theory but from the interaction and mutual influence of theory and practice. Findings The case studies lead to a discussion on the effect of network, territorial and individual characteristics (including management/facilitation modes) on network outcomes, including innovation performance of firms and network sustainability. Additionally, these cases show the importance of different factors as necessary conditions and key discriminants when supporting ambidextrous networks. The case analysis and the integration of the theory in this analysis allow observing the evolution of both networks, developing some conclusions on the core factors that influenced these trajectories, thus proposing an analytical framework. Specifically, it can be seen that some of the factors conditioned the ambidextrous strategy of the network. Originality/value The paper proposes the concept of ambidexterity as one that helps analyze the ability of policy networks to foster SMEs innovation. Managerial literature has extensively analyzed the importance of modes to foster ambidexterity within organizations (Gibson and Birkenshaw, 2004; He and Wong, 2004; Levinthal and March, 1993; Lubatkin et al., 2006) and also its individual dimension (Volery et al., 2015). Managerial focus on policy networks and its link to organizational ambidexterity thus remain understudied. Although private sector literature has explored both concepts, the relation between them has not been analyzed (Smith and Umans, 2015).",2020,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/CR-02-2018-0013,C10,8,2018,Journal,0,0,0,0,0.105896006,0,0,0,0.074889837,0,0,0.619397558,0,0,0,0,0.159114238,0,0,0,0,0,0.016985991,0,0.185899045,0,0,0.170419503,0,0.116139903,0.126576971,0,0,0,0.119280625,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.413723528,0,0,0,0,0,0.10645268,0,0,0.113398968,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.20364261,0.135986865,0,0.150323929,0,0,0.133360824,0,0,0,0.094834701,0,0,0,0.145162167,0,0.119600455,0,0.092456543,0.075291813,0,0.143467076,0.082397844,0,0.257127754,0,0,0,0,0.042252701,0,0,0,0,0,0.130445503,0,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,27

Design/methodology/approach In this study, the variable of managerial entrenchment, which includes the variables of management independence, dual role of management, management tenure, the board compensation and the board ownership percentage, was initially estimated through the exploratory factor analysis and its effect was evaluated on the dependent variables of the study using the test of multivariable regressions. Hence, a total of 103 listed companies on the Tehran Stock Exchange were selected and analyzed during 2011-2016. In this paper, the Jones model is used as the variable of accrued earnings management and for calculating the real earnings management, the models of abnormal operational cash flows, abnormal production costs and abnormal optional costs are employed. Moreover, the research and development cost to total costs ratio is used for calculating the innovation. Findings The results indicate a negative and significant relationship between managerial entrenchment and accrual-based earnings management; moreover, the entrenched managers are less likely to engage in manipulating the real activities accruals in Iran context. Furthermore, the findings show that there is a positive and significant relationship between managerial entrenchment and firm innovation. Originality/value What really sets this paper apart from other studies is that this research will make aware investors and stakeholders of this fact that managerial entrenchment will be a good way to diminish the manipulation of financial reporting and improve the corporate situation in emerging markets, particularly those bazaars facing with economic sanctions such as Iran.

Analysis of survey data on 383 social networking site users validates the theorized relationships. This study contributes to IS research on personality traits and adds to the trait hierarchical model by theorizing and empirically validating the nomological network of OSL with PIIT and CSE.

Design/methodology/approach After a focused literature review showing evidence of KM behaviors as a source of potential ambidexterity for IVCs and CVCs, descriptive, inferential and discriminant analyses on the 15 most active IVCs and CVCs in the world in 2019 are presented. Correlations between numbers of deals, prevailing entrepreneurial intensity and potential ambidexterity are investigated. Findings Specific differences are analyzed from a KM perspective, revealing that the number/percentage of operations per round can result as a misleading criterion of knowledge accumulation. Finally, a theoretical model for ambidexterity for venture capitalists is developed. Originality/value The study shows that IVCs act with greater investment capacity because of their organizational structure and purpose and focus on financial goals; moreover, they are ambidextrous, although their exploration may more frequently entail exploitation than real exploration.

While CSR has traditionally been investigated in the developed market, this paper demonstrates how MNSs can take advantage of their CSR practises and create business opportunities and innovation activities for themselves and local society in Vietnam. Design/methodology/approach This is an exploratory qualitative research-based on four MNSs that have practised CSR in Vietnam. Data were collected from 18 individual interviews with managers and business leaders in four case firms. Findings This study finds that CSR activities in the studied firms potentially drive new business opportunities and innovation in the form of product, process, idea and management practises. In addition, both opportunities and innovation also benefit MNSs and the local community in Vietnam. Research limitations/implications The paper makes clear that CSR literature varies depending on the different countries or areas where the studies take place and these studies tend to focus on a specific area that was appropriate within a particular socio-economic and political context. Given that the business context in Vietnam is characterised by opportunities and incentives for innovation from the socio-economic of the context of a South East Asian developing market, the research provides an important first step in the integration and consolidation of CSR practises, opportunities and innovation. In light of the findings presented above, the study provides an important contribution to the CSR literature, particularly the CSR practises of multinational corporations (MNCs) in developing countries. Practical implications The study suggests that CSR practitioners in Asian emerging countries should ground themselves in an understanding of the local society and try to gain an understanding of the priorities of local stakeholders. MNCs should develop an appreciation of the context in which CSR is initiated, as addressing such issues often inspires firms to bring in social innovations in the form of products, services and processes and discover or create opportunities based on the emergent social problems through business solutions that overall benefit their business and local stakeholders.

Using top-tier law firms as an illustrative case, we demonstrate how career path changes, initially made to address work-life balance concerns, had the virtuous side effect of enhancing innovation capacity. Our study fosters dialogue between PSF research and broader innovation theories, based on four contributions. First, we build much-needed conceptual clarity about what innovation means and the forms it takes in the context of PSFs. Second, we show that exploration and exploitation are not orthogonal but are connected and mutually reinforcing in PSFs. We conceptualize an Innovation Loop that captures the continuous morphing of one into the other. Third, we draw attention to the neglected role of career pathing as a determinant of innovation capacity by facilitating seamless transitions between exploration and exploitation.

The review reveals that the business model concept has gained an increasing amount of attention in process-industrial research, but it also shows that the literature exhibits a lack of construct clarity and that it is developing in different domains, depending on the perspectives scholars have taken to study business models in process industries. Specifically, while innovation management scholars have explored the relationship between technological innovations and business models as well as the process and outcomes of business model innovation, scholars from the domain of production management have focused on value chain (re)configurations and taken a system-based perspective to consider boundary-spanning exchanges with key stakeholders in the design of business models. However, despite variance in the perspectives, the review further shows that works in these divergent domains point to a family of emerging themes and to common ideas that have not been explored together. This allows us to identify the particularities of business models in process industries and develop a definition of process-industrial business models, which extends prior business model literature into the process industry context.

Design/methodology/approach The research applies an exploratory case study design considering an emerging-market multinational insurance company headquartered in Colombia. Four subsidiaries (El Salvador, Chile, Argentina and Colombia) and the Corporate Office (headquarter) served as the research sites. It also adopts an interpretive research approach providing a grounded theory framework linking international knowledge transfer and product innovation. Findings The empirical findings emphasize the central role played by the enablers (i.e. shared vision, empathy and knowledge sources) in facilitating international knowledge transfer, which, in turn, enhances product innovation. More important, however, is the detailed explanation that the paper provides regarding the enablers' microfoundational antecedents in terms of key activities that are performed at the team-level. Research limitations/implications The grounded theory framework was constructed using data collected in a single firm associated with a particular industry and regional context. The study only considered a single aspect of knowledge management (i.e. knowledge transfer). Other aspects of knowledge management systems, such as knowledge creation and knowledge application, should be used for explaining product innovation in EMNEs more comprehensively. Practical implications The study suggests a set of enabling conditions and activities that should be adopted by managers of EMNEs to improve international knowledge transfer with the aim of triggering product innovation. This includes the design of strategies for strengthening empathy among geographically dispersed teams by providing opportunities for regular live videoconferences among team members aimed at building close bonds, fostering trust and creating a sense of belonging in which participants get to know each other better and to establish a shared vision and a set of guiding principles and commitments for how the team will work. These suggestions are particularly important today when several multinational enterprises (MNEs) have been forced to rearrange their workplace by replacing face-to-face interactions with virtual work dynamics due to the COVID-19 crisis. Originality/value Previous studies have confirmed that international knowledge transfer positively influences MNEs' innovative performance. However, no studies have been conducted linking both variables in the context of EMNEs in Latin America in the service sector. The research tries to fill this gap. Besides, the paper introduces empathy as a novel enabler for international knowledge transfer and a moderator able to diminish the negative effect that cultural differences and geographical barriers have on the knowledge transfer process.",2022,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JKM-04-2021-0344,C2,3,2021,Journal,0,0,0,0,0.102455256,0,0,0,0.072456532,0,0,0,0.13883916,0.164355959,0.104354212,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.016434086,0.133052255,0.059952951,0,0,0.16488227,0,0.112366311,0.24492852,0,0,0,0.115404985,0,0.160753432,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.607346348,0,0.107703245,0,0,0.156525354,0,0.102993843,0,0.129746509,0.109714433,0,0.123470085,0,0.088987138,0,0,0,0.098512949,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.061168902,0,0.160753432,0.085123732,0,0,0.115714424,0,0.089452465,0.072845448,0,0,0.079720591,0,0.248773216,0,0,0,0,0.040879836,0.142080453,0.087605056,0,0.091099825,0.236455953,0.252414193,0,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,27

Firms may rely on organisational learning to acquire knowledge to drive the implementation of circular economy practices to achieve organisational sustainability and improve performance. Drawing on the resource orchestration, knowledge based view and the natural resource based view theories, we develop and propose a model that explores the role of intra and inter-organisational learning, lean product development, lean manufacturing practices and zero waste practices in advancing circular economy target performance and organisational identity among small and medium enterprises in an emerging economy. The study employs a quantitative research approach where the survey data is gathered from managers of manufacturing small and medium enterprises in Ghana to test the validity of the hypotheses using partial least square structural equation modelling. The results suggest that intra organisational learning require effective implementation of inter-organisational learning, whiles both intra and inter organisational learning positively impact lean product development, zero waste practices and lean manufacturing practices and zero waste practices. The results also indicate that circular economy target performance and organisational identity can be driven through the adoption of intra organisational learning, lean product development, lean manufacturing practices and zero waste practices. Thus, there is the need to promote inter and intra organisational learning processes to acquire knowledge from diverse sources to support the implementation of circular economy practices such as zero waste practices, lean product development and lean manufacturing practices to advance circular economy target performance and organisational identity.

Perhaps, no better example of this can be found than the rapid developments in Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR), that have recently made the step from the laboratories and specialized, bespoke training applications of the past, to the mainstream. Advances in VR/AR have opened the floodgates to digital internships, virtual labs, and novel collaborative and experiential learning. The magnitude and impact of these emerging technologies is also evident on the significant interest in their application and use in various commercial, professional, and industrial contexts. Examples of these include, but are not limited to, the entertainment industries, specialized training, corporate demonstrations and conferencing, and prototyping and modelling in the technical and engineering areas. Since universities play a vital role in moulding tomorrow's talents, integrating such technologies can help them not only by supporting teaching and learning, but also by contributing to related research and enhancing the learning technology frameworks in their entirety. The aim of this research paper is to briefly discuss the position of these emerging technologies in the educational sector in general, and explore what their role, impact, and structure may be in the educational systems of the future with a focus on higher education in the U.A.E.

Most importantly, the study looks into the patterns of international co-invention or the links of these locations to headquarters and other company subsidiaries. Design/methodology/approach: The study explores the cases of six US multinationals that file international patent applications in China. The applications were analyzed based on the composition of invention teams and the locations of inventors. Findings: The co-invented patent filings by US multinational enterprises (MNEs) in China demonstrate a high degree of USÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Chinese subsidiary collaboration. Links with other subsidiaries are marginal, and at the same time, high levels of sole patenting by inventors in China point to competence-creating research and development (R&D) activities taking place. Practical implications: The lack of subsidiary-subsidiary collaboration, especially subsidiaries in other emerging markets, indicates a less diversified strategy of leveraging internal networks of knowledge. This also implies that Chinese subsidiaries still lack attractiveness as partners in subsidiary-subsidiary co-invention. Only two companies in our sample, Procter & Gamble and Intel, demonstrate a highly diversified, integrated and transnational pattern of innovation management. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the contextual understanding of the rich landscape of R&D activities of major US MNEs in China. By exploring these cases, the paper identifies a number of trends. First, the R&D activities in this sample are highly concentrated in technological clusters located in Beijing and Shanghai. Technological clustering is an important advantage of the innovation landscape in emerging markets. Second, the paper underscores the importance of differentiating between different types of co-invention. The patent applications in this sample tend to unite inventors mostly from the US and China, and so multi-country applications involving subsidiaries in other countries are rare. Thus, the level of integration outside the center-host bandwidth is low. However, Chinese subsidiaries demonstrate high levels of autonomy by filing single-country applications, which implies that they are building their own research identity.

Design/methodology/approach: This study engages in an extensive scale development effort to collect representative data about the NBS in the Pakistani setting, complemented by relevant validity and reliability tests. The overall theoretical model was tested on 214 firms by means of a structural equation modeling approach, using partial least-squares algorithms. Findings: The results statistically supported the role of firm-level knowledge repositories (intellectual capital) and knowledge exploration and exploitation capabilities (absorptive capacity) as sequential mediators in the association of NBS and firm-level innovation. Besides, bridging networks of lateral ties among Pakistani businesses are found to be more effective than bonding networks of vertical ties in encouraging radical innovations. Originality/value: This study significantly extends the literature about the NBS approach. It provides specific sense-making mechanisms (i.e. priming, triggering and editing) about how abstract institutional templates constituted at the business system level are translated into firm-level actionable sets by the help of intangible resource repositories and processes that guide knowledge exploration and exploitation.

Hence, the focus of many companies up to date has been on the adoption of emergent technologies, such as internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence, big -data or cloud computing. Yet in order to stay competitive and to avoid disruption by a new market entrant a firm needs to adapt and even redesign its core business model in the context of the digital age.

Background The key factor to improving innovation performance in an enterprise is to share knowledge with other enterprises in the same cluster and use dynamic capabilities to absorb, integrate, and create knowledge. However, the relationships among these concepts remain unclear. Based on the dynamic capability theory, this study empirically reveals how enterprises drive innovation performance through knowledge sharing. Methodology Survey data from 238 cluster enterprises were used in this study. The sample was collected from industrial clusters in ChinaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Fujian province that belong to the automobile, optoelectronic, and microwave communications industries. Through structural equation modeling, this study assessed the relationships among ambidextrous knowledge sharing, dynamic capabilities, and innovation performance. Contribution This study contributes to the burgeoning literature on knowledge management in China, an important emerging economy. It also enriches the exploration of innovation performance in the cluster context and expands research on the dynamic mechanism from a knowledge perspective. Findings Significant relationships are found between ambidextrous knowledge sharing and innovation performance. First, ambidextrous knowledge sharing positively influences the innovation performance of cluster enterprises. Further, knowledge absorption and knowledge generation capabilities play a mediating role in this relationship, which confirms that dynamic capabilities are a partial mediator in the relationship between ambidextrous knowledge sharing and innovation performance. Recommendations The results highlight the crucial role of knowledge management in contributing for Practitioners to cluster innovation and management practices. They indicate that cluster enterprises should consider the importance of knowledge sharing and dynamic capabilities for improving innovation performance and establish a multi-agent knowledge sharing platform. Recommendations Researchers could further explore the role of other mediating variables (e.g., for Researchers organizational agility, industry growth) as well as moderating variables (e.g., environmental uncertainty, learning orientation). Impact on Society This study provides a reference for enterprises in industrial clusters to use knowledge-based capabilities to enhance their competitive advantage. Future Research Future research could collect data from various countries and regions to test the research model and conduct a comparative analysis of industrial clusters.

This study investigates how social integration mechanisms (SIMs; coordination, socialisation, and systems mechanisms) influence an incumbent steel companyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s absorptive capacity (AC). A micro-level analysis of two radical ideas from unusual sources contributes to AC and radical innovation literatures by exploring relationships between SIMs and four AC capabilities (acquisition, assimilation, transformation, and exploitation). The findings suggest that AC capabilities are context-specific with respect to innovation novelty and idea source. The results emphasise the negative sides of socialisation and formalisation mechanisms, and the positive effects of coordination mechanisms on the AC capabilities in such high uncertainty contexts.

It charts the changing trajectory of the social economy and different influences. Design/methodology/approach Qualitative data is used to explore views of members of social enterprises in Northern Cambodia. Three enterprises with different characteristics were selected. Semi-structured interviews and a group discussion took place in each case, exploring motivation, values, empowerment, participation, equity, innovation and risk appetite. Findings The important roles social enterprises play in rural community development are sometimes at odds with the reasoning of Western development agencies. The social economy in Cambodia is undergoing change with the advancement of capitalist market forces. This suits formal businesses but could exacerbate the exclusion of various community actors. Research limitations/implications Three case studies are in close proximity in Northern Cambodia, and the situated dynamics may not transfer well to other contexts. Some limitations are offset by the selection of different types of social enterprises. Practical implications The study gives insights of value to the designers of programmes or projects to support social enterprise who work within international development agencies and non-government organisations.

With industrial growth becoming jobless, the need for new models of social innovation is being felt all around the world to provide jobs to the youth, skills for the new economy and entrepreneurial opportunities for transforming resources and skills. The persistence of some of these unmet needs (also referred as wicked problems sometimes) or unaddressed problems for a long time shows that the existing institutional arrangements are inadequate for the purpose. Innovations are imperative. A socio-ecological system that recognizes and rewards innovation can withstand many external shocks, provided it is agile and innovates quickly to remain responsive to emergent challenges (Anderies, Janssen, & Ostrom. Ecology and society, 9(1)2004). Whether corporations will follow an open innovation approach to blend grassroots ideas and innovations with their expertise in a reciprocal, responsible and respectful manner (Gupta et al., Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity 2: 16, 2016) is still an open question. The design of appropriatemanufacturing and frugal supply chain will then become closely linked with other features of open innovation ecosystem. The debate on the role of social innovation in multi-stakeholder context in European focused on how these innovations fostered trust among different actors and influenced policy (Defourny and Nyssens. Social Enterprise Journal 4: 202-228, 2008). In this paper, we describe the market and social forces which influence the emergence of social innovations through various processes. We then look into the evolutionary pathways for social innovations (Mulgan, Innovations 1: 145-162, 2006), to avoid inertia and spur initiatives to bridge the social gap in an inclusive manner through mobilization of youth in particular. The ecosystem for social open innovations provides scope for connecting corporations and communities (Herrera, 2015; Gibson-Graham and Roelvink, Social innovation for community economies: how, 2013). Following the theory of reciprocal and responsible open innovation systems (Gupta et al., Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity 2: 16, 2016), we explore the way barriers are overcome on the way to reach the base of economic pyramid [BOEP] customer. Technological adaptability and institutional or market adaptability are explored to understand how communities get empowered to deal with corporations through an open innovation platform. The corporations need to be empowered to understand the decision heuristics followed by grassroots and community frugal innovators (Gupta, Innovations 1: 49-66, 2006). Just as communities need to be empowered to negotiate fair and just exchange relationship with corporations (Honey Bee Network, 1990-2017). Finally, we conclude with the recommendations based on the experiences of grassroots innovators that can enrich both social innovations and social enterprises following commercial as well as social business models for meeting the unmet needs of the disadvantage section of the society.

So far, however, we know very little about what induces organizations to focus on structural versus contextual ambidexterity, or how they combine the two approaches to maximize organizational learning. To shed more light on these questions, we investigate how the environment shapes a firm's use of structural and contextual ambidexterity. Drawing on a comparative, longitudinal case study of the four largest electric utility companies in Germany, we show that firms focused on structural ambidexterity whenever they perceived emerging opportunities in the environment as requiring organizational culture and capabilities fundamentally different from their own. Contextual ambidexterity, on the other hand, became particularly important when opportunities in the environment were both numerous and uncertain, requiring the organization to leverage the distributed attention and expertise of its frontline employees. We show that environments characterized by opportunities that are numerous/uncertain and require novel culture and capabilities lead organizations to invest in initiatives that combine elements of both structural and contextual ambidexterity-an approach we label hybrid ambidexterity. Our theory framework synthesizes and complements existing work that has started to investigate the antecedents of structural versus contextual ambidexterity. We challenge the prevailing understanding of contextual and structural ambidexterity as dichotomous categories and reconceptualize them as two ends of a continuum. In addition, we provide initial evidence that firms' ambidexterity approaches are influenced by managers' perceptions of capabilities and opportunities.",2019,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2019.1286,C19,9,2020,Journal,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.117741986,0,0,0,0.194531171,0.025053103,0,0.182791724,0,0,0,0.236118794,0.513893756,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.203404048,0,0.24660952,0,0.119308302,0,0,0,0,0,0.380591908,0,0,0.13565731,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.196697527,0,0,0.085327691,0,0,0.245062138,0.129767705,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.121530834,0.084341275,0.252829838,0.227031102,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.138878018,0,0,0,0.187712206,0,1,,,1,,,1,,,1,1,23

We conduct an explorative case study at Siemens AG. Siemens introduced a formal template process which can be adapted by the organizational units according to their demands. Results show that the extent to which the process is implemented depends on the level of closeness to core intellectual property of the organizational unit and the intensity of the involvement in OSS communities.

Design/methodology/approach: Using conservation agriculture (CA) as a case study, we deeply explore with 29 smallholder farmers why they are yet to obtain sufficient information to enable practice evaluation. Findings: Respondents asserted that their lack of information on CA was not reflective of a lack of interest in obtaining it, but of the unavailability and inaccessibility of learning opportunities. A deeper analysis revealed an underlying passive approach to seeking information and culture of financial expectancy. Practical implications: If extension systems are to catalyse broader sustainable intensification, we find the need for emphasis on (1) more inclusive extension mechanisms; (2) education of farmers about demand-driven extension; and (3) revision of direct input provision to lead farmers. Theoretical implications: While not contesting the value of farmer-to-farmer (F2F) extension systems for those socially connected to lead farmers, we find four research questions for further exploration regarding the practical application of F2F mechanisms that may impede their broader effectiveness, namely (1) Is extension coverage sufficient? (2) Do farmers understand demand-driven extension systems? (3) Do current incentive structures complicate farmer information seeking behaviour? and (4) Do current mechanisms encourage social stratification? Originality/Value: To date, adoption studies have largely utilised quantitative, econometric lenses that generally assume farmers are sufficiently aware of the technologies in question.

Tribes such as the Navajo Nation are seeking to strengthen their communities, create economic opportunities, and improve the lives of their peoples by encouraging members of their tribe to become engineers. Research investigating how Navajo engineers experience and understand engineering design and practice in the context of their culture and community can provide insight into how to engage Navajo students in pathways to careers in STEM. Purpose/Hypothesis The purpose of the study was to identify and investigate the ways in which Navajo engineers experience, understand, and apply engineering design and practice in the context of their culture and community. Design/Method A phenomenographic approach was used to explore the ways that Navajo engineers experience and understand the phenomena of engineering design and practice in the context of their culture and community. A total of 20 Navajo engineers were interviewed for this study. Results Four qualitatively distinct lenses on how Navajo engineers experience and understand engineering design and practice embedded in the culture of the Navajo community were identified as (a) Navajo-centered behavior, (b) Navajo-centered purpose, (c) Navajo-centered strategy, and (d) Navajo-centered application.

Recent theoretical works suggest that the Euclidean structure of space induces invariants in an agent's raw sensorimotor experience. We hypothesize that capturing these invariants is beneficial for sensorimotor prediction and that, under certain exploratory conditions, a motor representation capturing the structure of the external space should emerge as a byproduct of learning to predict future sensory experiences. We propose a simple sensorimotor predictive scheme, apply it to different agents and types of exploration, and evaluate the pertinence of these hypotheses. We show that a naive agent can capture the topology and metric regularity of its sensor's position in an egocentric spatial frame without any a priori knowledge, nor extraneous supervision.

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 200 IT firms and partial least squares structural equation modelling was used to analyse the data of this study and to test the research hypotheses. Findings: The results revealed that both customer involvement in social media and top management support (TMS) for social media had a significant impact on OI adoption. However, only the relationship between TMS for social media usage and OI link was mediated by knowledge management capability. Practical implications: This study stresses the importance of social media policy development for business managers to create an interactive platform for their customers to participate in the activities of the firm. Moreover, the results suggest that for developing open knowledge management capabilities, leaders must focus on and support the use of social media technologies by the firms. Originality/value: Social media technologies have taken the world by storm. Organisations and individuals are influenced by the knowledge available on Web 2.0 platforms. Most of the current research has focussed on the impact of social media use on OI in developed countries, but developing nations on the Asian continent have been left out of this discussion. Moreover, while most studies have focussed on the OI outcomes, less efforts have been directed towards understanding and exploring the OI antecedents.

Ecological efficiency is an important indicator of whether economic efficiency and environmental efficiency are balanced. Exploring ecological efficiency is vital for achieving sustainable development, as technological innovation, industrial structure upgrading, and ecological efficiency are probably related. However, there has been little research on the relationships among them. In this study, we used the super-efficiency slacks-based model (SBM) involving undesirable output to calculate the ecological efficiency of 30 provinces in China from 2008 to 2017. We found that China's ecological efficiency has risen, fallen, then fluctuated, and that there were significant spatial differences. Then, we used 3 spatial econometric models for comparative analysis, which revealed that the independent effects of technological innovation on ecological efficiency was significant and negative; however, technological innovation demonstrated a strong positive effect in tandem with industrial structure upgrading, and industrial structure always had a positive effect on ecological efficiency. On this basis, we added the cross-item of technological innovation, and industrial-structure upgrades had a significant and positive impact on ecological efficiency, which was significantly greater than the independent effect of technological innovation and industrial-structure upgrades. To explore the mechanism of industrial-structure upgrading and technological innovation on regional ecological efficiency, we set the first 2 as threshold variables. We found that there is in fact a threshold effect of technological innovation and industrial-structure upgrading on ecological efficiency due to the mismatch of periods. These results provide a theoretical rationale for China to formulate strategies to improve ecological efficiency. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2021;00:1-14.

This study intends to analyze the role of technology facilitation in creating an inclusive learning environment in the higher education institutions (HEIs), which would connect multi-ethnic students and academics effectively in the Sri Lankan context. Therefore, the primary aim of this study is to explore how technology facilitates inclusive learning in HEIs. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the qualitative research approach, this study generated data from 30 undergraduates and 10 academics from 5 national universities in Sri Lanka to evaluate the effectiveness of technological facilitation in promoting inclusive learning. The data were then thematically analyzed using NVivo 10. Findings: The nature of technology facilitation in HEIs and influencing factors such as the internet, search engines, mobile apps and software, cost involved, upgraded knowledge, time efficiency and technological devices. Further, the factors contribute to the HEIs and the benefits realized, such as information gathering, time-saving, cost reduction, information sharing, connective communication, easy learning and online services. On the other hand, challenges such as the involved partiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ resistance to technological change, inadequate infrastructure facilities, lack of technical knowledge, negative perceptions and behaviors, technical failures and health issues will also be assessed. Research limitations/implications: Implications for policy and practice include a thorough understanding of the nature of technology facilitation in an inclusive environment. The researcher has recommended some strategies and mechanisms to the policymakers that will guide them to use technology as a tool to enhance the inclusive learning practices within HEIs. Originality/value: This paper presents an original review and it contextualizes the technology facilitations in respect of the inclusive learning environment in HEIs.

The research undertakes an in-depth case study based approach. It uses data triangulation, where multiple sources of evidence (interviews, conference audio recordings and documents) are collected from the case organisation (a vendor) and its service ecosystem partners in the ICT sector. The partners included in the study are distributors, channel partners, competitors, and customers. B2B alliances are driven by the motivations to maximise strategic value and minimise transaction cost. Thus, using the ecosystem lens, we find that actors' capabilities (resources and perceived value), vendor's approach to achieving strategic benefit and the channel governance mechanism enable value co-creation. However, using the transaction cost theory lens, we report that actors' opportunistic behaviour, technological disruptions and new business model challenges lead to value co-destruction (in the form of termination of relationship, conflict and business liquidation). Alliance partners need to evaluate the strategic benefits of collaboration, knowledge sharing, learning, trust building, market expansion and technology sharing, considering partners' self-serving behaviour driven by transaction cost economies. All ecosystem actors are seeking to develop capabilities, exhibit knowledge differentiators, demonstrate technology leadership, reduce uncertainty and respond to new business model challenges thus causing value co-destruction.

Circular entrepreneurs intend to create social and environmental value while they build financially viable businesses. They are embedded in multiple institutionalised value systems that they are expected to adhere to. Those institutionalised systems provide circular entrepreneurs with different, in many cases, contradictory norms, values and guiding principles. Substantial amount of research has been done to date to examine the impact of institutions on entrepreneurial endeavours. And yet, research lacks sufficient insights into how circular entrepreneurs engage with the institutional structures in designing business models on a financially feasible ground while creating social and environmental value. To address this, this paper investigates how circular entrepreneurs respond to the value systems of surrounding institutions in business modelling and how two fundamental aspects of embeddedness, namely resource integration and value cocreation, are achieved within a circular business model that is coherent in itself and with the entrepreneur's ambitions. Both the institutional context and the institutional logics surrounding entrepreneurs are examined to comprehend the surrounding institutional systems more in-depth and extensively. By analysing a longitudinal in-depth case study, this article aims to develop better insights into circular business modelling and underlying mechanisms of embeddedness. The case is a born-circular small cidermaker in Cornwall (UK), namely Wasted Apple. The findings show that the circular entrepreneur is surrounded by dominant normative institutions forming the principles of business model design. circular entrepreneurs mark fidelity to the institutional norms to obtain a range of microcompetencies and to manage integrated hybrid tensions within the value creation system. And therefore, a circular business model is a more holistic and inclusive structure as compared to a typical conventional linear business model.

Exporting SMEs from developing economies faces many challenges, including lack of knowledge about institutions in foreign markets, inadequate knowledge about foreign institutions and limited internationalization knowledge (IK). However, research on the export performance of SMEs has thus far focused on the internationalization strategies of multinational corporations. This study aims to explore the effect of foreign market knowledge on SME export performance. The authors also assessed the moderating effect of employee absorptive capacity in the knowledge-performance nexus. Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopted a survey design to collect data from owners/managers of SMEs exporters in the Greater Accra region of Ghana. A total of 350 questionnaires were distributed based on convenience. Of this number, 257 usable responses were used in the final analysis. The authors tested the proposed model using partial least squares-structural equation modeling. Findings: The findings show that the three types of foreign market knowledge tested in this study, namely, foreign institutional knowledge (FIK), foreign business knowledge and IK have positive and significant effects on SME exportersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ performance. It also shows that employeesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ absorptive capacity affects the relationship between FIK and SME exportersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ performance. Originality/value: The study demonstrates the types of knowledge relevant to SME export performance. The study further demonstrates the moderating effect of employee absorptive capacity on the relationship between knowledge and export performance. The study advances existing knowledge on SME performance, especially from an emerging economy context.

Design/methodology/approach: Two groups of CFPs were created from a previous single-case study to examine the learning paths of the two groups. Both groups were digitally competent yet differed in their ability to adapt to the increased usage of digital technologies by their customers: adaptive or conservative CFPs. Research questions addressed perceived learning needs, learning strategies to meet needs and factors that helped or hindered success. Transcripts were coded based on the five elements of a learning path, described within the learning network theory (i.e. motives, learning themes, learning activities, social context and facilities), using the Dedoose coding software. Group findings were compared to identify similarities and differences in their learning path elements. Findings: CFPs learning path elements varied individually and between adaptive and conservative CFPs. Individually, they varied in learning themes: digital or traditional customer-facing competencies and learning activities such as learning from experience, self-directed learning and learning from others. Drive and ambition emerged as a learning motive for several CFPs in both groups. Although small samples, adaptive CFPs saw a need for digital competencies and engaged in self-directed learning (e.g. solving problems and using digital technologies), more so than conservative CFPs. A positive work environment (e.g. healthy relationships and support from others) was perceived as necessary for success for both groups. Originality/value: This study sheds light on how oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s approach toward technology influences the creation of oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s learning path. It shows the increased importance of digital competencies for CFPs in a digital world and how CFPs who embrace technology develop technological savviness, solve problems using online resources and experiment with technology and systems, strive for self-sufficiency and rely on self-directed learning.

By employing the data of 677 respondents collected from delivering questionnaires to small and medium-size firms in Vietnam in 2020, this study suggests a two-step approach that combines exploration factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and path analysis (SEM). The empirical findings significantly support our proposed model by demonstrating that knowledge sharing mediates the connection between all three elements of social capital and enterprise performance. At the same time, the results emphasize the importance of knowledge sharing as a major benefit of social capital and a substantial driving element of both operational and financial performance. The results show that all three social capital qualities (structural, relational, and cognitive) significantly impact both tacit and explicit knowledge sharing, while knowledge is one of the main routes connecting social capital to enterprise performance. Hence, our research model may be used in future studies to evaluate social capital, knowledge sharing, and firm performance as a new theoretical model. Our results offer a plausible explanation for how social capital improves knowledge sharing and enterprise performance.",2021,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.13106/jafeb.2021.vol8.no11.0133,C9,4,2018,Conference Paper,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.221358043,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.050206889,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.187066977,0,0,0,0,0.405340618,0,0.081270218,0,0,0,0.442716087,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.119548041,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.135929902,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.085499149,0,0,0,0.390085384,0,0,0.53026934,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.12488978,0,0,0.148917422,0,0,0,0,0.188089397,0,1,,1,1,,,1,,,,,7

We address key challenges faced by policymakers developing innovation strategies for emerging technologies. In particular, we explore ways that FM might be structured to investigate the complex innovation system journeys of novel technologies as they are developed, diffused, and deployed. In doing this, we draw on concepts from technology and operations management and related literatures to more carefully characterise the: (1) 'technical infrastrucutre' required to develop emerging technologies; (2) key technology transitions involved in diffusion; and (3) complex industrial value networks into which they may eventually get deployed. We investigate the extent to which these categories are already used within national technology foresight exercises. In particular, we review over 240 international FTA-related policy, strategy, and analysis documents for 'advanced materials'. We find that - although generally used inconsistently and unsystematically within FTA - these categories repeatedly emerge as important elements in many policies, strategies, and underpinning foresight exercises. We conclude by arguing that these categories should be carefully considered in initial FTA design. And that, by doing so, FTA exercises may better reveal potential 'innovation system failures' and help policymakers coordinate policy actions in response. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Similarly, eco-innovation is being recognized as one of the most important mechanisms that allow the transition from a linear to a circular economy in production processes, as there is a strong relationship between eco-innovation (eco-innovation of products, processes and management) and circular economy activities. However, the relationship between eco-innovation and circular economy is an issue that has been isolated and little analyzed in the academic literature. Therefore, this research fills this gap by exploring the interdependence between eco-innovation and circular economy. Design/methodology/approach: The research is conducted through an extensive literature review from where a research framework consisting of two measurement scales, 18 items and three hypotheses were developed. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed and 460 responses were obtained from companies in the automotive and auto parts industry in Mexico. The data obtained were analyzed through confirmatory factor analysis, descriptive statistics and structural equation modeling. Findings: The results suggest that eco-innovation of products, process and management has a significant positive impact on the circular economy of companies in the automotive and auto parts industry. Practical implications: The findings of this research can inform managers in the automotive sector and policymakers when formulating and deploying environmentally sustainable strategies. Originality/value: This paper fills a research gap by expanding the limited body of knowledge that relates eco-innovation and circular economy and providing some evidence of their relationship. The research also allows the unique characteristics of eco-innovation and the circular economy to be understood within a particular context, growing in this manner the body of knowledge on this field.

We then explore expectations of AI and ethics through a survey of members of the public. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for the role of AI in communication governance. We find that, despite societal expectations that we can design ethical AI, and public expectations that developers and governments should share responsibility for the outcomes of AI use, there is a significant divergence between these expectations and the ways in which AI technologies are currently used and governed in large scale communication systems. We conclude that discourses of 'ethical AI' are generically performative, but to become more effective we need to acknowledge the limitations of contemporary AI and the requirement for extensive human labour to meet the challenges of communication governance.

Method: an exploratory survey with a qualitative approach and a narrative method was carried out. Results: the data collected shows that the company does have a strategy to build and consolidate an emotional relationship with its users.

Studies have examined the Top Management Team (TMT) actions and decisions with the ambidextrous orientation of a firm. Further, studies have also shown that a behaviourally integrated TMT is positively associated with organizational ambidexterity. However, there has been limited research examining the antecedents to the behaviourally integrated TMT. Anchored in the upper echelons perspective, we have examined the influence of TMT processes and mechanisms on organizational ambidexterity. The TMT is observed to positively influence ambidexterity by enhancing the firm's ability to meet the differentiation-integration challenges, and by facilitating the effective deployment of ambidextrous Human Resource (HR) architectures for employee learning. Thereby, this investigation examines the effect of TMT processes and mechanisms in enabling structural as well as contextual ambidexterity.

The theoretical innovation of this study is to explore the synergistic effect of external environment and internal conditions on DT and put forward that the internal conditions play mediating role in the external environment and DT. Customer needs and digital strategies have great impacts on pharmaceutical enterprises' DT. Therefore, this study finds the main influencing factors, which are helpful in promoting pharmaceutical enterprises' DT.",2022,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/6756548,C19,2,2017,Conference Paper,0,0,0,0,0.197353176,0,0,0,0,0,0.137238397,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.148773393,0,0,0,0,0.015827978,0,0,0.131821721,0,0.158801221,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.153725103,0,0.150091588,0,0,0,0,0,0.103731024,0,0,0,0,0,0.375928474,0,0.105668038,0,0,0,0,0.400007951,0,0,0,0,0.446158246,0,0.071864194,0.156295118,0,0.147368087,0,0.107816171,0,0,0,0.081984271,0,0,0,0.23979152,0,0,0.133335984,0,0,0.10656978,0.079866057,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.113867592,0.121552433,0,0.118592282,0.322944506,,,,1,,,1,,,1,1,2

Recently, mHealth-related technology is expected to form a new category of medical devices particularly in the monitoring of patients. This is also anticipated to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of pharmaceutical clinical trials. However, there are challenges to utilize this enabling technology to innovate healthcare business. Considering this context, we explore the potential of mHealth. First, we position mHealth with respect to current innovation theories based on intensive literature review. Second, we hypothesize that mHealth has two potential areas of innovation: product innovation in the medical devices industry and process innovation in the pharmaceutical industry. To test the hypotheses, we conducted a holistic observation on clinical trials to examine how large mHealth impacts a treatment pathway by innovative products. Consequently, we observed 193 studies are registered; however, most of these remain at a primitive level of information and communication technology such as text messaging and application, which suggests a significant gap to the market forecasts. This present study forms the basis of the trend of mHealth and a future outlook from the viewpoint of technology and innovation management.

Focusing on rice straw bioenergy in the Philippines and Vietnam, our research explored how farmers' social networks can serve as a platform for social innovation - an emerging approach to energy transitions aimed at delivering solutions by empowering local people. Specifically, we used tools in social network analysis to map how farmers mobilise resources within their communities, who influences their decisions on the farm, and the stories embedded in their interactions. This allowed us to develop insights on how different actors in farmers' networks may be best connected to support collaborative partnerships and co-designing of solutions that meet their development needs. Our results showed potential windows of opportunity to engage farmers in bioenergy development. First, by connecting them to resource providers; and second, by developing capacities and network structures in rice farming communities to enable more resource sharing. Based on these, we propose a social innovation strategy useful for bioenergy project developers and local stakeholders to help ensure that farmers and other actors in the community can take active roles in the rice straw bioenergy development process.",2020,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2020.101717,C1,8,2016,Journal,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.152397695,0,0,0,0.292020157,0,0.219488027,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.139924285,0.063049468,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.169056203,0,0.29035254,0,0,0.457193084,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.131275731,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.649559049,0,0.078469979,0,0,0,0,0.117726676,0.03216411,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.07660785,0,0,0,0,0.087207377,0,0,0,0,0.042991242,0.149418781,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,1,,,1,,1,,4

Research has sought to explore the benefits of university science parks however, has produced inconsistent findings. Scholars suggest the need to look beyond internal factors such as the management, resources (human and financial), support mechanisms and business models, to consider the impact of external factors which may constrain or enhance the performance of university science parks. This research explores the factors which impact Turkish university science parks' patent performance. In particular, we focus on regional external factors such as how connections to triple helix actors, university type and how government supported technology transfer offices may influence patent performance within Turkish university science parks. The findings identify that the patent performance of Turkish university science parks increases when the science park is associated with research-oriented universities, providing all other elements are held constant. Mature, government funded technology transfer offices (TTOs) were also found to play a key role in increasing the number of patent applications. However, these effects change when considering the influence of having triple helix actor shareholders. The simultaneous existence of triple helix actor shareholders and research-oriented universities reduces the patenting performance of the university science park, when compared to research intensive universities without triple helix actor shareholders. Our findings provide novel contributions to university science parks in an underexplored context of Turkey and questions the value of patents as indicators of performance within Turkish university science parks.",2022,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10961-022-09929-x,C5,3,2019,Article,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.311096762,0,0.05030211,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.107528415,0,0,0.011409174,0.09236999,0,0,0.095291301,0,0.107528415,0,0.170038793,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.036936209,0,0,0,0.402416878,0.114467609,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.08666071,0,0,0,0,0.191674098,0.061778291,0,0,0.750402868,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.021232901,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.096111675,0.048182083,0,0.038408987,0,0,0.082745223,0,0,0.085141059,0.098637712,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.077595301,,,,,1,,,1,,1,,4

Briefly, this paper tries to offer a systematic and methodical review of the KS mechanisms in the SC to provide a comparative summary of the selected articles, to collect and describe the factors that have the influence on KS and SC, to explore some main challenges in this field and to present the guidelines to face the existing challenges and outlining the key areas where the KS mechanisms in SC can be improved. Design/methodology/approach In the current study, a systematic literature review up to 2018 is presented on the supply chain's mechanisms of KS. The authors identified 21,907 papers, which are reduced to 25 primary studies through the paper-selection process. Findings The results showed that the KS in SC helps to increase the success of the organizations, improve employee performance, increase competitive advantage, enhance innovation and improve relationships between supplier and consumer. However, there were some weaknesses, such as staff resistance to share knowledge in the SC because of fear of job loss. Research limitations/implications - There are several limitations to this study. This study limited the search to Google Scholar. There might be other academic journals where Google does not find their paper and they can offer a more complete picture of the related articles. Finally, non-English publications were omitted from this study. It is possible that the research about the application of KS in SC can also be published in other languages. In addition, more studies need to be carried out using other methodologies such as interviews. Originality/value The paper presents a comprehensive structured literature review of the articles' mechanisms of KS in SC. The paper's findings can offer insights into future research needs.

Our work aims to develop a shared awareness and common understanding of location and space, between machines and their users by building upon research into the numerical representation of the visual perception of space. Different structures in buildings like rooms, hallways and doorways form different, corresponding patterns in these representations. Thanks to recent advances in the field of deep learning with neural networks, it now seems possible to explore the idea of automatically learning these recurring structures. This article presents a complete framework: starting from the collection of isovist measures along geospatial trajectories on indoor floor plans, over statistical data analysis, the unsupervised extraction of meaningful structure, up to the training of models that generalize to different environments. We show that isovist measures do reflect the recurring structures found in different buildings, that these recurring patterns are encoded in the data in a way that unsupervised machine learning can identify them andthat the identified structures are meaningful as they represent human relatable concepts.

The research results provide a clear model and reference for the government to guide scientific research teams in conducting science popularization works in an orderly manner.",2019,Conference Paper,,C13,1,2017,Journal,0,0,0,0.081891021,0.206093565,0.105137718,0.100155433,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.330609739,0.069971135,0.15897529,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.011019312,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.075343372,0,0,0,0,0,0.088963385,0,0.071348129,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.149489948,0,0,0,0,0.066054477,0,0.828298187,0,0.05003128,0.108811418,0,0,0,0,0.041014707,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.037096516,0,0,0,0.097806952,0,0,0.095267171,0,0,0,0.079273711,0.084623836,0.095822634,0,0,,,,,1,1,1,,,1,1,4

The technological substance of this growth, however, has become increasingly doubted as China's governments continue to promote patenting as a target per se. Against this background, the paper explores the structure of Chinese patenting from a regional perspective. Firstly, it analyses the technological profile, public component and outward orientation of specific provinces' technological ecosystems. Secondly, it connects these specific profiles to regions' recent growth in patent applications. Concluding, it finds that there are indications of both politically induced and technologically substantial growth in applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper will further explore whether there is a moderating role of learning orientation in the mechanism of Internet integration capability affecting enterprise knowledge generation. Background The Internet has gradually integrated into the enterprise innovation system and penetrated into all aspects of technological innovation, which has promoted the integration and optimization of resources inside and outside the organization. However, there is limited understanding of how the combination of the Internet and integration capability can drive enterprise knowledge generation. Methodology The study uses survey data from 399 organizations in China. Through structural equation modeling, this study assesses the relationship between Internet integration capability, organizational learning, knowledge generation, and uses PROCESS macro program to test the mediated moderation effect of learning orientation. Contribution First, this study provides empirical evidence for managers to better build Internet integration capability and ambidextrous learning to promote enterprise knowledge generation. Second, this study highlights the important moderating role of learning orientation in the mediating role of ambidextrous learning. Findings First, the study confirms the mediating role of exploratory learning and exploitative learning in knowledge generation driven by Internet integration capability. Second, the results show that when organizations have a strong learning orientation, the indirect path of Internet integration capability influencing knowledge generation through exploratory learning will be enhanced. Recommendations Enterprises should pay full attention to the improvement of internet integra-for Practitioners tion capability and ambidextrous learning to promote knowledge generation. In addition, enterprises should establish a good learning atmosphere within the organization to strengthen the bridge role of exploratory learning between Internet integration capability and knowledge generation. Recommendations Researchers could collect data from countries with different levels of ecofor Researchers nomic development to verify the universal applicability of the proposed theoretical model. Impact on Society This study provides references for enterprises using Internet integration capability to promote their knowledge generation capability under the internet background. Future Research Future research can compare the impact of Internet integration capability on knowledge generation in different industries. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2020 Informing Science Institute.

Compared to the traditional assumption that product companies shift toward solutions during the maturity phase, companies can already offer solutions in the market development phase. We investigate the dynamic capabilities for providing solutions in the market development phase. Our findings reveal a microfoundation of dynamic capabilities. This microfoundation is structured into 10 dimensions along sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring activities. Within these 10 dimensions, we disaggregate the dynamic capabilities into individual skills and organizational routines. Interestingly, organizations utilize routines underlying the options for each dimension (e.g., routines for sensing internal and external opportunities, seizing standardization, and customization), but they tend to stick to routines for one of these options. Individual skills enable organizations to balance the options.

The challenge that complex problems pose to boundedly rational managers-the need to find a high-performing combination of interdependent choices-is akin to identifying a high peak on a rugged performance landscape that managers must discover through sequential search. Building on the NK model that Levinthal introduced into the management literature in 1997, scholars have used simulation methods to construct performance landscapes and examine various aspects of effective search processes. We review this literature to identify common themes and mechanisms that may be relevant in different managerial contexts. Based on a systematic analysis of 71 simulation studies published in leading management journals since 1997, we identify six themes: learning modes, problem decomposition, cognitive representations, temporal dynamics, distributed search, and search under competition. We explain the mechanisms behind the results and map all of the simulation articles to the themes. In addition, we provide an overview of relevant empirical studies and discuss how empirical and formal work can be fruitfully combined. Our review is of particular relevance for scholars in strategy, entrepreneurship, or innovation who conduct empirical research and apply a process lens. More broadly, we argue that important insights can be gained by linking the notion of search in rugged performance landscapes to practitioner-oriented practices and frameworks, such as lean startup or design thinking.",2019,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0149206318808594,C5,1,2022,Article,0,0,0.120898941,0,0.077296268,0,0,0.123996588,0,0.09574152,0,0,0,0,0.078728914,0.089436537,0.232283297,0.058269283,0.095478058,0,0,0,0.01239852,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.100347821,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.081255556,0,0,0,0,0,0.490793013,0,0,0.094175486,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.099260374,0.698977699,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.064220685,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.052360187,0.060144344,0.083479237,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.274917138,0,0.095215588,0,0,0.08432397,,,1,,,1,1,,,,1,2

Recent research identifies how integration strategies enable individual projects to break from this trap, but much less is known about potential strategic action of firms to enable systemic innovation. To explore this, a longitudinal comparative case study examines how three entrepreneurial firms - DPR construction, RAD Urban, and Project Frog - in the San Francisco Bay Area describe their own strategic evolution and restructuring of firm boundaries over the past five years to enable greater adoption of digital manufacturing. Each firm has developed a different approach - relational, project-based spinoff; vertical integration; or digital systems integration. Benefits and challenges are identified for each. The approaches are theorized as a form of strategic mirror-breaking intended to redefine the current paradigm of knowledge and task dependencies. They enable the firms to develop products with new system architectures and access more opportunities for innovation in digitally-enabled manufacturing. The paper concludes with discussion of how the identification and characterization of strategies for mirror-breaking enriches understanding of integration for systemic innovation in construction at the firm level.

Given the potential of text mining as a method of inquiry, the primary purpose of this manuscript is to enable both novice and more experienced innovation researchers to select, specify, document, and interpret text mining techniques in a way that generates valid and reliable knowledge for the innovation management community. This involved taking stock of text mining applications in the field of innovation research to date by means of a systematic review of 124 journal articles employing text mining techniques and are published in a basket of the 10 premier innovation management and 8 top general management journals. The results of the systematic manual and computational analysis of these articles do not only illustrate the state and evolution of text mining applications in our field, but also allow for evidence-based recommendations regarding their future use.

These technological transformations have the ability to deepen, enrich, and adaptively guide learning and interaction, but they also hold potential risks for neglecting people's affective learning processesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âthat is, learners' emotional experiences and expressions in learning. We argue that technologies and their usage in particular should be designed with the goal of enhancing learning and interaction that acknowledges both fundamental aspects of learning: cognitive and affective. In our empirical research, we have explored the possibility of using various types of emerging digital tools as individual and group support for cognitively effortful and affectively meaningful learning. We present four case studies of experiments dealing with social networking systems, programming with computer games, and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmakers cultureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â and digital fabrication as examples of digital education. All these experiments investigate novel ways of technological integration in learning by focusing on their affective potential. In the first study, a social networking system was used in a higher education context for providing a forum for online learning. The second study demonstrates a Minecraft experiment as game-based learning in primary school education. Finally, the third and the fourth case study showcases examples of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmakerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â contexts and digital fabrication in early education and in secondary school. It is concluded that digital systems and tools can provide multiple opportunities for affective learning in different contexts within different age groups. As a pedagogical implication, scaffolding in both cognitive and affective learning processes is necessary in order to make the learning experience with emerging digital tools meaningful and engaging.

These communities are defined as groups of people who have a common interest in solving local social problems and, consequently, contributing to the development of Smart Territories. Based on the definition of Smart Cities and Social Innovation Communities, the concept of Impact Communities (IC) is used, that is, communities where collaboration and sharing have the ultimate goal of contributing to the construction of territories that seek their development in a sustainable way. To this end, the path is to create or maintain Social Entrepreneurship initiatives, with the human being at the centre of this intervention. This paper will also discuss the importance of communication networks between communities and among social entrepreneurs belonging to these communities, using, for this purpose, the Actor-Network Theory (ANT), through which the social production of knowledge, the human and non-human actors in the process and its application in the development of Smart Territories will be analysed. The question that guides the article is: What contributions Impact Communities' networks give to the development of Smart Territories? Through this question we want to cross the path of IC creation and the result of the intervention in the territory, analysing the communication processes and the tools used. Therefore, the objectives of the paper are to contribute to the: A) theoretical and practical knowledge in Impact Communities; b) development of the concept of Smart Territories, with reference to social entrepreneurs; c) to apply the conceptual framework of Actor-Network Theory in a specific context of communities and Social Entrepreneurship. In order to meet the objectives and find a response to the guiding question, an IC will be analysed, implemented in a territory with a low population density and mostly rural, exploring the reasons that gave rise to the IC, how its maintenance is carried out and how communications are carried out between its members.

Although research has highlighted the importance of value creation and capture of business models, it primarily focused on the value creation mechanisms and neglected aspects of value capturing: Until to date, little is known about how firms attempt to protect their business models from competition, which is a critical component of value capture. Drawing on a sample of 24 cases, we explore how business models relate to IP protection mechanisms for value capture and derive a business model protection framework. Our empirical study reveals that the choice of IP protection is contingent on the applied business model. Whereas some razor and blade business models are characterised by a high degree of both formal and informal protection, firms operating franchising business models put higher emphasis on informal protection strategies. Firms running the pay-per-use business model or the multi-sided platform business model apply formal and informal protection strategies to a medium degree in order to capture value. Our findings extend business model literature on novel insights on intellectual property management and also extend the 'profiting from innovation literature' on protection mechanisms in the context of business models.

However, entrepreneurial leadership (EL) is an emerging leadership style which is still in the early stages both conceptually and theoretically. This study aims to explore the relationships between EL and organisational innovation (OI) with an intervening effect of innovation climate (IC). Data were collected from 279 respondents within textile sector of Pakistan. Data were analysed using four core statistical techniques, i.e., descriptive statistics, convergent validity test, discriminate analysis, and structural equation modelling. First, the results showed a positive effect between EL and OI. Second, the findings unveiled the positive association between EL and OI through mediating influence of IC. This study contributes to the leaderships' literature by highlighting the significance of entrepreneurial leadership performance mechanism for organisational innovation. Furthermore, this study offers several managerial and theoretical implications alongside future opportunities for practitioners and research scholars.

Design/methodology/approach: By means of structural equation modeling with latent variables, a new type of synthetic index is developed, with which the evolution and incidence of human capital structure, human resources development, and R&amp;D in the companyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s accumulated resiliency can be tested. Findings: The results indicate a remarkable contribution of human capital to company resilience (standardized path coefficient 0.8365; p&lt;0.0001 and R2=0.7486). Differences in company-nurtured resilience are related to categories such as productivity, products diversification, human capital structure, human resources management, innovation results, technology, and a productive environment. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation is that the applied literature on this topic is scarce in economics and focused on company survival. Practical implications: Management for resilience requires the development of the ability to balance efficiency in the short term with adaptability in the medium and long term. Recruitment and training and development policies should consider the role of emotions and motivation in creative thinking and innovation. Originality/value: Most research on the topic has been conducted within the ecological resilience approach. The adaptive resilience approach is considered an integrated framework based on the internal perspective of company capabilities, the theory of complex adaptive systems, and the Schultz-Nelson/Phelps view on human capital.

While existing job profiles are changing, new job profiles are getting created. Professionals face the challenge of obsolescence and pressure for continuous reskilling and prepare for the future of work. The fast-changing innovations in digital technologies of IIoT like the internet of things, robotics, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and big data analytics trigger in-depth analysis of professionals' learning behavior. This study extends the individual's ambidextrous learning theory and unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) to develop a quantitative behavioral model Learning Emerging Digital Skills (LEDS). LEDS model describes the antecedents of professionals' learning behavior towards fast-changing emerging digital technologies involved in IIoT. A nation-wide structured survey of 685 professionals across 95 firms in India across industry sectors engaged in IIoT product and solution development in sectors like automotive, aerospace, healthcare, and energy were undertaken. Findings from structural equation modeling are validated via a qualitative study. Social influence and personal innovativeness, anxiety, long-term consequence, and job relevance affect behavioral intention to learn. Professionals' performance level and technology preference moderate the relationship between antecedents and the intention to learn. For exceptional performers, personal innovativeness is the key driver in the intention to learn. For average performers, social influence and anxiety are additional significant factors towards intention to learn. Technology itself moderates the learning behavior, which indicates professionals' preference to learn a technology over the other based on technology maturity and use potential. This study can help practitioners design ramp-up strategies to meet the current and future demand of emerging digital skills to meet their IIoT strategy. Policymakers can use antecedents of employees' ambidextrous learning behavior to formulate policies to achieve ambidextrous organization's goals.

Patents on foundational techniques with broad applications have the potential to deter innovation in the field, should the privatization of key components of artificial intelligence be used to exclude third-party innovators. This chapter studies patent applications in the US and demonstrates the extent to which the field has grown over the last twenty years. It then seeks to explore foundational patents by focusing on triadic patents: patents filed jointly with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office, and the Japanese Patent Office. The results of this chapter indicate an increasingly globalized AI field. A proverbial land grab seems to be occurring; an increase in AI patenting, particularly the protection of triadic patents, illustrates industry players aggressively attempting to own the building blocks of a rapidly emerging market. A number of policy levers are presented, highlighting how the patent offices and courts can counter the patenting of foundational patents by relying on strict and narrow patentability standards.

Methods: To analyze the vertical evolution process and mechanism of business model innovation of M&As in the context of big data, nested case studies are chosen. Results: For exploratory M&As, Alibaba adopts novelty-oriented business model innovation mechanisms; For exploitative M&As, Alibaba adopts efficiency-oriented business model innovation mechanisms. For the former, Alibaba expands new business in content; in terms of structure, it improves the value chain, innovates key processes, expands the value network, meets customer value propositions, optimizes profit models and customer interfaces, and has a higher degree of integration in governance. For the latter, Alibaba strengthens existing businesses in content; in terms of structure, it optimizes the customer interface, meets customer value propositions, and expands the value network and has a lower degree of integration in governance. Conclusions: Both exploratory and exploitative M&As could achieve value creation through specific business model innovation mechanisms. Exploratory M&As are suitable for novelty-oriented business model innovation, exploitative M&As should carry out efficiency-oriented business model innovation.

To provide this knowledge and assessment, this study identifies technology innovations being developed and advanced in government, industry, and academia that are impactful and relevant to NASA. This paper showcases specific emerging and disruptive technologies within specific disciplines, including artificial intelligence, miniaturized systems, autonomous systems, big data analytics, machine learning and advanced engineered materials. These areas could provide breakthrough solutions that would enable NASA missions and enhance specific industries. This paper also describes how nearly 500 technology trends from around the world covering a broad spectrum of technology areas were identified, verified, and assessed by the NASA Center Chief Technologist Council, Technology Trends team. From the trends collected, Center Chief Technologist selected nine ""high interest"" emerging and disruptive technology areas. Agency leadership can use this overview of innovative technology development outside NASA to identify transformational technologies; foster collaborations within and outside the air and space domains; and assess when to make, buy, lead, leverage, adopt, or watch key transformational technologies. This assessment could be used also to identify partnerships and to enable breakthrough progress toward enabling exploration missions. Ultimately, NASA can leverage the analysis of this study and make decisions regarding investments internal and external to the Agency.

In the context of global Internet development and the widespread use of digital technologies, this study develops an evaluation system to measure China's digital economy by using provincial panel data from 2007 to 2019. Four dimensions are covered, including digital economy development carrier, digital industrialization, industrial digitalization, and digital economy development environment. Based on a comprehensive explanation of the influence mechanism, generalized method of moments and other econometric methods are used to examine the direct effect of digital economy on LCD. An intermediary effect model is then applied to explore its indirect transmission mechanism, followed by several heterogeneity analyses. The results show that digital economy is gradually becoming an essential driver for regional low-carbon development. Environmental governance, technological innovation, and industrial structure upgrade are the three primary channels for digital economy to influence LCD. The intermediary role of industrial structure upgrade is the largest, while technological innovation is the smallest. Results of heterogeneity analysis show that the decarbonization of digital economy is better in the eastern region but not significant in the central and western regions.

Design/methodology/approach - The perspectives of 47 key informants, predominantly representatives of public and private Uruguayan institutions, including chambers of commerce and producer associations, were gathered through unstructured, face-to-face interviews. Findings - Aligned with the KBTF, the significance of tacit knowledge, complemented with explicit knowledge, was revealed, particularly in the more traditional industries. Indeed, industry-based (tacit) knowledge evolving for generations has been strengthened by innovative practices, enhancing the appeal and image of key commodities and the nation's exports. Additional elements highlighted in the KBTF, such as problem-solving, knowledge integration and application and knowledge specialisation, were identified. Originality/value - Essentially, the study highlights the different associations between the KBTF, the various forms of acquiring knowledge (tacit, explicit), innovation and resulting impacts on food quality and increased product recognition for a developing economy. Moreover, the findings, which illustrate that crucial improvements can be achieved through knowledge-based approaches, could also be considered in the context of other emerging economies that are aiming to attain further socioeconomic development through maximising the benefits of knowledge.

Structural equation modeling was used to test hypothesized relationships. Findings First, the research confirmed the existence of bullying hiding behaviors in the knowledge economy era based on knowledge power. Second, the findings suggest that knowledge attributes are an important predictor of KH behaviors in organizations. The findings implicate the mediating effect of interpersonal distrust and the moderating role of team efficacy, while team efficacy negatively moderated the relationships between interpersonal distrust with evasive hiding and playing dumb, but positively moderated the relationship between interpersonal distrust with rationalized hiding and bullying hiding. Originality/value This is the first study to propose bullying hiding, a behavior that has emerged in organizational knowledge transfer, and it is more detrimental to knowledge sharing than other KH behaviors. The results of research on the different regulating effects of team efficacy on KH behaviors enrich the boundary conditions of KH research.",2021,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JKM-04-2020-0256,C3,4,2017,Conference Review,0,0,0,0,0.090281241,0.138169724,0,0,0.383082287,0,0,0,0.122341909,0,0,0,0,0.068057919,0,0,0,0,0.028962685,0.11724262,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.203384494,0,0,0,0.243286522,0.137321883,0,0.063847048,0,0.107035957,0,0,0,0,0.06896329,0,0,0.114648232,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.408199361,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.049321617,0.026950322,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.064189752,0.121991835,0,0.070247971,0.048751443,0,0,0.105026175,0.128535789,0,0.396246191,0,0.077195583,0.08590551,0,0,0.444843288,0,0.217005039,0,1,,,1,1,1,1,,,,,5

On the basis of elaborating the mechanism of ER on technological innovation, the Super-SBM-Windows-DEA model is employed to measure the green innovation efficiency (GIE) using provincial-level panel data from 2004-2017 in China. The system generalised method of moments is used to estimate the direct effects of ER on GIE, an innovative mediating effect model that based on structural equation model is utilised to explore their indirect effects. Further, a spatial econometric model is developed to examine the possible spatial effects between ER and GIE. The 'U' shaped relationship between ER and GIE is verified in the direct effect test. The results of the indirect effects indicate that ER is not conducive to GIE by discouraging the inflows and outflows of FDI, while it contributes to GIE by promoting the structural upgrading of industry. The spatial effect results show that the impact of ER on GIE in neighbouring areas has an obvious spatial spillover characteristic, which is manifested as an inverted 'U'-shaped relationship of promotion followed by inhibition. The paper further proposes policy implications including strengthening cross-regional joint prevention and control, integrating ER strategies, and rational application of ER tools, so as to promote a win-win development of innovation and sustainability, and the positive effects of ER are better developed.",2022,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sd.2336,C7,3,2021,Journal,0.095527393,0.089891017,0,0.07371812,0.061841661,0.094644747,0,0,0.043734528,0.076598972,0,0.090429694,0,0.099204725,0,0,0,0.093237858,0.152776372,0,0,0,0.019839122,0,0.036187407,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.309800694,0,0,0,0.097030251,0.096341147,0,0.094063985,0,0.087469057,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06216675,0,0,0.066223277,0,0,0,0,0.083563071,0,0.214849393,0.059462097,0,0.27961209,0.614508258,0,0,0,0,0,0.033784767,0.110764053,0.090159705,0,0,0,0.08308655,0,0,0.053993219,0.087938553,0.167126142,0.041891298,0.048119091,0.166971021,0,0,0,0,0.076598972,0.049349873,0.343037206,0.158634385,0,0.05498756,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,1,2

Hierarchical regression analyses are conducted to test the research model based on the data collected from 270 manufacturing firms in China. The results suggest that knowledge breadth and depth affect knowledge sharing intention in opposite directions. Specifically, firms with a broad knowledge base are more likely to share their knowledge in interfirm cooperation, whereas firms with deep knowledge are reluctant to share.

Design/methodology/approach This is a qualitative interpretative study through the theoretical lens of social innovation. The organizational phenomenon studied was the business strategy for sustainable regional development of a Brazilian financial institution. Secondary data were collected from financial institution's documents. The data analysis followed a categorization technique. Findings This research presents five intersectional elements that act as agglutinating factors between the structural elements common to these organizations: the processes (inter-organizational and intra-organizational), the forms of materialization of social innovation (products, experiences and replicable forms) and the impacts (in society and organization). Practical implications The paper contributes to the debate about social innovation as to its definition, showing that it is both a phenomenon and a theory, which is still little explored. In particular, in emerging countries, such as Brazil, which publishes little about social innovation in international literature, going beyond European countries. Second, an empirical deeper understanding of the for-profit organizations modus operandi adopts and integrates social innovation in their strategies and operations. Third, given the multidimensional and complex nature of the social systems involved in innovation actions, it discusses a strategy that acts as an agglutinating factor. Finally, with reflections so that managers can discuss and start up a social innovation project. Originality/value Most research is based on nonempirical evidence. Among the few empirical works, the focus is on the performance of nonprofit organizations in the promotion, development and implementation of projects involving social technology.

Design/methodology/approach The authors carried out an innovation survey with Brazilian manufacturing firms. A sample of 1,156 firms was analyzed in this paper. Collected data were analyzed using multivariate data analysis techniques. From an innovation capabilities approach, it was possible to identify different types of organization of the firm. Findings Results show four different types of organization of the firm: advanced, intermediate and basic stability-oriented and change-oriented. Each type presents a different innovation capabilities arrangement. The successful strategies toward innovation are related to change-oriented organization of the firm and advanced stability-oriented organization of the firm. Research limitations/implications This study contributes to the literature by presenting a different view on the organization of the firm, encompassing the capabilities approach and thus a higher level on the perception of firms' heterogeneity. This study contributes to narrow the literature gap on how firms internally coordinate its different capabilities into a coherent organization to sustain an innovative behavior. Practical implications These straightforward findings can serve as a guideline so that managers can conduct changes within their companies toward more innovation. Managers can reconsider its organization as a way to foment innovation, once it is identified as a key strategy for competitiveness. Social implications This study may help managers understand that focusing on stability-driven capabilities is riskier if change-driven capabilities are not present in an adequate and aligned level of development. The outcome may be the growth of the cost structure greater than the potential return. Conversely, managers should also understand that once change-driven capabilities are in a glance, they need do follow up with stability-driven capabilities. Here, the risk is not having an adequate structure to sustain the upcoming growth, arising from innovation. In short, not only cost and value should be taken together, but they must be arranged following the specific situation of the company. Every company should manage costs either to sustain new added value or to allow the addition of new value. Originality/value The study is based on a unique dataset that traces a large set of companies, being able to check different types of firm organization and associate it with innovation capabilities. The study relates to an emerging economy, which has not received adequate attention until now, largely because of the lack of micro-level data. The study is based on a robust theoretical model of innovation capabilities, which is being tested through such data.

More specifically, we explore the firms' exit behavior in the context of the headquarters-foreign affiliate relationship. To this end, this study develops a model whereby the impact of performance on the firms' exit decision is moderated by innovation capability and international experience. Using secondary and primary data collected from multiple respondents from Chinese outward foreign direct investment firms, the findings indicate that innovation capability moderates the relationship between performance and exit decision. However, and contrary to expectations, the study suggests that incremental and radical innovation have an opposite contingent effect on the performance-exit relationship.

With task-oriented synergistic cooperation goal-oriented synergistic interaction as a mediating variable, the goal objective of this study was to fill the research gap between transformational leadership influence and organizational innovation. Data was collected through online electronic questionnaires using Likert Scales. This study used a census method, where the sample was all general insurance companies in Indonesia; hence, it can represent the general insurance industry. It involved 72 respondents, representing 72 general insurance companies that were actively operating in Indonesia in 2021. This research results offered crucial implications about the organizational interaction in the emerging market of the insurance industry, such as Indonesia. The survey responses were analyzed using Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) in Partial Least Square. This study found that transformational leadership positively influences organizational innovation. Then, the goal-oriented synergistic interaction has positively mediated transformational leadership influence and organizational innovation.

However, with the swift popularisation of the coworking model by 2020, newly established flexible office spaces have begun to refer to themselves as community-based workplaces even though they lacked the capacity to support their users' interactions and collaborative work. Therefore, the purpose of the paper is to explore how coworking spaces have transformed from community-based environments to a flexible place of work where establishing a collaborative community is not an organisational priority. The following exploratory research investigates a sample of 13 coworking spaces in Prague, the Czech Republic, and considers their capacity for supporting interactions and collaborative processes between their users. The results uncovered significant differences between coworking spaces, their spatial designs, the presence of mediation mechanisms, and the frequency of interactions between users, and suggest that the handful of sampled coworking environments misuse the notion of community. In that context, the following study indicates that contemporary coworking spaces can revert to community washing to deliberately pursue economic self-interest rather than support decentralised peer-to-peer exchange that would lead to developing a coworking community.",2021,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.18778/1231-1952.28.2.15,C6,4,2008,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.126253879,0,0.620730309,0.130527299,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.014318013,0,0,0,0,0.143651825,0.134943441,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.04635332,0.12027129,0,0,0,0,0.105828736,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.340065467,0.226080377,0,0,0.215143849,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.12671265,0,0,0.520550374,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.060466399,0.06945567,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.079369699,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,1,1,1,,1,,1,3

We integrate the well-established knowledge-based theory and the open innovation literature with consideration of the so-called knowledge relations spiral . How knowledge is created, transferred and diffused in an industrial district and how new knowledge and innovations are generated in the process are widely explored issues, we propose however an operational approach to the key concepts in the relevant literature and we test them on a case district: The Apulian Clothing Industrial District for the year 2012. To this end, we consider a multi-stage econometric model, based on a system of simultaneous equations spanning across 1) the influence of firms' relational choices on district innovative performance and 2) the influence of district firms' innovative effort and structural characteristics on their relational choices. Data are derived by administering a questionnaire to a selected sample of district firms. The results support the presence of a knowledge relations spiral at work within the district, generating a continuous exchange of tacit and codified knowledge both within and outside it. In this way an innovation process is created. Finally, the analysis suggests a more proactive role of the institutions to favor the reproduction of the industrial district over time.

We argue that climate change and institutions are latent explanatory variables that require attention in the literature on aquatic-based innovations. Our aim is to conduct an ex-ante analysis focusing on these two external forces in the context of aquaculture and the adoption of aquaponics technology in Colombia. We use an embedded case-study design incorporating a qualitative and exploratory approach and employ two categories of fish-farming production systems as units of analysis. We triangulate our findings using non-probability sampling techniques and use our findings as a benchmark to discuss the potential adoption of aquaponics technology. Our findings suggest that fluctuations in rainfall and drought are the most important climate variables influencing negatively fish farming activities. Furthermore, we find that the complex institutional structures involved create unequal informal mechanisms among fish-farming production systems. We argue for context-specific designs when considering the adoption of aquaponics and conclude that, while fish-farming production systems encounter these external forces differently, heterogeneity also exists within systems, revealing intricacies worth considering.

However, conventional approaches to academic research management limit our understanding of the way interdisciplinary research (IDR) centers integrate multiple disciplines. This paper proposes a multilevel approach to explore the patterns of knowledge integration and the forms of research organization emerging from the practices and activities of IDR centers. Several bibliometric-based, network-oriented and visualization-rich approaches are used. The cases of two prominent IDR centers are considered: Harvard University's Wyss Institute and Kyoto University's WPI-iCeMS. At the macro level, our results show similarities in the scientific positioning of both IDR centers, which translate into differences in the nature, intensity and drivers of their knowledge interconnections at the meso-level. At the micro-level, we demonstrate that far from idealizations of full convergence, the realities of IDR centers are characterized by heterogeneous patchworks of multi-trajectory research domains some of these enabling, others generating interdisciplinary knowledge. Differences in knowledge integration occur between but also, and more importantly,, within IDR centers. Thus, tailored strategies tuned to the particularities of organizations and topic-based forms of research organization appear to cope better with interdisciplinary knowledge. The understanding of these inter- and intra-organizational differences proves crucial for effectively fostering knowledge integration.

The authors propose a theoretical framework to illustrate the effect of relational capital on three dimensions of collaboration and radical and incremental innovation. Design/methodology/approach: The paper has a quantitative approach. The authors conducted the survey to collect the data from 225 suppliers in the Hunan province of China. The proposed model is tested with exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling. Findings: The findings show that relational capital can facilitate information sharing and benefit/risk sharing when firms work together to achieve innovation. Furthermore, the results indicate that relational capital leads to radical innovation through facilitating information sharing among firms and helps in generating incremental innovation by encouraging firms to share risks and benefits with their partners. Practical implications: The findings of this study give some suggestions for managers of the firms in terms of building their collaborative strategies. Managers should exploit relational capital to build successful and long-term collaboration. Also, through relational capital, managers can share information to create radical innovation or pool risks and share benefits with their customers to achieve incremental innovation. Originality/value: This study provides a nuanced understanding of the relationship between relational capital, different dimensions of SCC and innovation in the context of a developing economy. Moreover, the findings provide a clearer understanding of the collaborative mechanism of relational capital and collaboration to achieve radical and incremental innovation.

Accordingly, innovation helps micro-enterprises to bounce to achieve fundamental change in their businesses. Micro and small enterprises are exposed by different factors to innovating new products and services. This study, therefore, focused on exploring factors that determine the innovation of service and manufacturing MSEs: the role of entrepreneurial attitude towards innovation in Woldia city administration. The researchers used a cross-sectional research design and followed a quantitative approach. The data were collected by using a structured questionnaire. The collected data were analysed by using SPSS v-25 and Amos graphics to conduct descriptive, factor, correlation, regression and path analysis. The study finding revealed that government support, access to infrastructure, entrepreneurial training, entrepreneurial attitude and the leadership of the owners significantly affected the innovation of service and manufacturing MSEs. Entrepreneurial training and leadership of the owners directly and indirectly affected the innovation of services and manufacturing MSEs through the mediating variable of entrepreneurial attitude.

The review reveals that the business model concept has gained an increasing amount of attention in process-industrial research, but it also shows that the literature exhibits a lack of construct clarity and that it is developing in different domains, depending on the perspectives scholars have taken to study business models in process industries. Specifically, while innovation management scholars have explored the relationship between technological innovations and business models as well as the process and outcomes of business model innovation, scholars from the domain of production management have focused on value chain (re)configurations and taken a system-based perspective to consider boundary-spanning exchanges with key stakeholders in the design of business models. However, despite variance in the perspectives, the review further shows that works in these divergent domains point to a family of emerging themes and to common ideas that have not been explored together. This allows us to identify the particularities of business models in process industries and develop a definition of process-industrial business models, which extends prior business model literature into the process industry context. Furthermore, we synthesize these connections to develop an agenda for future, cross-disciplinary research on business models in process industries that assists cumulative theorizing and subsequent empirical progress.

An overview of the theoretical background and state-of-the-art for quantum technologies and manufacturing systems is presented. Fields of application for quantum technologies are explored in the context of relevant manufacturing systems domains. Potential applications are proposed based on an analysis and synthesis of relevant literature, industrial case studies, as well as the authors' ideations. A case is laid out for how quantum technologies can potentially facilitate industrial symbiosis within limited global ecological boundaries. In other words, the case study describes how Sustainable Development can be potentially facilitated using quantum computing and quantum AI. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2022 The Authors.

The current research will employ qualitative research methods to investigate two questions: (a) Is the path for the development of radically innovative qualitative different from the development of incrementally innovative products in industries with high technological turbulence such as the Pharma-Biotech industry? (b) Are there any systematic differences in the governance structures employed in the management of interfirm relationships in the development of radical innovations and incremental innovations? This research uses Thomson ReutersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s product Cortellis Competitive Intelligence as its primary data source. This resource is the industry standard for all drug development and pipeline activity information in the Pharma-Biotech industry. After securing the rights to use the database, we narrowed our search using the following process: We designated the innovativeness of the products based on the type of FDA review these drugs received (c.f. Sorescu et al. 2003; Aboulnasr et al. 2008). New-to-the-world molecules or biological entities that received a priority review (this included statuses such as Accelerated Approval and Fast Track statuses) were classified as radical innovations. Already existing molecules or biological entities that were repurposed and received a standard review were classified as incremental innovations. This resulted in the classification of 139 products as radical innovations, 390 as technological breakthroughs, 10 as market breakthroughs, and 113 as incremental innovations. Next, all the development histories (qualitative) data on the development of radical and incremental innovations were gleaned. Given the exploratory goals of this research and the thinly developed state of knowledge in exploring the path dependencies in product development and innovation outcomes, a grounded theory approach seemed appropriate to analyze the data. One theme in path dependency that has emerged early is the involvement of universities in the discovery of radically innovative (as opposed to incrementally innovative) products. Universities were involved in 40 discoveries as opposed to the 9 for incrementally innovative products. There also appear to be more firms involved in the discovery and development of radical innovations. For instance, quantitatively speaking, the average number of entities involved in the development of incremental products was 3.3 and 12.8 for radical products. There also appear to be more complex deal structures and more milestones and payments in the development of radical innovations as opposed to incremental products. For instance, radical drugs appear to be first licensed and then acquired more often than incremental innovations which are most often licensed. In other words, radical (incremental) innovations appear to be the product of more (fewer) interfirm partnerships that combine market rules and hierarchical governance in that order.

The study of smart cities from the perspective of humanism provides an effec-tive theoretical tool for geographiers in this field. Different from the perspective of technocentrism that regards smart cities as a collection of physical spaces composed of a communication infrastructure network and digital technology, the humanism perspective emphasizes the interaction of technology, humanistic governance (soci-ety), and space in a specific (local) context. It calls for a micro-survey of the local cooperation mechanism of information and communication technology (ICT) innovation and smart city construction, as well as governance decision making carried out by multiple actors, with a view to revealing the construction process and localized driving mechanism of smart cities, and with an emphasis on the data analysis of individual actions to find out a development path consistent with local conditions. This study examined the latest developments in humanistic research on smart cities, arguing that current studies still follow the technocentric perspective or adopt the oppo-site knowledge-centric position, but lack a technology-society synergy perspective. On this basis, this article pro-poses future research topics that are worthy of in-depth discussion, namely, the symbiosis of technology and soci-ety, the complexity of social interactions on technology innovation, and the contextual analysis of technology innovation and interactions. Our discussion may help to understand how smart cities, as a complex human-environ-ment system, undergo transformation in the continuous interaction of people and technology, and provide some theoretical references for the study of smart cities in China.

We use a Delphi study to examine the direction of influence, effectiveness, and ease of implementation of 34 IT governance practices in the oil and gas industry. We find that relational mechanisms are perceived as more effective and easier to implement than structures and processes, and we identify a minimum baseline of IT governance practices to foster continuous digital innovation.

This research emphasizes strategic alignment between the innovation and the organization as the key factor shaping these decisions. In contrast, organizational research suggests that to access resources, product innovations have to be perceived as legitimate by corporate sponsors. Legitimacy is rooted in alignment with the prevalent corporate norms, beliefs, and cultural model. Adopting an institutional perspective and relying on an in-depth case study of three product innovations, this study explores legitimacy-seeking behavior in product innovation. The findings indicate that the rational perspective emphasized in most product innovation research is complemented by efforts to seek both moral and cognitive legitimacy to resource product innovation. The study clarifies the critical role that the organizational context plays in triggering legitimacy-seeking behavior. The analysis unpacks legitimacy-seeking behavior, revealing patterns of legitimating mechanisms (lobbying, relationship building, and gathering feedback) that are deployed as part of legitimacy strategies (conforming, selecting, and manipulating) to achieve a range of legitimacy outcomes (pragmatic, moral, and cognitive). The analysis reveals the existence of a hierarchy of legitimacy outcomes as actors prioritize one type of legitimacy versus another. The study also finds interdependencies between mechanisms and strategies to reinforce particular outcomes as legitimacy-seeking behavior evolves over time.

A total of 1002 industrial cluster research studies collected from the Web of Science between 1998 to 2019 were used as samples. BibExcel software was used for data cleaning and literature co-citation analysis, and co-occurrence matrix was inserted into SPSS software and Pajek software for exploratory factor analysis and network analysis, respectively. The differences and commonalities of the two results obtained from exploratory factor analysis and network analysis were compared by reading literature abstracts and manuscripts to robustly identify the knowledge base. According to the framework of 2W1H, the knowledge module was integrated into a problem-oriented system to understand the internal logic mechanism of the entire study. The top 41 studies in the citation frequency of each period from 1998 to 2005, 2006 to 2012, and 2013 to 2019 were selected to analyze the keyword co-occurrence in different periods, main theoretical basis, contextual focus, evolution of research topics, and important research trends. The results show that: 1) The knowledge base of industrial clusters can be divided into nine modules: external economics and new economic geography, new industrial district theory, competitive advantage theory, evolutionary economic geography, buzz and pipelines, regional innovation system, new economic sociology, absorptive capacity, and global chains; 2) The knowledge structure of these modules can be reflected through the 2W1H research framework, in which the WHAT part is composed of four modules: external economics, new economic geography, new industrial district theory, competitive advantage theory, and evolutionary economic geography. It answers the questions regarding concept, types and development stages of the cluster. The knowledge base of cluster type research in this part is less, which reflects the lack of corresponding research literature, and therefore this needs to be enriched using typology theory. The part WHY is composed of external economics and this is divided into two modules, i. e., new economic geography and competitive advantage theory, which answer the questions about the causes of cluster and its impact on regional or enterprise competitive advantage. In the 21st century, researchers have paid increasing attention to the causes of urban cultural and creative industry cluster formation. The part HOW is composed of five modules: buzz and pipelines, regional innovation system, new economic sociology, absorptive capacity, and global chains. This part is the most important, and can be categorized into three levels: enterprise, region, and country; 3) Between 1998-2019, the regional innovation system had been the main theoretical source of cluster. Evolutionary economic geography had occupied a significant position between 2006 and 2012 and it tended to blend with the global chain. The important theoretical sources of the three periods were constantly updated and enriched, thereby increasing the degree of integration with management theory. The focused industries of the three periods were more diverse, especially the status of the service industry, and the focus regions were later transferred to emerging markets and underdeveloped markets; innovation and local economic development had always been the core topics of the three periods. From 2006 to 2012, globalization and entrepreneurial activities received more attention. From 2013 to 2019, management theory occupied the main position, as it focused on new topics such as environmental governance and stakeholder management, and paid more attention to social, ecological, and other issues. Finally, based on the results, some suggestions for domestic research were presented. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2020 Tropical Geography.

A conceptual model is developed and tested through path analysis using the cross-section data collected from the automotive industry in Iran. Using a quantitative methodology, 280 of 500 senior and executive managers in the automotive industry in Iran participated and completed the survey. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used for data reduction of the entire sample (to purify the scale) and to ascertain whether the survey questions were loaded on their respective dimensions (this was refined and confirmed later by CFA). Besides that, the structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine the research hypotheses and hypothesised model. Leadership, customer focus, education and training, strategic supplierÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s partnership, information analysis, internal lean practices and teamwork is positively associated with organisational performance. The results of this study provide strong evidence that certain supply chain quality management practices when implemented can directly or indirectly improve innovation and performance.

Interviewed are the human resource managers of two of Turkey's leading business groups: a manager from the HR department of one of Turkey's largest banks and the deputy general manager of a non-governmental organization. The evidence suggests that these firms exercise carefully honed policies aimed at fostering gender equality and to that end engage in a variety of activities targeting various human resource functions. Their motives appear to be to reinforce their corporate image, enhance employee satisfaction, and reap such anticipated rewards as greater productivity and increased innovation capability. The importance of company leadership is underlined as an antecedent to the adoption of gender-equality focussed diversity management. The study may have important implications for building sustainable corporate brands, especially in the emerging-market context.

Among the forms of scholarship - i.e., discovery, teaching and learning, integration, and application - the scholarship of integration emphasizes bringing together otherwise isolated knowledge by making generative connections within and across different perspectives and disciplines. These connections lead to new insights and language, and place specialized knowledge in a broader context, often revealing patterns that can be useful to specialists and non-specialists. Some argue that this form of scholarship is becoming more central to academic work because it is better equipped for building interdisciplinary partnerships, developing frameworks that transcend disciplinary paradigms, and responding to complex issues at the individual and societal level. For engineering education, this type of scholarship can provide a mechanism for scholars to create new language, theorize and develop conceptual frameworks, and make cross-disciplinary translations for use in discovery, teaching, and practice. Yet, although valuable, the scholarship of integration is relatively underdeveloped and under-theorized. In this paper, we unpack four scholarship of integration cases - focused on systems thinking, innovation, design teaching and learning, and reflection - with a goal of enhancing our collective understanding of this form of scholarship and ways to use it in engineering education. We employ a process of collaborative inquiry to reflect upon, analyze, and highlight common strategies and challenges in each of and across our cases. First, we provide individual accounts of our experiences, lessons learned, and scholarship of integration features, revealed through our collaborative process, that are embedded in our cases. We then highlight a common strategy and three common challenges that emerged through the collaborative inquiry process. We conclude with a question about the implications of this exploration for individual researchers, the community, and policy makers that warrant further conversation.

The primary trade market, which is mainly resource intensive and labor-intensive, has gradually shrunk, while the technology trade characterized by high added value has become one of the trade with the fastest growth in Global trade volume and the strongest development potential. Global technology trade will become the carrier of advanced technology and innovative technology in various countries and regions, and will launch fierce competition in the international market, promoting the evolution and reconstruction of global economy and science and technology system. With the rise of network science, complex network and social network analysis methods have been widely introduced into the field of international trade research. Global trade network research has become a hot spot and frontier, presenting the research context from network nature to spatial evolution simulation, from overall trade network to intra industry or intra product network, from formation mechanism to influencing factors. Therefore, based on the construction of technology trade network based on spatial connection, this paper attempts to analyze the topological elements such as the total scale of trade, network nodes and associations, and network communities, so as to explore the spatial characteristics of global technology trade network.

Higher educational institutes (HEIs) are compelled to adopt digital technologies and technology-mediated learning in the teaching-learning processes. The purpose of this paper is to understand the factors affecting learning effectiveness, learning satisfaction and the mediating role of prerecorded videos from the learnersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ perspective. Design/methodology/approach: A self-designed structured questionnaire based on previous similar studies is adopted as a survey instrument. It consists of 22 questions to address the five constructs of the proposed hypothesized conceptual model, developed for the study. Data of 311 students from HEIs of Maharashtra state in India were collected. Confirmatory factor analysis is carried out to test the model fitness, reliability and validity, and structural equation modeling is applied to conduct path analysis and hypotheses testing of the model. Findings: Hypotheses testing reveals that perceived usefulness (PU) significantly affects the perceived learning effectiveness, which again affects the learning satisfaction of the students. In addition, perceived ease of use affects the PU as suggested in the technology acceptance model. The prerecorded videos have a moderating role to play in the computer self-efficacy and the perceived learning effectiveness of the students. This research will provide meaningful acumen to enhance the overall learning process among students in urban as well as rural India. Originality/value: This study explores the technology-mediated learning during the unexpected and dynamic situations of the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of higher education in India. For sustainable use of technology-assisted learning, educators must understand the key factors that influence studentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ learning effectiveness and satisfaction. The research outcomes will lead toward developing the human capacities, as the prerecorded videos at the HEIs of India will provide new approaches for effectively adopting digital technologies and technology-mediated learning.

Drawn from an in-depth case study in a German medium size engineering company in the equestrian sports industry, we explore both internal and external barriers to business model innovation. BMI is defined as any change in one or more of the nine building blocks of the Business Model Canvas; customer segment, value propositions, channels, customer relation, revenue streams, key resources, key activities, key partners, cost structure [1]. Our results show that barriers to business model innovation can be overcome by the deployment of organisational learning mechanisms and the development of an open network capability.",2017,Conference Paper,,C17,2,2021,Journal,0,0.116632436,0.125501285,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.351994088,0,0,0,0.09284118,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.038611508,0,0.140858084,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1258955,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.061292121,0,0,0.203790548,0.711285042,0,0,0.193393422,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.227804727,0.1315059,0.023952488,0,0,0,0,0,0.181245589,0,0,0,0.108422007,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.114238041,0,0.032015412,0,0.27443476,0,0,0.092591306,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,6

The authors draw distinctions and explore potential interdependencies between these two dynamic capability reservoirs, by integrating concepts from the theoretical perspectives they are derived from, but which have until now largely ignored each other - the social network perspective and the dynamic capabilities view. Design/methodology/approach The authors investigate nanotechnology-driven R&D activities in the 1995-2005 period for 76 publicly traded firms in the electronics and electrical equipment industry and in the chemicals and pharmaceuticals industry, that applied for 580 nanotechnology-related patents and engaged in 2,459 alliances during the observation period. The authors used zero-truncated Poisson regression as the estimation method. Findings The findings support conceptualizing dynamic capabilities as four distinct subsets, deployed for sensing or seizing purposes, and across the two different inter-organizational contexts. The findings also suggest potential synergies between these subsets of dynamic capabilities, with two subsets being more macro-oriented (i.e. sensing and seizing opportunities within networks) and the two other ones more micro-oriented (i.e. sensing and seizing opportunities within specific alliances). Practical implications - The authors show that firms differ in their subsets of dynamic capabilities for pursuing different types of inter-organizational, boundary-spanning relationships (such as alliances vs broader network relationships), which ultimately affects their innovation performance. Originality/value The authors contribute to the growing body of work on dynamic capabilities and firm-specific advantages by unbundling the dynamic capability subsets, and investigating their complex interdependencies for managing different types of inter-organizational linkages. The main new insight is that the linear model of generating more innovations through higher inter-firm collaboration in an emerging field paints an erroneous picture of how high innovation performance is actually achieved.",2019,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/CCSM-02-2019-0044,C8,4,2019,Journal,0.26351035,0,0,0,0.17058895,0,0,0,0.241281594,0.211296688,0,0.249448452,0,0,0,0.394763822,0,0.257194715,0,0,0,0,0.054725811,0,0.099822219,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.384300737,0,0,0.044292512,0,0,0,0.241281594,0,0,0,0.1793269,0,0,0,0,0,0.216631068,0.216029139,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.093194585,0.101846787,0,0,0.141731802,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.242871998,0,0.068065305,0,0,0,0.151682052,0,0,0,0.20501857,0,1,,,1,,,1,,,,,8

Design/methodology/approach The authors used Mplus and SPSS to test the proposed model with data from 286 leader-employee dyads in Chinese companies. In this study, questionnaires were collected through commission and field investigation. Findings The results indicate that authoritarian leadership can positively influence perceived insider status and EIB within a certain range in Chinese organizational culture, although this is counterintuitive. In addition, perceived insider status has a high level of explanatory power on EIB and can mediate the relationship between authoritarian leadership and EIB. Furthermore, proactive personality can moderate the positive influence of authoritarian leadership on perceived insider status. Originality/value Innovation management is inseparable from the specific organizational cultural context.

From a long-term perspective, however, it is still not clear how social innovation contributes towards filling institutional voids. This paper aims to understand which institutional factors have influenced social innovation and how a coffee production initiative has transformed the reality in which it operates. We analysed a joint initiative of social enterprises that coordinate an organic coffee value chain in southern Mexico, a region in which extreme poverty affects 75% of the population. The case study involved thirteen semi-structured interviews with key actors and participant observation in situ, complemented by secondary data, in an interpretative perspective that adopted a qualitative and exploratory approach. The main results indicate that social innovation fills institutional voids by creating a 'self-revolving system of activity expansion'. This system helps to scale social innovation based on the collaboration of different actors and the integration of the coffee production chain that promotes the social and economic development of the community by: (1) establishing a more productive relationship between small local producers; (2) adding value to the coffee; (3) encouraging social and economic empowerment in the cooperative; and (4) organizing local economic activities.",2020,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02692171.2019.1638351,C4,6,2017,Conference Paper,0.159119067,0,0.080558138,0.061395784,0,0,0,0,0.036424093,0,0.07163198,0,0.069794818,0,0,0.119187825,0,0.038826353,0.063619536,0,0,0,0.016522918,0,0.030138509,0,0.069001067,0,0.077862043,0,0,0,0,0.082097505,0,0,0.161622362,0.013372877,0,0,0,0.291392745,0,0.427440493,0.067074096,0,0,0.075419738,0.078685715,0,0,0.588650881,0.326119591,0,0.062751598,0,0,0,0.069595105,0,0.044734073,0,0.198419377,0,0.073112895,0,0.081578692,0,0,0.073112895,0.225099856,0,0.07508908,0,0,0,0,0.116339902,0.062579941,0,0,0,0.034888967,0,0.027812203,0,0,0,0,0,0.020550403,0,0.088078593,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,1,,,1,,,,,8

However, no in-depth exploration has been made on how agricultural clusters form and evolve, especially in the context of China's long-term small-scale rural economy. The purpose of this article is to reveal the formation process and evolution mechanism of agricultural clusters by case study research. With the knowledge flow as the starting point, this article takes the Vegetable Cluster in Shouguang City of Shandong Province, China as an example to construct a theoretical framework in the three dimensions of points (spin-offs of enterprises or farmers), lines (network-spillovers of various innovation) and planes (the formation of new regional industry spaces) and put forward theoretical hypotheses. It is shown that: (1) The local spin-off of seed farmers is the main path in the transformation of traditional farmers into enterprises. (2) The network-spillover and adoption of innovative knowledge promote the derivation of specialized farmers or enterprises and realize regional agricultural specialization and spatial agglomeration. (3) The formation of the agricultural cluster resulted from the joint effects of spin-off derived from the entrepreneurial spirit of the farmers, network-spillover of various agricultural innovations and spatial integration of the agricultural landscape. The formation of local agricultural innovation systems marks the maturity of an agricultural cluster. This article contribute to the field by studying one source of Alfred Marshall's knowledge of external economy from the perspective of spin-offs and innovative spillovers, analyzing the agricultural increasing returns to scale neglected by Krugman, and exploring the micro mechanism of farmers' enterprise-oriented evolution and the formation of agricultural clusters in underdeveloped rural areas.

Consequently, as firms launch new product development (NPD), it has become more critical to determine a method by which to integrate technology and knowledge together and to enhance absorptive capability (AC) of firms in the process of information, technology and knowledge sharing. This study thus combines the concepts of corporate social capital (CSC), intellectual capital, and AC, and discusses the influence of internal/external resource integration on technology integration mechanisms (TIM) and knowledge integration mechanisms (KIM), as well as AC's effect on NPD. Three hundred and ninety-four valid responses were collected and partial least squares structural equation modeling was adopted for data analysis. The results show that interaction ties and the shared language of CSC positively affect TIM, while human capital and organizational capital have positive influences on KIM. In addition, TIM and KIM both have significant and positive influences on AC and AC further influences NPD performance. Therefore, this study suggests that firms have to establish interaction bases for utilizing external knowledge to assist in NPD, and this can be achieved by offering a friendly environment to encourage employees to be more willing to contribute their knowledge.",2016,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10796-016-9629-y,C7,3,2019,Journal,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.365058359,0,0,0.140355921,0,0.101236234,0,0.065956967,0,0,0,0,0.014034303,0,0,0.233766557,0.117216807,0.281610756,0,0,0.104581447,0,0,0,0.098553001,0,0,0,0,0,0.229174497,0,0,0.10373175,0,0.091975906,0,0.064060321,0,0,0,0.444436137,0.221600616,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.075992813,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.382392442,0.026118364,0,0,0,0,0,0.098817254,0.106308803,0,0.31104105,0.11822594,0,0,0,0,0.127178787,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.201927532,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,7

Against this background, this study employs knowledge coupling theory to investigate antecedents of BIM integration intention (BII). This study surveys 167 managers in the Chinese construction industry and analyzes the data using the structural equation modeling technique. The results indicate that three types of knowledge inertia (i.e., routine problem-solving strategy) exert different effects on BII. Specifically, experience inertia positively affects BII, learning inertia negatively affects BII, and procedural inertia has no effect on BII. Moreover, both formal and informal knowledge governance are positively related to BII. Further, formal knowledge governance is found to weaken the negative link between learning inertia and BII but strengthen the positive link between experience inertia and BII. These findings contribute to the construction management literature by deepening our understanding of BIM integration.

Furthermore, while scholars have accumulated knowledge about innovative behavior in business contexts where innovation is nurtured, to fully understand 'innovation by employees' we need to also address business contexts where innovation by employees is not overtly expected. For these reasons, the aim of this paper is to explore the bottom-up emergence of so-called employee-driven innovation (EDI) in a formalized business context and study how HRM support mechanisms contribute to this. We conducted an explorative single case study in a highly formalized company - a medical laboratory in the Netherlands. The data analysis was based on 40 interviews, documents, and observations. We found that a highly formalized business context does support innovation by employees, but that this has specific employee-driven innovation routes through which employees innovate. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the content and process of EDI emergence should be studied using a multilevel perspective. We offer recommendations on how EDI routes should be modelled and reflect on what this contributes to the HRM - innovation literature.

The transmission of knowledge, sharing of resources, and facilitation of learning through contagion has interested both business-to-business and economic geography researchers. This study responds to calls in both research traditions for research into knowledge and learning at the level of an interfirm network. More specifically, it focuses on developing an understanding of how the contagion of knowledge and ideas and the co-ordination of activities within a network tales place. We achieve this by drawing upon research in both network relationships dynamics and learning processes to investigate the causal mechanisms that drive contagion. We focus on two types of contagion: contagion by cohesion (i.e. the presences and closeness of direct contact with others in the network), and contagion by structural equivalence (i.e. where influence is related to the structural patterns of relationships in the network). We also identify two key mechanisms that act as a barrier to such contagion: isolation and immunity. We explore the implications of these findings for network learning opportunities, specifically learning-by doing, learning-by-using, and learning-by-interacting. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Our main objective is to perform a systematic literature review to better understand the associations between leadership and innovation/creativity, analyzing the knowledge thus far developed that addresses the mechanisms through which the two phenomena are connected. Theoretical framework - We present and analyze conceptual definitions for the three constructs involved in our review - leadership, creativity, and innovation. We also briefly highlight the main leadership theories and perspectives, their key conceptual elements, and their interface with creativity/innovation. Design/methodology/approach - We applied a combination of systematic and narrative review methodologies together with bibliometrics, and the review is unprecedented in its focus, depth, and breadth. We examined a sample of 2,724 published articles on the L-C/I relationships, analyzing 113 papers in depth published in the top 27 management journals. Findings - We observed an accelerated growth of research on the topic. Most studies address the effects of leadership on creativity, while its connections with innovation still need to be better understood. Transformational leadership is the main perspective adopted by researchers, but there has also been an emergence of studies applying the LMX, entrepreneurial, and positive leadership approaches. While some mediators and moderators have been explored, there remains the need to build comprehensive frameworks that are able to address the complexity of the issue. Transversal study designs predominate, and the few experimental studies mostly rely on student samples. Practical & social implications of the research - We discuss the possibilities and limitations of the present knowledge, synthesize existing gaps in the research, and offer direction to further expand the knowledge boundaries. We also contribute to fostering more systematic studies, which could avoid redundancies and unbridled construct proliferation, as well as to promoting the theoretical and methodological robustness that the field deserves. Originality/value - The study applies a combination of systematic and narrative review methodologies together with bibliometrics, and it is unique in its focus, depth, and breadth, therefore making a distinguished contribution and consolidating the research with varied approaches, while also identifying gaps to inspire future research that could bring momentum to the field.",2022,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.7819/rbgn.v24i1.4151,C1,6,2022,Journal,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.129012099,0.146558549,0,0,0,0,0,0.157758837,0.020317301,0,0.074119252,0,0.169693443,0.20384235,0.191485128,0.138917379,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.198737908,0.197326482,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.164954469,0.133152476,0,0.1854788,0.096755388,0.17514403,0,0,0.16040435,0,0,0,0.137814058,0.110013935,0,0,0.110013935,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.198737908,0,0,0.17017834,0,0.15390205,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.102518637,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.48210118,0.450503319,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,,1,10

Then later one has subsequent influence on organisational innovation; moreover, the model also considers the moderating role of employee perspective-taking between HPWS and employee engagement.

On this purpose, the framework involves and integrates structural holes (SH), alliance functional diversity (AFD) and alliance partner geographical diversity (APGD) that measure network characteristics from structural, relational and nodal perspectives, respectively. Design/methodology/approach The authors collected multi-source matching panel data including alliance deals, technical patents and financial information during 2000-2017 of the 106 top high-tech firms in the computer, communications, electronics and biopharmaceutical industries and conducted a three-way interaction model to uncover the complex mechanisms from a contingency perspective. Findings Empirical results show that SH as structural capital is positive to both exploitative and exploratory innovation. Both AFD as relational capital and APGD as cognitive capital positively moderate the SH-exploitative innovation nexus rather than the SH-exploratory innovation nexus. APGD and AFD co-moderate the relationship between SH and firm ambidextrous innovation in the way that when APGD and AFD are both high, SH has the strongest positive impacts on firm exploitative and exploratory innovation. Originality/value This research provides new insights into the benefit-cost paradox of the structural brokerage position (SH) by uncovering relational (AFD) and nodal (APGD) network characteristics that impact the trade-off. Also, it contributes to social capital theory by differentiating three dimensions of network capital (structural, relational and cognitive capital) and integrating them into ambidextrous innovation research.

To enrich this knowledge area guided by the Institutional Theory, this study builds a multiple mediation model to investigate the effect of environmental regulation on business sustainability by concerning on the chain mediation effect of green organizational identity and sustainable exploration/exploitation innovations. China's manufacturers that are a key component of emerging markets have been analyzed by this study because of their significant impacts on climate change, substantial contributions to the boom of industries, and distinctive governance structures. By investigating China's manufacturers such as shipbuilding, energy, food, and daily necessities manufacturing sectors, we witness that the relationship between environmental regulation and business sustainability could be positively subsequently mediated by green organizational identity and sustainable innovation. While this identity does not exercise a positive mediation between environmental regulation and business sustainability significantly. Furthermore, both sustainable exploration/exploitation innovations exercise a significantly positive mediation between green organizational identity and business sustainability. We therefore conclude that manufacturers of emerging markets need a thoughtful deployment in pro-environmental psychologies and behaviors to closely bridge environmental regulation and business sustainability instead of only concerning on one aspect.

Design/methodology/approach - The research had a quantitative and descriptive focus and used as methodology the validated and international approach known as Innovation Radar. Findings - The degree of innovation in these micro and small companies is low; thus, the authors could not characterize them as systemic innovators. Most of them are little innovative, although some were classified as occasional innovators. The dimensions organization, processes, presence, supply chain and added value were the least developed. Research limitations/implications - To carry out similar studies in other Brazilian regions, to compare results and draw new conclusions, or even check if the degree of innovation present in micro-firms of these regions would not be even lower; to monitor the evolution of companies through a longitudinal study, to detect improvements in the degree of innovation; and to conduct a qualitative research that can deepen questions on the results of our study, such as the reasons why this type of company does not adopt innovative practices, or even the real suitability of the Innovation Radar model for micro and small enterprises (MSEs). We observed that some dimensions proved to be too sophisticated for these companies, such as R&D investments and the adoption of technological advances. Practical implications - The study shows that the degree of innovation measured by the Innovation Radar is a useful and initial measure to check an innovative attitude in micro and small companies. It can also drive the actions that should be prioritized to stimulate the culture of innovation in SME. However, it does not allow to answer why this type of organization does not adopt innovative practices as a management attitude. Regarding its contribution, the authors expect that the paper may bring an awareness of managers and owners of micro and small companies for the need to foster innovative practices that can help increase the competitiveness and survival of this type of organization. Social implications - In Brazil, despite the fact that MSEs represent 98 per cent of the existing companies, and aremainly responsible for job creation, their leaders have a low concern for innovative practices. Originality/value - The study contributes to identify the degree of innovation of these firms, which comprise a representative and strategic segment of the city's economy, by checking to what extent an innovative attitude is effectively present in this sector. The theoretical contribution of this study regards the appropriateness of mechanisms or methodologies created to measure the degree of innovation in large organizations. Dimensions such as technological platform, brand, innovative ambience, degree of organization or systematization of processes, which are frequently considered for companies in general, and especially for large ones, are not sufficient or, instead, too sophisticated to allow an effective measurement of the degree of innovation in MSE. Thus, this study provides information for designing more effective ways to evaluate the degree of innovation that take into account MSE's specificities, which can be considered innovation efforts, such as simple process improvements, professional development of teams, and actions to seize ideas and opportunities, among others.",2019,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/INMR-03-2019-0031,C11,5,2022,Article,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.067093107,0,0.461810879,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.035759032,0,0,0.061256805,0.118160846,0.007608796,0.061601686,0.027757537,0,0,0,0,0.104048657,0,0.075852651,0,0.07561172,0,0.061428898,0,0.147796882,0,0.144303489,0.06212428,0.436105195,0,0,0.123550351,0.049865382,0.074896968,0.034730752,0,0.196773448,0.047684982,0,0,0.050796539,0,0,0,0.041200036,0,0,0.123600109,0.045610379,0,0,0.538695231,0.034546419,0.075133894,0.05973836,0.070842508,0,0.025914593,0.084961525,0,0,0.039411323,0,0,0,0.057636063,0.041415478,0.101179851,0,0,0.03690973,0.025615012,0,0,0.110365829,0,0,0.018926901,0,0,0.180546094,0.168712747,0,0,0,0,0.051748424,1,,,,,,,,,,1,10

A debate about whether a smart city is a pragmatic solution for modern challenges or just a technology-led urban utopia is entangled with the vexed issue of governance. While 'smart governance' has drawn unprecedented interest, the combination of its conceptual vagueness and broad applications couple with a lack of focus on its underlying international and local political paradigms have raised concerns about its utility. This study contributes to restoring attention to the original concept of governance, its differences with governing and government, and the potential challenges resulting from its functionality in its real, multi-layered, and complex contexts.

From the empirical side, we examine which actors, processes, and relational mechanisms at different levels that have had an impact on the initiation of smart cities in three Norwegian cities: Trondheim, Bergen, and Bodo.

Design/methodology/approach - Based on the dynamic capabilities theory and the relational view, this paper examines how TKIC, a special case of dynamic capability, influences business performance. The research context is the Brazilian automobile industry, in which firms are currently experimenting with modular production and increasing their interactions with suppliers. Using a sample of automobile suppliers, this investigates how relational resources, such as the buyer's trust in its suppliers and the level of supplier involvement, affect the level of TKIC, which, in turn, is hypothesized to affect business performance. In addition, this paper examines the moderating effect of various communication media on the TKIC-business performance relationship. The findings confirm the importance of relational resources and TKIC on business performance. Finally, this paper explores various theoretical and managerial implications to encourage future research. Findings - The results suggested that the two relational resources (supplier involvement and buyer's trust) are important drivers of TKICs and that the level of supplier involvement in the production process mediates the relationship between buyer's trust and TKIC. Moreover, this study found that TKIC leads to superior firm performance, but the degree of media naturalness does not seem to facilitate knowledge transfer. The results confirm that supplier involvement is a pivotal process in that the buying firm's internal resources and the major suppliers' resources and capabilities are combined to achieve a competitive advantage - TKIC. Research limitations/implications - This study is subject to the typical limitations inherent in cross-sectional research designs using subjective measures. That said, this still has some important implications indicating that relational resources, such as buyer's trust and supplier involvement, are critical in developing TKIC that seize opportunities from interfirm relationships and integrate knowledge across and within firm boundaries. Moreover, while knowledge management tools can resemble face-to-face interactions to the largest extent, the research suggested that it cannot substitute face-to-face communications in transferring tacit knowledge. Practical implications - Managers deal with complex interactions and linkages due to tacit knowledge from components, systems and modules, which are critical in developing organizational capabilities. Relational resources are important strategic assets facilitating resource combination and coordination. Managers must coordinate among multiple sources of learning and partner with their suppliers at an earlier stage to develop the relational capabilities and efficiently steer the process of boundary redefinition. Finally, managers must have the ability to manage tacit knowledge within the interface with suppliers using organizational mechanisms (i.e. TKIC) to help them absorb external knowledge from their supplier network and integrate it with specific internal competences. Social implications - Recent disruptive technological developments pressure organizations to become more flexible by requiring firms to adapt quickly to constantly changing markets and to have the ability to apply different resources and capabilities to specific unique situations. All this with a huge impact on the firm's employees and society in general. Thus, interfirm relationships and the role of knowledge integration is especially crucial, given the current industry trend in favor of experimenting with innovative production methods (e.g. flexible manufacturing and modular production) that can help managers to rethink work conditions in a more meaningful and flexible for society. Originality/value - While prior research treats integrative capability mainly as a mechanism that explains superior firms' performance in an interfirm relationship, few research efforts have explicated what shapes TKICs. By examining the relationship between relational resources, TKIC and performance, this study fills this research gap and develops and tests a theoretical framework.",2022,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JKM-07-2020-0501,C7,9,2017,Journal,0.098188253,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.089905456,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.220643155,0,0.047917472,0,0,0,0,0.020391729,0,0,0,0.08515754,0,0,0,0.075978002,0,0,0,0,0,0.099732972,0,0.599516754,0,0,0.359621824,0,0,0.082779373,0,0,0.186158264,0,0,0,0.322881071,0.080495979,0,0,0,0.069159456,0.055208474,0,0.171290501,0,0,0.081626304,0.095800174,0,0.046292559,0,0,0,0.090232146,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.154465839,0,0.18077606,0.085890671,0,0,0,0.051447097,0,0,0.361992264,0,0.025362242,0,0,0,0,0.073349771,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,1,1,,,,,10

To achieve the purpose, a quantitative study was conducted on 217 virtual team members. The data analysis was conducted via the structural equation modelling method. The empirical study revealed that customer, competitor and supplier coordination have a significant impact on exploitation innovation. The results also confirm that customer coordination has an effect on exploration innovation. By the way, the coordination effect with competitors and suppliers on exploration innovation is not significant. The e-leadership moderation is confirmed on verified links. The research path revealed a scarcity of research done on the relations between the variables study. The mediating effects of the e-leadership on the dependent and independent variables have never been explored earlier.

This article focuses on the required patterns of learning in order to cope with these changes, and what automotive managers can learn from the aerospace industry in this context. As organizational learning is the central parameter of economic evolution, and technology develops over trajectory shifts, companies are, at the very least, cyclically forced to learn ambidextrously, or are squeezed out of the market. They have to act and react as complex adaptive systems in their changing environment. Especially in these dynamics, ambidextrous learning is identified to be a conditio sine qua non for organizational success. Especially the combination of efficiency-oriented internal exploitation with an explorative and external-oriented open innovation network turns out to be a superior strategy. By combining patent data, patent citation analysis and data on the European Framework Programs, we show that there are temporal differences, i.e., position of the product in the product, technique, technology, and industry life cycle. Furthermore, we draw a conclusion dependent on the systemic product character, which enforces different learning requirements concerning supply chain position and, as an overarching conclusion, we identify product structure to be decisive for how organizational learning should be styled.

This study aims to fill this gap, evaluating the relationship between an international ambidexterity strategy and CS in EMNEs, which highlighted the paradox perspective. Then we develop three hypotheses in which we argue how the dynamic capabilities underpinning international ambidexterity could be considered a driver of CS in EMNEs. We test the developed hypotheses against data from 300 Chinese EMNEs obtained by a survey. Our results contribute to shape ambidextrous international strategies and to consider CS as a springboard for the strategic intent to systematically and recursively outperform global competition.

We identify the elements of the cluster that influence the innovation of firms: context, collective strategy, public policy, commercialization, proactivity, external relations, collaboration, assimilation, transformation and application of knowledge, governance, infrastructure, and financial and human resources. We compare these elements with field research and offer four propositions in relation to how clusters influence firms in terms of innovation strategy, culture, management, and infrastructure.

Adaptive or transitional change (morphostasis) can help these organizations survive and achieve their goals through learning to perform their chosen strategies in a different environment. On the other hand, transformative change (morphogenesis) leads organizations to learn by questioning their purposes, value systems, routines, and operating paradigms, and by moving out of their comfort zone. In this conceptual article, we outline these two change pathways, and we present the learning opportunities that they create for extension and advisory organizations. Agricultural digitalization emerged as a radical innovation, punctuating the gradual evolution of the agrifood sector and having the potential to fundamentally restructure the context within which extension and advisory organizations operate. Digital technologies are expected to alter the practice and culture of animal farming in the future. To suit the changing environmental conditions, organizations can make minor adjustments or can call into question their purposes, belief systems, and operating paradigms. Each pattern of change is associated with different types of organizational learning. In this conceptual article, adopting an organizational learning perspective and building upon organizational change models, we present two potential change and learning pathways that extension and advisory organizations can follow to cope with digitalization: morphostasis and morphogenesis. Morphostatic change has a transitional nature and helps organizations survive by adapting to the new environmental conditions. Organizations that follow this pathway learn by recognizing and correcting errors. This way, they increase their competence in specific services and activities. Morphogenetic change, on the other hand, occurs when organizations acknowledge the need to move beyond existing operating paradigms, redefine their purposes, and explore new possibilities. By transforming themselves, organizations learn new ways to understand and interpret contextual cues. We conclude by presenting some factors that explain extension and advisory organizations' tendency to morphostasis.",2020,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani10112056,C13,9,2020,Article,0,0,0,0,0.070247389,0,0,0,0,0.348042254,0.195398712,0,0.095193637,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.090715171,0,0.022535723,0,0.041106122,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.072957442,0,0,0,0.248395369,0,0,0.091482826,0.073845618,0,0,0.107319994,0.194267798,0.070616666,0,0,0.075224569,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.061013113,0.135088774,0,0.211745276,0.099719186,0.051159775,0,0.088466506,0.209821267,0,0.038376907,0.041939826,0,0,0,0.192590139,0.094379955,0,0,0.06133216,0.149837189,0,0,0.054659601,0.037933258,0.056856263,0,0,0.600078389,0,0.056057675,0,0.120131006,0,0.062461655,0,0,0.097983989,0.253275829,0.076634214,,,,,,,1,,,,1,7

Further, the moderating effect of environmental dynamism (ED) on the relationship between TL and innovation ambidexterity was examined. Design/methodology/approach - Empirical study was adopted by distributing questionnaires to high echelon leaders in mainland China to assess related variables. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the relationships of the variables based on the 188 returned questionnaires. Findings - The results show that LAS had a positive effect on innovation ambidexterity, and the relationship was partially mediated by TL. ED negatively moderated the relationship between TL and innovation ambidexterity. Practical implications - The results suggest that upper echelon leaders receive more unfamiliar, outward-oriented, and source-diverse information to broaden their attention scope. The broad outlook they get obliges them to engage in TL behavior which is beneficial for innovation ambidexterity. Originality/value - Based on upper echelons theory, this research reveals the realization mechanism of innovation ambidexterity from the perspectives of leader attention and leadership behavior. This paper avoids the previous research limitation of prevalently employing demographic measurements to substitute for leaders' psychological processes.

Most importantly, the study looks into the patterns of international co-invention or the links of these locations to headquarters and other company subsidiaries. Design/methodology/approach - The study explores the cases of six US multinationals that file international patent applications in China. The applications were analyzed based on the composition of invention teams and the locations of inventors. Findings - The co-invented patent filings by US multinational enterprises (MNEs) in China demonstrate a high degree of US-Chinese subsidiary collaboration. Links with other subsidiaries are marginal, and at the same time, high levels of sole patenting by inventors in China point to competence-creating research and development (R&D) activities taking place. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the contextual understanding of the rich landscape of R&D activities of major US MNEs in China. By exploring these cases, the paper identifies a number of trends. First, the R&D activities in this sample are highly concentrated in technological clusters located in Beijing and Shanghai. Technological clustering is an important advantage of the innovation landscape in emerging markets. Second, the paper underscores the importance of differentiating between different types of coinvention. The patent applications in this sample tend to unite inventors mostly from the US and China, and so multi-country applications involving subsidiaries in other countries are rare. Thus, the level of integration outside the center-host bandwidth is low. However, Chinese subsidiaries demonstrate high levels of autonomy by filing single-country applications, which implies that they are building their own research identity.",2021,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJOEM-03-2019-0171,C12,1,2017,Journal,0,0.107427202,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.10015136,0.118557853,0,0,0.111047447,0.055713477,0,0,0.095439653,0,0.011854696,0,0.043246946,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.095707779,0.231918355,0.115135642,0.099579434,0.337242733,0,0,0,0.087621623,0,0,0.116691372,0.108222781,0,0,0,0.469265866,0.280777182,0,0.090044764,0,0.080411457,0.0641907,0,0.199158867,0.192572099,0,0,0,0.104912601,0.053824196,0,0.093073877,0,0.419650405,0.040375592,0.022062035,0.215496614,0,0,0.101310155,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.079817673,0,0,0,0,0.183084216,0.02948859,0,0,0.070323846,0,0.085283523,0,0,0,0,1,,,1,1,1,1,,,,,12

Besides, researches on the relationship of paradoxical leadership with team innovation and individual innovation are still in the exploratory stage. OBJECTIVE: Integrating paradoxical leadership theory, role system theory and role engagement theory, we developed a multilevel, dual process model to explore the mechanisms through which paradoxical leadership simultaneously affect individual innovation and team innovation. METHODS: Based on the multiphase, multisource data collected from 367 employees of 80 teams in Fujian and Jiangsu province in China, Structural equation model (SEM) and Hierarchical Linear Model (HLM) were applied to analyze the survey data. RESULTS: Our empirical results revealed that, (1) At the individual level, role engagement positively contributes to individual innovation. (2) At the team level, paradoxical leadership exerted positive influence on team innovation, and team coordination mediates the relationship between paradoxical leadership and team innovation. (3) At the cross level, paradoxical leadership positively contributed to individual innovation, and the variables role engagement and team coordination play a cross-level mediation role in the relationship of paradoxical leadership and individual innovation. Furthermore, team coordination moderates the relationship between role engagement and individual innovation. CONCLUSIONS: By combining paradoxical leadership theory, role system theory and role engagement theory, we proposed a multilevel theoretical framework, taking a meaningful step for explaining the relationship and the influence mechanism between paradoxical leadership and team innovation and individual innovation.

It also explores the role of specific institutional factors - corruption and intellectual property rights (IPR) protection - on this relationship. Design/methodology/approach In the study, co-inventor data from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) applications have been used to construct networks of technological knowledge collaboration at the country level over the years 2002-2015. Using eigenvector centrality as the dependent variable, the study uses fixed effect regression analyses on a panel of 171 countries, contributing to recent debates on knowledge networks and international cooperation. Findings Building on research in economic development, innovation and social network theory, this research finds that co-patenting with Chinese inventors is positively related to a country's centrality in global knowledge networks and that this relationship is negatively moderated by collaboration with the current most central knowledge network - namely that of the USA - suggesting a substitution effect.

Specifically, we suggest that successful internal and external boundary-spanning must overcome the intended or unintended indifference to internal or external ideas that result from the strong pull of local search.

As an emerging digital technology, blockchain provides firms with new ways of creating and capturing value, new information exchange mechanisms and trading systems, as well as new organizational forms. In recent years, Some studies have noted that blockchain technology plays an imperative role in manufacturing firms' innovation quality. However, relevant research considering the effect of blockchain technology on innovation quality is still poorly elaborated. At the same time, we put forward that managerial discretion also has considerable implications for innovation. Given that blockchain technology is still in the experimental stage for business use, managers would rather adopt other technologies that bring profits in the short term than blockchain technology as far as their stakeholders' satisfaction is concerned. For this reason, managers with higher managerial discretion are more likely to leverage blockchain technology to facilitate innovation. Yet, little research has focused on the critical role of managerial discretion on firms' innovation quality. Taking together the foregoing discussions, this paper is designed to analyze the impact of blockchain technology on innovation quality. We also divide managerial discretion into environmental discretion, organizational discretion, and additional discretion in the Chinese context, analyzing their moderating effects on the relationship between blockchain technology and innovation quality respectively. Further, relevant hypotheses are tested empirically using a panel data set of Chinese listed manufacturing firms involved in the blockchain business from 2012 to 2019. The findings are listed as follows: With an increasing expenditure on blockchain technology, firms' innovation quality exhibits an initially decreasing trend and then an increasing trend. Additionally, it is proved that environmental discretion, organizational discretion and additional discretion in the Chinese context all positively moderate the relationship between blockchain technology and firms' innovation quality.",2021,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2021.108219,C14,1,2018,Conference Paper,0,0,0,0.127193524,0,0,0,0.171168207,0,0.132164155,0,0,0,0.171168207,0,0.123460589,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.171716333,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.167416362,0.055409127,0.143768065,0.324596712,0,0,0,0,0,0.112167344,0,0.07812346,0,0,0,0.135500761,0.540497042,0,0,0.257175381,0,0.092675489,0,0.143768065,0.185350978,0,0,0,0.151467839,0,0,0,0,0.151467839,0.291461826,0,0,0,0.088651953,0,0,0.120510571,0,0,0,0,0.072279404,0,0.115236972,0,0,0,0,0,0.127722686,0.147969423,0.091236123,0,0,0.123128306,0,0,0,0.116403064,1,,,1,1,1,1,,,,,12

This paper seeks to test the ambidexterity hypothesis by examining how exploration and exploitation can jointly influence firm performance in the context of firms' approach to technological innovation. Based on a sample of 206 manufacturing firms, we find evidence consistent with the ambidexterity hypothesis by showing that (1) the interaction between explorative and exploitative innovation strategies is positively related to sales growth rate, and (2) the relative imbalance between explorative and exploitative innovation strategies is negatively related to sales growth rate.",2004,,,C8,4,2021,Journal,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.38048408,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.117761535,0.113577607,0.014627329,0.236849086,0.106723495,0,0,0,0,0.200025606,0,0.145820935,0,0.145357765,0.102717407,0,0,0.213096173,0,0,0,0.19347207,0.146755179,0,0.118758063,0,0,0.267068884,0.069658509,0.126093981,0.091670741,0.231608002,0.11548223,0.097652472,0,0,0,0.158407854,0,0,0.079203927,0.087682475,0,0,0,0,0,0.11484244,0.136189317,0,0.049818828,0.054444017,0,0.143080263,0,0,0.12251896,0.102992826,0,0.079618097,0.194510546,0,0,0.070956141,0,0,0,0.212169888,0.129831558,0,0.036385523,0,0.233921374,0.086771523,0.24325304,0,0,0.127197522,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,,1,4

It examines some complications in allocating resources between the two, particularly those introduced by the distribution of costs and benefits across time and space, and the effects of ecological interaction. Two general situations involving the development and used of knowledge in organizations are modeled.

It seeks to answer these research questions: is there any difference among the effects of different types of open innovation activities on radical innovation? How does the organizational learning ability influence the impact of customer knowledge management on radical innovation? Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on the data collected from a sample of 165 modern service enterprises located in the Yangtze River Delta region. The authors conducted a structural equation modeling analysis using SPSS and MPLUS to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings - The results showed that different kinds of open innovation activities had different impacts on the path to radical innovation. Inbound open innovation activities directly influenced radical innovation while the effect of outbound open innovation activities on radical innovation combined with the organizational exploitative learning ability is indirect. Similarly, the empirical results also proved that customer knowledge management had an indirect effect on radical innovation through the organizational learning ability, and the influence of the exploratory learning ability was more prominent. Originality/value - Under the background of the national innovation driven by the development strategy, this paper studies the impact mechanism of radical innovation from the perspectives of open innovation and customer knowledge management.

However, by itself, creating value through innovation is not enough for companies: transforming these innovations into firm performance is also crucial. This study aims to validate the relationships among innovation and firm performance components and to explore the effect of innovation culture on innovation components and personnel performance. In our model, the innovation construct is comprised of innovation input, innovation process, and innovation output components, while firm performance construct includes four performance components such as financial, customer, market, and personnel performance. Moreover, this comprehensive model was proposed based on the literature, and structural equation modeling (SEM) was performed by employing data gained from 353 companies in Turkey to validate the model. According to the results, there is a sequential relationship within innovation components and firm performance components, while the relationships among innovation components and firm performance components are observed holistically. This paper contributes to the innovation literature by introducing a validated model to clarify these relationships. This model can be evaluated by company leaders to identify not only their firm's innovation path but also short and long-term innovation results. Furthermore, the findings indicate that companies should manage the system from innovation input to financial gains without delicately compromising the whole sequential and holistic relationship.

First, to understand recombinant innovation (RI) as a potentially significant part of an open innovation (OI) strategy and second, to suggest key routines which would underpin a capability for RI, locating these within the context of enhanced absorptive capacity (AC). Finally, the paper considers how such routines could be developed, drawing on some case examples.

The authors then explore one OI route - RI - and suggest a model framework for operationalizing it based on routines for search, acquisition, assimilation and deployment. Findings - The authors suggest three sets of routines required for RI, around abstract-driven search (ADS), brokerage and cyclic adaptation. As with much of the now widely available toolkit for OI, the challenge is one of moving from potential to realized opportunity and this will require investments in learning and capability building.

This study is a preliminary effort to use data mining and symmetry-based learning concepts, especially classification, to assist the identification of strategies to incentivize intention to innovate in companies. Using the decision tree classification technique, we analyzed a sample of Chilean companies (N = 5876). The sample was divided into large enterprises (LEs) and small and medium enterprises (SMEs). In the group of large companies, the barriers that most impact the intention to innovate are innovation cost, lack of demand innovations, and lack of qualified personnel. Alternatively, in the group of small-medium companies, the barriers that most impact the intention to innovate are lack of own funds, lack of demand innovations, and lack of information about technology.

Thus, the purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between IT capability and open innovation performance and to expose the inner mechanism at the firm level. Design/methodology/approach This paper collected firm-level data in China; 232 usable questionnaires from different firms were collected. Then, the study used a structural equation model by AMOS for hypothesis testing. Findings The results indicate that both internal IT capability and external IT capability have positive impacts on open innovation performance; potential absorptive capacity and realized absorptive capacity mediate the relationship between external IT capability and open innovation performance. Additionally, realized absorptive capacity plays a mediating role in the relationship between internal IT capability and open innovation performance. Originality/value Existing research has emphasized the influence of IT on open innovation, but empirical studies have not thoroughly focused on the inner mechanisms of the effect of IT capability on open innovation performance. Drawing on firm capability theory, this paper classifies IT capability as internal and external IT capability and absorptive capacity as potential and realized absorptive capacity.

In addition, this paper also seeks to search for contextual variables that affect this complementarity. Design/methodology/approach This study takes systems approach to examine complementarity, combining a productivity and an adoption approach. In addition, interaction approach is also used as robustness check. Findings The authors show that the positive effect of export activity on firms' growth rate is higher for firms that also engage in technology import, and vice versa. Furthermore, they show that, Ceteris paribus, firms' adoption of one cross-border learning mechanism (e.g. entering export markets) positively influences the adoption of the other (e.g. technology import). Moreover, this complementarity is only significant for firms from province with low level of marketization. Research limitations/implications - This inconsistency about learning-by-exporting and technology import on innovation can be resolved, at least partially, by the complementarities perspective. This paper also reveals two mechanisms of learning-by-exporting: the indirect effect of export on innovation through increasing the likelihood of adoption decision of importing technology and enhancing the positive effect of technology imports. Practical implications - The potential of combining the two strategies should not be ignored by managers. To improve regional competitiveness, local governments should try best to improve the efficiency of customs to help firms realize the synergistic effect of learning-by-exporting and learning-by-technology-importing. Originality/value - This study first explores the positive complementarity between the two cross-border learning mechanism in sharping EEEs 2019 innovation performance and identifies the condition to realize the synergistic effect of learning-by-exporting and learning-by-technology-importing.",2019,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EJM-10-2017-0683,C4,1,2022,Journal,0,0,0.089149183,0,0,0,0.083096883,0,0,0.070598454,0.554897731,0.083345722,0.07723802,0,0.058053597,0.065949248,0,0.042966952,0,0,0.073604291,0.070989217,0.009142494,0,0.100057806,0,0,0,0,0.062510831,0,0,0,0.090852715,0.12840257,0,0,0.192387197,0.076796942,0,0.074646622,0.241851034,0.091726138,0,0.074227149,0.059916707,0,0.125194206,0.130615617,0.315249221,0.057296806,0.072380777,0,0.061035558,0,0,0,0,0.231051023,0.076796942,0.09900939,0.109608054,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.255366528,0,0.031138177,0.051043576,0,0,0,0.078131697,0,0,0,0.049763563,0.040524865,0,0,0.088699191,0.030778209,0.092263837,0,0,0,0.070598454,0.045483962,0,0.146207476,0,0.354760073,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,1,1,7

The results of the logit regressions suggest that a combined STI and DUI innovation approach yields better results in terms of product innovation. Contrary to the existing literature, our results point out that in an emerging economy context, the weight of DUI mode of innovation is larger on product innovation than the STI mode.

We studied a firm, which was producing and launching digital platforms for managing organizational operations. Drawing on a case study of developing this digital platform, we identified three recurring calculative and narrative practices: ideating; concocting; aligning. We argue that through these practices various epistemic objects (which we call 'learning catalogue') were enacted representing the emerging consensus of the usage and market potential for the digital innovation under development, and simultaneously enabling actors to create new knowledge of what was not known. This dynamic learning catalogue represented the constantly evolving implicit business model for value generation. We offer significant contributions to business model studies in the context of digital innovation projects, and implications for the transformation of the contextual and technical uncertainty into calculable risk.",2017,Conference Paper,,C16,2,2022,Article,0,0,0.088253746,0,0,0,0.082262237,0,0,0.069889345,0.549324197,0.082508576,0.076462221,0,0.057470492,0.065286837,0,0.042535381,0,0,0.072864991,0.070276183,0.009050665,0,0.0990528,0,0,0,0,0.061882956,0,0,0,0.089940167,0.127112862,0,0,0.190454811,0.076025574,0,0.073896852,0.23942182,0.090804817,0,0.146963185,0.059314889,0,0.123936723,0.12930368,0.312082777,0.056721303,0.071653766,0,0.060422501,0,0,0,0,0.228730288,0.076025574,0.098014914,0.108507123,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.252801562,0,0.030825417,0.050530881,0,0,0,0.077346922,0,0,0,0.049263725,0.040117822,0,0,0.087808274,0.030469065,0.091337116,0,0,0,0.069889345,0.045027109,0,0.144738931,0,0.351196772,0,0,0,0,0.061554768,1,,,,,,,,,1,1,7

However, many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) still do not know how to effectively realize business model innovation. Exploring the factors affecting the realization of business model innovation or the effective path to promote business model innovation in SMEs has become a hot topic of research. Exogenous growth theory points out that network ties have become an important way for SMEs to obtain external resources and promote enterprise growth. However, the existing research ignores the impact of network ties on the SMEs' business model innovation. Focusing on this theoretical gap, this study constructs a network ties - business model innovation - enterprise growth model to explore the influence mechanism of five network ties of SMEs: customer ties, supplier ties, competitor ties, political ties, and knowledge ties on business model innovation and enterprise growth. Based on a questionnaire survey of 234 SMEs in Chengdu, China, the research hypothesis was tested using PLS-SEM and fsQCA. The PLS-SME results show that the customers, suppliers, competitors, and knowledge ties of SMEs have a significant positive effect on business model innovation, and business model innovation has a significant positive effect on enterprise growth. In addition, business model innovation plays a mediating role between supplier ties, competitor ties, knowledge ties, and enterprise growth. The fsQCA results show that three paths lead to high-level business model innovation of SMEs, among which customer ties, supplier ties, competition ties, and knowledge ties are the necessary conditions, and three paths lead to high-level growth of SMEs, among which business model innovation is the most core necessary condition. The conclusion of this study not only enriches the relevant research on social network theory and business model innovation but also provides practical insights for SME managers to use network ties to realize business model innovation and promote enterprise growth.",2022,Journal,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3158749,C17,2,2020,Article,0,0,0,0.092236359,0.038688247,0,0,0,0.027360394,0,0,0.113145937,0.052427214,0,0.039405314,0,0.058131096,0,0.047788577,0.175461021,0.049960731,0.048185685,0.006205694,0,0.067916708,0.051683499,0,0,0,0,0,0.123730054,0,0.370011152,0.043578209,0.050101089,0,0,0,0,0.050668239,0.492487097,0,0,0,0,0,0.141631101,0.059105718,0.1069916,0.038891623,0.196520963,0.440943553,0,0,0.04662368,0,0.033602535,0,0,0.033602535,0.037199588,0,0,0.164758884,0.02817588,0.061278812,0.048722295,0.05777878,0.054919628,0.021135807,0.080843207,0.056404063,0,0,0.05303382,0.051979085,0.043695056,0.047007673,0,0,0,0.052414532,0.060206768,0.02089147,0.062626359,0,0.090013796,0.110162959,0,0.030873363,0.053651163,0,0.11043934,0.034400309,0.089288404,0.333600445,0.107927961,0,0.08441149,1,,,,,,,,,1,1,7
