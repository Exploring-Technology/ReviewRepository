Examining the survival path of export enterprises under COVID-19,CHINESE MANAGEMENT STUDIES,,10.1108/CMS-07-2021-0313,"Purpose The rising uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment exacerbate the challenges firms face in the export market. This study aims to explore which strategy is suitable for export enterprises to develop sustainably under COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach Based on the sample data of China's A-stock listed manufacturing firms from 2010 to 2020, this study applies a survival analysis method to explore the impact of strategic flexibility on export firm survival. Furthermore, this study uses the difference-in-difference model to test the relationship between strategic flexibility and firms' profits in the context of the pandemic. Findings The results show that strategic flexibility can increase firms' survival time, improving dynamic production and innovation capabilities, which is favorable for their sustainable development. Meanwhile, after the spread of COVID-19, firms with strategic flexibility have higher profits than those without. This influence mechanism mainly involves exploring new markets that can improve the company revenue and the coordination capabilities of the supply chain; this reduces corporate costs. Originality/value This study expands relevant research on the factors affecting the survival of export enterprises and supplements research on the economic consequences of firms' strategic flexibility; this also enriches the dynamic capability theory. Additionally, it provides important implications for firms to enhance strategic flexibility and recommends government implementation of policies that encourage the domestic sales of commodities originally produced for exports under COVID-19.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/CMS-07-2021-0313,WOS,Journal

This paper presents an understanding of a conceptual framework for delivering a unique manufacturing leadership programme, explaining the different linkages between government, industry and academia for changing the mindset of participants and growth of a nation by developing highly skilful employees to lead India's manufacturing industry. Design/methodology/approach The paper reports a single case study of an innovative manufacturing leadership development programme. Primary data were obtained from focus group studies and interviews. Documentary evidence in the form of reports, student work, course curriculum and meeting minutes was studied. The individual participants in the programme are used as units of analysis to explore systems of innovation, at individual levels. The analysis was carried out by applying theoretical models to explain the design, delivery and development of the programme over the years. Findings The findings from this research are an exploration of factors for sustaining the value of a system of innovation with special focus on a subsystem of knowledge creation and competence building. Institutional change is found to be a key input to the innovation process in terms of a collaborative mindset between three different academic institutes well known in different areas of expertise. Building an innovative coordination mechanism and curriculum combining academics with practical learning helped in changing the mindset of the students and faculty of the programme. This is linked to the development of country through leadership development by mindset change in mentors and students. The findings show that the studied programme has grown in terms of creating demand (in the form of increased applicants), guaranteeing 100 per cent placement with an average 50 per cent increase in salary and accelerated career in terms of role in the organisation. This was possible through continuous improvement practices for making local changes to the programme from time to time and building a community of practice in collaboration with industry. Originality/value The value of this research lies in highlighting the importance of international cooperation in speeding up the process of transferring management and technological knowledge from academia to industry. The framework developed for implementing a system of learning for creating a national system of innovation in manufacturing can be generalised to develop more such programmes in emerging nations for addressing skill challenges to lead future innovative projects.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJIS-07-2016-0016,WOS,Journal

(2021),"Influence of knowledge sharing, innovation passion and absorptive capacity on innovation behaviour in China",JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT,,10.1108/JOCM-08-2020-0237,"Purpose - This paper aims to address the question of what can significantly impact employees' IB and how employees' IB may be effectively stimulated by investigating key factors such as employees' knowledge sharing, innovation passion, absorptive capacity and risk-taking behaviour on workplace innovation. The moderating role of risk-taking behaviour on the link between absorptive capacity and innovation behaviour is also investigated. Design/methodology/approach - Based on the principles of social exchange theory, the study design explores the complex relationship among knowledge sharing, innovation passion, absorptive capacity and risk-taking vis-a-vis employees' innovation behaviour within a unified analysis framework. Methodologically, employees in the information technology industry in China were surveyed via a questionnaire instrument, with a total of 318 valid questionnaires being collected online. Following a reliability and validity test of the questionnaire, the Smart PLS was used to verify the research model. Findings - Statistically significant results reported were as follows: (1) employees' innovation behaviour is positively impacted by knowledge sharing, innovation passion and absorptive capacity; (2) employees' innovation behaviour is negatively impacted by risk-taking behaviour; (3) knowledge sharing is positively impacted by innovation passion; (4) absorptive capacity is positively impacted by innovation passion; and (5) risk-taking behaviour regulates the relationship between absorptive capacity and innovation behaviour. Research limitations/implications - Owing to limited research resources, 318 front-line employees were surveyed via an online questionnaire vis-a-vis the sampling method only, specifically taking knowledge sharing, innovation passion, absorptive capacity and risk-taking behaviour as antecedent variables with implications on how employees' innovation behaviour may be stimulated. Originality/value - The mechanism of augmenting employees' innovation behaviour is chiefly explained from the perspective of innovation passion and risk-taking behaviour, which are conducive towards promoting employees' willingness to improve knowledge sharing and innovation behaviour. The social exchange theory is used as a basis to form an integrated model for the research, contributing to a cumulative theoretical perspective for future work on the impact of innovation passion and risk-taking behaviour on innovation.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JOCM-08-2020-0237,WOS,Journal

(2017),Operationalizing mHealth to improve patient care: A qualitative implementation science evaluation of the WelTel texting intervention in Canada and Kenya,Globalization and Health,ANC; Canada; HIV; Kenya; Maternal and child health; mHealth; Mobile health; Sms; Tb; WelTel,10.1186/s12992-017-0311-z,"Background: Mobile health (mHealth) applications have proliferated across the globe with much enthusiasm, although few have reached scale and shown public health impact. In this study, we explored how different contextual factors influenced the implementation, effectiveness and potential for scale-up of WelTel, an easy-to-use and evidence-based mHealth intervention. WelTel uses two-way SMS communication to improve patient adherence to medication and engagement in care, and has been developed and tested in Canada and Kenya. Methods: We used a comparative qualitative case study design, which drew on 32 key informant interviews, conducted in 2016, with stakeholders involved in six WelTel projects. Our research was guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), a meta-theoretical framework, and our analysis relied on a modified approach to grounded theory, which allowed us to compare findings across these projects. Results: We found that WelTel had positive influences on the ""culture of care"" at local clinics and hospitals in Canada and Kenya, many of which stretched beyond the immediate patient-client relationship to influence wider organizational systems. However, these were mediated by clinician norms and practices, the availability of local champion staff, the receptivity and capacity of local management, and the particular characteristics of the technology platform, including the ability for adaptation and co-design. We also found that scale-up was influenced by different forms of data and evidence, which played important roles in legitimization and partnership building. Even with robust research evidence, scale-up was viewed as a precarious and uncertain process, embedded within the wider politics and financing of Canadian and Kenyan health systems. Challenges included juggling different interests, determining appropriate financing pathways, maintaining network growth, and ""packaging"" the intervention for impact and relevance. Conclusions: Our comparative case study, of a unique transnational mobile health research network, revealed that moving from mHealth pilots to scale is a difficult, context-specific process that couples social and technological innovation. Fostering new organizational partnerships and ways of learning are paramount, as mHealth platforms straddle the world of research, industry and public health. Partnerships need to avoid the perils of the technological fix, and engage the structural barriers that mediate people's health and access to services.

(2020),"Ambidextrous culture, innovation strategy and entrepreneurial performance of high-tech firms A knowledge flow perspective",Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management,Ambidextrous culture; Innovative strategies; Knowledge flow; Network tie strength; Power distance,10.13587/j.cnki.jieem.2020.02.004,"The entrepreneurial innovation of technology enterprises in a turbulent environment not only results in continuous breakthroughs in creation, but also gradually builds up the dynamic core competence of these enterprises throughout the process. This requires support from enterprises in the form of ambidextrous strategic implementation.Organizational ambidexterity theory proposes systematic mechanisms such as structure, leadership, and situation to resolve various paradoxes that exist in enterprise creation, exploration, and efficiency development. Among them, situational ambidexterity is the most long-term, and more recognized mechanism. The construction and operability of this ambidexterity in corporate practice is still vague. Ambidextrous enterprise culture has become a cutting-edge method for studying ambidextrous situations in recent years. Scholars believe that ambidextrous culture is a new type of dynamic ability, which is characterized by two seemingly contradictory organizational features: organizational diversity and shared vision, and is helpful to organize a balanced operation of exploration and development. Theoretical and case studies show that the ambidextrous enterprise culture plays a significant role in promoting the innovation and upgrading of enterprises. Some quantitative research at the team level also shows that it has a positive effect on teamsâ€™ ambidextrous innovation behavior; but at the enterprise level, how this cultural mechanism regulates the implementation of corporate innovation strategies in order to improve entrepreneurial performance is still a mystery. In addition, some studies believe that the multiple effects of ambidextrous elements are better than the single antecedents, but with regards to the mechanism of this interaction and the role of each antecedent, cannot provide a clear empirical explanation. Based on situational ambidexterity theory, cognitive learning theory, and innovation theory, this study regards the process of enterprise â€œorganization-strategy-performanceâ€ as the process of knowledge creation and flow to achievement, and explores the ambidextrous enterprise culture (knowledge creation) from the enterprise level, as well as the mechanisms influencing the entrepreneurial performance (knowledge outcomes) of Chinese technology companies through innovative strategic behaviors (knowledge utilization). In order to better explain this long-term mechanism, a network structure (network tie strength, i.e., knowledge absorption) and a leadership (power distance, i.e., knowledge transfer) is interjected between the ambidextrous culture and the innovation strategy, in order to observe the ambidexterity of combined process of the three antecedents. Control variables are added to the industry, R&D investment, corporate nature, and managerial experience as consideration. On the whole, a mechanism for promoting the entrepreneurial development of technology enterprises based on cross-layer knowledge flow is constructed. In order to verify the above model, the study conducted a survey of 283 small and micro-technology enterprises, using SPSS and AMOS software for model validation analysis, reliability and validity testing, correlation analysis, and linear regression analysis, and tested the relevance, mediation, and regulation for all variables. The results show that the ambidextrous enterprise culture has a positive impact on the implementation of breakthrough-oriented and profit-oriented innovation strategies, and enhances the innovation performance of science and technology enterprises through its intermediary role in innovation strategy implementation. The network tie strength positively adjusts the impact of ambidextrous culture on profit-oriented innovation behavior, and negatively adjusts the impact of regulation on breakthrough-oriented innovation behavior; the power distance negatively regulates the influence of ambidextrous culture on breakthrough-oriented innovation behavior, but does not significantly regulate the impact on profit-oriented innovation behavior. The conclusions of the study have strengthened the theoretical basis of the ambidextrous enterprise culture, by supplementing previous theories and case studies on its pre-existing effects on organizational performance, while highlighting the fundamental status of the situation, building a relatively complete mechanism for promoting innovation and entrepreneurship, and implying a possible interaction or hindrance between the three antecedents. In addition, a flow of business entrepreneurial knowledge from a cognitive perspective is constructed, and the value-added process from resource to performance is explained. The knowledge-flow model of the five-factor division of labor has revealed the mechanism of interaction of multiple knowledge carriers to some extent.

Design/methodology/approach: This empirical study was executed in a large global company that produces and markets footwear for B2B and B2C markets. The company operates in more than 18 countries and adopts the gamification to train 7,600 sellers and 10,052 professionals directly linked to the sales area. The methodology adopted followed a qualitative and exploratory approach based on an in-depth case study analysis. Findings: Results indicated that the use of predictive gamification allowed mitigating future problems, in average, four months in advance of the arrival of the new products at the points of sale. The main findings included improvement in sales arguments, product knowledge and sales closure. The company assigns the results to the implementation of the gamification and the possibility to simulate the evaluation of the level of readiness of the sales force resources. For this, the following three primary variables emerged: adequate definition of training content, analysis of the learning process and simulation of store reality. Research limitations/implications: The authors introduced to the sales training literature the concept of predictive gamification. The predictive gamification allows anticipating and reducing future problems before the arrival of the new products in the market, improving the argument of sales, the knowledge about the products and the ratio of sales conversion of stores. Practical implications: First, the content design of gamification needs to be carefully projected before the simulator development, considering the target audience and its particularities. Second, the construction of evaluation activities needs to consider contexts, actions and results. Third, monitoring the paths taken by the seller in the simulator environment is requisite. Fourth, the analysis of the results of vendor responses in the simulator environment can be obtained through learning management system reports. Fifth, the development of game simulators with advanced technologies may be done with low investment. Originality/value: The findings have implications for the field vis-Ã -vis three main research gaps identified in the literature discussing gamification in sales training. First, the authors identified best practices from the application of gamification in sales training.

Higher education institutions play a key role in this transformation. This paper aims to conduct a comparative analysis by continents of innovation and sustainability barriers in universities. The document also offers opportunities and potential actions for universities to create initiatives to minimize barriers and move towards a sustainable future. Design/methodology/approach: To carry out the study, 25 closed questions, composed of a five-point Likert scale, were applied to 283 university representatives (rectors, managers or specialists in the area of innovation and sustainability), to check the degree of application of the questionnaire. Findings: From an exploratory statistical analysis, it was found that the main barriers were lacking of planning and focus, lacking of environmental committee, lacking of applicability and continuity of actions and resistance to changes. Among continents, Africa and Oceania presented the best innovation and sustainability indicators in universities. The main approach of this exploratory study on barriers in universities is as an international research, whose findings showed that several barriers currently prevent universities from getting involved in sustainable development efforts. However, as we debate sustainable development, which is gaining momentum, universities are supposed to move forward to overcome barriers for the sake of implementing goals and initiatives. In addition, universities must seize opportunities to contribute through innovation in teaching, research and initiatives to achieve the 17 sustainable development goals. Research limitations/implications: This study has two main limitations: first, online research has involved professionals working in the field of sustainable development in higher education. Second, there were no interviews conducted to gather personal information with students and servers. However, the broad scope of the study and its strong international base provide important results that enable the design of an adequate profile of sustainability and innovation challenges that are currently found in universities. Practical implications: The study showed that there is lack of knowledge management to connect science, technology, innovation and sustainability, to improve management conditions, innovate, make decisions, support initiatives, create incentives and control mechanisms. Trends suggest that future professional activities involve skills in dealing with complex problems, sometimes in careers and jobs yet to be created. Traditional teaching methods are generally only prepared for routine tasks and for existing jobs, thus requiring the creation of new approaches capable of stimulating creativity and autonomy, which are essential for the present and future demands of innovation and sustainability. Social implications: The exploratory study on barriers in universities brings international research as main approach, which made it possible to check that several barriers currently prevent universities from getting involved in sustainable development efforts. However, as we debate sustainable development, which is gaining momentum, it is important that universities should move forward to overcome the barriers to implementation of goals and initiatives. In addition, universities should take advantage of opportunities to contribute through innovation in teaching, research and action to achieve the 17 sustainable development goals. Originality/value: Developed countries are leaders in promoting sustainability, while developing or underdeveloped countries are laggards. In this approach, the study sought to verify the differences through a comparative analysis across continents. As for originality and innovation, this paper presents an international study in the view of specialists who respond based on the experience of their university.

As salespeople are constantly facing different customers with various needs and want and engaging in a different sales situation, salespeople must deploy their inner capabilities in practicing adaptive selling behavior during and across sales interactions. This study also investigates the impact of salesperson's intrapersonal leadership - where leadership stems from the individuals with the purpose to influence oneself. Design/methodology/approach Authors draw on the social cognitive theory of self-regulation to develop our model and examine the relationship between self-monitoring, thought self-leadership and adaptive selling behavior. We empirically test the model using data from 335 pharmaceutical salespeople working across several countries in Asia. Findings The results support the role of self-monitoring and thought self-leadership as antecedents to adaptive selling. Further, the results suggest that self-monitoring positively moderates the relationship between thought self-leadership and adaptive selling behavior. In light of these results, we explore implications and limitations and conclude by suggesting directions for further research. Research limitations/implications - The sampling method used was convenience sampling, which may limit the theoretical generalization of our results across all emerging markets. Moreover, this study examines the direct impact of self-management mechanism on adaptive selling behavior and the way it interacts with salesperson's thought self- leadership to strengthen adaptive selling behavior. However, the research model does not include organization-level drivers.

In contrast, results do not find support for the relationship between interdepartmental connectedness and KM capability, whereas both KM capability and environmental dynamism have a direct influence on OI. Originality/value - This paper adds to existing research on OI, as it is the first study that addresses the critical role of KM capability for the implementation of OI.",2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JKM-09-2016-0403,WOS,Journal

(2020),A domain knowledge incorporated text mining approach for capturing user needs on BIM applications,ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT,,10.1108/ECAM-02-2019-0097,"Purpose In the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry, technology developers have difficulties in fully understanding user needs due to the high domain knowledge threshold and the lack of effective and efficient methods to minimise information asymmetry between technology developers and AEC users. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach A synthetic approach combining domain knowledge and text mining techniques is proposed to help capture user needs, which is demonstrated using building information modelling (BIM) apps as a case. The synthetic approach includes the: collection and cleansing of BIM apps' attribute data and users' comments; incorporation of domain knowledge into the collected comments; performance of a sentiment analysis to distinguish positive and negative comments; exploration of the relationships between user sentiments and BIM apps' attributes to unveil user preferences; and establishment of a topic model to identify problems frequently raised by users. Findings The results show that those BIM app categories with high user interest but low sentiments or supplies, such as reality capture, interoperability and structural simulation and analysis, should deserve greater efforts and attention from developers. BIM apps with continual updates and of small size are more preferred by users. Problems related to the support for new Revit, import & export and external linkage are most frequently complained by users. Originality/value The main contributions of this work include: the innovative application of text mining techniques to identify user needs to drive BIM apps development; and the development of a synthetic approach to orchestrating domain knowledge, text mining techniques (i.e. sentiment analysis and topic modelling) and statistical methods in order to help extract user needs for promoting the success of emerging technologies in the AEC industry.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/ECAM-02-2019-0097,WOS,Journal

The authors also examined the moderating role of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and engagement in social interaction on the relationship between PTOs and knowledge sharing. Design/methodology/approach: The study employed a survey method to collect the data and tested the proposed hypotheses by using the partial structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) technique. Data is based on 815 responses across all sectors in the country context of the UAE. Findings: The study findings indicate that PTOs are positively related to knowledge sharing. Notably, the results show that the proposed relationship between PTOs and knowledge sharing is negatively and significantly moderated by intrinsic motivation. Moreover, the moderating roles of extrinsic motivation and engagement in social interaction were insignificant. Originality/value: At a theoretical level, this article provides an individual-level analysis, which indicates that PTOs pave the way for intraorganizational knowledge sharing; hence, they offer insights into the mechanisms in which PTOs impact on knowledge sharing. This article also contributes to our general understanding on human resource management (HRM) practices and knowledge sharing in the context of the emerging economy of the UAE; the latter has a number of implications for both theory and practice as delineated in this study.

(2016),UNIVERSITY-INDUSTRY COOPERATION IN THE RENEWABLE ENERGIES SECTOR: CHALLENGES FROM THE FIRM LEVEL PERSPECTIVE,"ICERI2016: 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION",,,"Purpose: The Triple Helix model proposes a framework of analysis that focuses on the role of universities as key players to boost innovative development at the regional level in a knowledge-based society which involves the interaction of three actors - university, industry and government-. Therefore, most of the prior empirical studies have addressed the role of universities and macro analyses, rather than placing emphasis on the firm perspective. The contribution of such previous empirical works has been of great value to understand the dynamics and interactions between these actors, given the theoretical potential of the Triple Helix model. Nevertheless, this framework still offers interesting gaps to cover, such as studying the value and the practical implications of the role played by firms within this model. Consequently, the objective of this study is to explore the applicability and practical value of the Triple Helix model when it comes to explore the formation and growth of a firm and its contribution to the development of innovation at regional level, as well as to assess its interactions with universities and governments both at European, national and regional levels. In particular, this exploratory study assesses the case of Abengoa, multinational leader in the renewable energies industry, specialized in developing innovative solutions for sustainability in the fields of biotechnology and biochemistry. Design/methodology/approach: For the development of this study we have relied on an eminently qualitative methodology, consisting on a series of interviews with professionals inside Abengoa. The aim of the analysis is to obtain information relative to the structure and growth of Abengoa; its interactions with research groups belonging to universities and public organisms; as well as those that it maintains with the diverse governmental actors (European, national and regional). Findings, theoretical and practical implications: This exploratory study contributes to a greater understanding of the dynamics and nature of interactions within the Triple Helix model, highlighting the existence of broader and more complex interaction spaces when the firm level is taken as the core perspective, which ultimately enriches the Triple Helix framework of analysis. The main practical implication of this study is that it highlights the role of the firm within this triple interaction on the path to a more competitive and innovative development of a certain environment. Research limitations/implications: Taking into account the difficulty that the firm level implies with regard to obtaining primary data on their interactions with other actors in the field of innovation, given their complexity both at structural and organizational levels, this study has a predominantly exploratory orientation. The results of this study offer some interesting insights in order to deepen the analysis of the role of firms within the Triple Helix framework. Originality/value: The originality of this work lies in the fact that the majority of studies in the frame of the Triple Helix is focused on the case of a certain university or is more oriented to the development of a given region. However, there is a scarcity of works that empirically analyze this phenomenon by putting the focus at the firm level. Our work is focused in the case study of the Abengoa corporation, which certainly supposes a novel approach in this field.",2016,,WOS,Conference Paper

Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts a mixed method of quantitative and qualitative data analysis, including a path analysis partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) based on a sample size of 354 responses and a semi-structured interview of 32 participants to test various paths predicting training effectiveness while exploring contextual differences in the Vietnam hospitality sector. Findings: The results show that among the variables investigated, extrinsic motivation, team support and job quality were found to be significant to TD, while intrinsic motivation was found to have no significant predictive power. To explore the reasons behind these findings, the interviews indicate that the motivations of employees in the hospitality sector, most of whom are young and have a limited length of service, are highly rooted in the organizationâ€™s cultural context. Originality/value: This study contributes to understanding the complex context of organizational learning through an investigation of an emerging economy from Southeast Asia by adding new insights into the training and motivational theories.

It helps to reveal the organizational innovation developed by Chinese firms in coping with international competition and technological challenges. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a qualitative method of research. The evidences are mainly collected through interviews, field observation and document analysis. Findings: A pattern of engineer-centered organization is the source of competitiveness of Nanrui (NR) Electric (NREC) in this study. The firm equips its front project teams, and now its overseas branches with developmental human resources and authorizes them the power of decision-making to leverage R&D projects. It is an emerging challenge to the traditional multi-national companies (MNC) pattern, and enables the Chinese firms to build their capabilities on context-based knowledge. Research limitations/implications: As a single-case study paper, there are limitations about the external validity of its argument. Through the in-depth discussion of the NREC case, this paper aims to generate some clues for future study in the relevant academic community, which can be a useful step to formal theorizing and modeling. That is why the authors develop the paper on a single case. As future directions of research, comparative studies covering more cases not only within the power system control and protection industry but also among different complex technology products industrial sectors are really needed. Practical implications: For innovative firms from developing countries like China, they need to develop institutional arrangements to incentivize engineers in the frontline, which may help them to build competence upon successful interaction with customers. During the era of globalization, such a pattern may generate special competitiveness over giant multi-nationals or global production networks (GPNs). Originality/value: The research provides an instructive case on the Chinese rise in industrial sectors of complex product systems. Its findings can not only provide enlightenment for industrial catch-up in developing countries through organizational innovation but also help to initiate a reconsideration of the traditional theorizing of MNC and GPN.

Design/methodology/approach: Survey responses were collected from Amazonâ€™s Mechanical Turk (mTurk), a crowdsourcing internet service, in December 2013. A total of 578 responses were analyzed using partial-least squares structural equation modeling technique. Findings: The model as a whole exhibited 62.8 percent of variance in health-related outcomes. The findings suggest that prior knowledge has a direct effect on health literacy (HL) skills (H3: Î²=0.212, p<0.001). The PHIM stimuli (H4: Î²=0.475, p<0.001) have a direct impact on HL skills, and they have an indirect effect on the comprehension of stimuli (H6: Î²=0.526, p<0.001) through the mediator of stimuli and the knowledge variable. Research limitations/implications: One possible limitation of this study is that the study may include a highly technology literate group, as survey respondents were recruited from the online service mTurk. Practical implications: The study poses implications for further research and practice. This research was an exploratory work for further model development so future studies should investigate deeper into real personal health record (PHR) user groups (e.g. patients and caregivers). For example, studies by White and Horvitz (2009a, b) conducted real-time user studies that the authors could apply to the authorsâ€™ future PHR studies. Since the findings cannot be generalizable to these specific groups, similar research may be conducted. Using caregiver groups of PHR users in comparison to patient groups could determine the similarities and differences of their PHIM activities and related outcomes for optimal design of self-care management. Social implications: Further, it is suggested to conduct large scale, real-time-based studies using a PHR transaction log analysis to achieve conclusiveness and generalizability. Additionally, future studies should address not only diverse real-time user groups, but also various PHR data sources and their presentation issues. Originality/value: This study model offers an important perspective on PHIM and its causal pathway for use not only by patient educators and healthcare providers but also information providers, personal health record (PHR) system developers, and PHR users.

Supported by three different case studies, the research focuses on the different factors that affect crowdsourcing for open innovation. Moreover, the findings give us a proposed managerial framework to be considered when adopting crowdsourcing in addition to factors that proved its huge effect on crowdsourcing activities. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative research approach for this research was the most convenient. It focuses on providing an in-depth understanding of the phenomena. Qualitative research represents the views and perspectives of the participants in a study besides it is driven by a desire to explain these events, through existing or emerging concepts (Yin, 2016). Adopting a case study research method that investigates a contemporary phenomenon (the case) in depth and within its real-world context, especially when the boundaries between phenomenon and context may not be evident (Yin, 2018) as in crowdsourcing based business model for open innovation. Findings The researchers presented the benefits and challenges when considering crowdsourcing establishing a managerial framework for open innovation. Additionally, the researchers identified the different factors that highly affect crowdsourcing proposing a model that can be used for adopting crowdsourcing. The research also presented insights about how crowdsourcing was introduced in the Egyptian market and how it evolved through the years. Research limitations/implications The study had some limitations to be considered in the following work. Company X used crowdsourcing within a high degree of limitations and confidentially consequently, restricting the effects and results of crowdsourcing. Another limitation was that the study has been only qualitative, and the addition of the quantitative approach will numerically support the findings. Moreover, the research depended on the businesses only as of the source of information and neglected the crowd sample. Practical implications The main aim of this study was to address the lack of research evidence on what it means to adopt crowdsourcing for open innovation in Egyptian firms. The authors have done so by adopting three case studies which enabled them to directly observe and report on the daily work of trust CEOs, with special attention to the practices. Whereby, these executives made themselves knowledgeable for all practical purposes, as dictated by their specific job. Accordingly, the first major contribution of the present research is that it provides much-needed empirical data on the actual practices of crowdsourcing in three Egyptian, yet international companies. Moreover, the results could be used as a guideline when considering crowdsourcing activities highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of such activities. Originality/value The paper discusses different perspectives of crowdsourcing presenting a new categorization for its types. Moreover, how these types have been used especially in the Egyptian market. On the other hand, the paper investigated and documented three different sized companies' experiences utilizing crowdsourcing for innovation. The collected information was used to suggest a new model by which companies can avoid the difficulties others had. Moreover, the research highlighted the benefits and challenges of using crowdsourcing for open innovation.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/AJB-08-2020-0126,WOS,Journal

Thus, the IEs will gain a better understanding and vision of their decision-making processes in this era. Design/methodology/approach To do this, the authors first created a list of barriers to entry for IEs into Iran's rising economy's agrifood industry. Following that, a multi-layer decision-making approach was developed and implemented to accomplish the research objectives. The first stage utilized a hybrid of interpretive structural modelling (ISM) and cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC) to depict the level-based conceptual model and classification of the IEs' obstacles to entry into the agrifood sector. Following that, a hybrid decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), and analytic network process (ANP) called DANP was utilized to present a causal relationship between the barriers, identify their causes and effects, and also quantify the relevance of each barrier. Findings After employing the multi-layer decision-making approach, the results demonstrated that fundamental limitations, including infrastructure and technology limitations, are the most critical barriers alongside policy factors encompassing governmental support and access to global or regional economy/market. According to the results, innovation and economic sustainability of the agrifood supply chain also matter. All of these critical barriers are intertwined and should be planned and solved simultaneously. Furthermore, based on DANP results, the sustainability pillars (economy, environment, society), besides the low efficiency of the agrifood sector in Iran, should be investigated further for future policy makings. Originality/value A hybrid multi-layer decision-making approach has been used for analysing the barriers of investment in the agrifood sector of the emerging economy of Iran for the international entrepreneurs.

Academic circles have also carried out scene-related research to form their own definitions and theories. With the continuous innovation of technical means, the connotation of a scene is constantly enriched, from the face-to-face physical space dimension to the multi-dimensional information space, and gradually evolved into the scene characteristics of spatio-temporal integration. However, there is still a lack of complete theoretical research and practical discussion on what is the scene, what are the elements of the scene, and how to combine the specific scene to guide and carry out the scene planning and design in different fields. The existing scene theory cannot be well applied in the field of urban development, and cannot help the scene related research of coordinated development of urban agglomeration. By combing the development context of scene theory at home and abroad, this study makes an in-depth interpretation and analysis of the connotation and characteristics of the scene. It is believed that the scene contains six characteristic elements, such as time, space, object, problem, path and value. The scene is a kind of specific interactive relationship formed by a series of actions, based on the key issues and objectives of the events under specific spatio-temporal conditions, with technology and resources as the media. The construction of the scene can meet the needs of stakeholders and create and realize value. The theoretical system of scene planning including scene elements, scene hierarchy characteristics and scene planning methods is constructed. It is considered that scene planning is a systematic process to realize specific social, economic or ecological functions and values by integrating existing resources and technologies to carry out scene construction and design, focusing on key issues and objectives with stakeholders as its center, under the environmental factors of social and economic development, government policies and technological innovation. From the perspectives of scene recognition, scene construction, scene evaluation and scene application, the new exploration of scene planning tools is realized to guide scene practice in different fields. Taking the coordinated development of urban agglomeration in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area as an example, this study excavates the current problems and development objectives of the Greater Bay Area based on the scene planning method, identifies 100 important scene units representing the coordinated development direction of urban agglomeration in the Greater Bay Area, and identifies and analyzes each scene element for these scene units, so as to provide basic support for further scene construction. Finally, taking the ecological corridor construction of urban agglomeration in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area as an application example, the scene planning method is preliminarily applied to analyze the scene elements, so as to provide a basis for the next practical exploration work such as scene evaluation and scene application demonstration. The theoretical system of scene planning is not only a further extension of the scene concept, but also an overall coordination tool to promote the coordinated development of urban agglomeration. It can provide theoretical basis and practical guidance for the future scene research on the coordinated development of urban agglomeration, and help the collaborative construction of urban agglomeration. In the future, it is suggested to carry out specific scene analysis and scene design on the industry, population, transportation, environment, infrastructure and public services of the GBA urban agglomeration, and gradually realize the in-depth exploration of the coordinated development theory and mechanism innovation of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area through the scene planning theory.

Design/methodology/approach Direct and mediating hypotheses are examined through an empirical investigation of 156 CEOs in internationalised Spanish companies, using structural equation modelling validated by factor analysis. Findings The results suggest that exploitation (EI) and exploration (ER) constitute important learning mechanisms that impact on the liability of foreignness when internationalising a business. In particular, the positive influence that HHS has in international firm performance (IP) depends on both exploitative and exploratory learning. Practical implications This research adds insights into the importance of two of the main components of organisational learning (i.e. ER and EI) as mediators of the HHS and IP relationship, which can help senior managers or business owners make consistent decisions by matching potential international market locations with firm learning factors. Originality/value This study clarifies contradictory theoretical assertions and mixed empirical results about how HHS impacts on international performance. In particular, by responding to recent calls for research, this study has shown that organisational learning is a key component in the aforementioned link where ER and EI positively mediate this relevant relationship.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EBR-09-2019-0238,WOS,Journal

It builds on the DS and modularity literature to map the strategic trajectories of product-service-software (PSSw) configurations. Design/methodology/approach The study is exploratory and based on the inductive theory building method. The empirical data were gathered through a workshop with focus groups of 15 servitization manufacturers (with 22 respondents), an on-site workshop (in-depth case study), semi-structured interviews, observations and document study of archival data. Findings The DS trajectories are idiosyncratic and dependent on design architectures of PSSw modules, balancing choices between standardization and innovation. The adoption of software systems depends on the maturity of the industry-specific digital ecosystem. Decomposition and integration of PSSw modules facilitate DS transition through business model modularity. Seven testable propositions are presented. Research limitations/implications With the small sample size from different industries and one in-depth case study, generalizing the findings was not possible. Practical implications The mapping exercise is powerful when top management from different functional departments can participate together to share their expertise and achieve consensus.

It helps to reveal the organizational innovation developed by Chinese firms in coping with international competition and technological challenges. Design/methodology/approach The study uses a qualitative method of research. The evidences are mainly collected through interviews, field observation and document analysis. Findings A pattern of engineer-centered organization is the source of competitiveness of Nanrui (NR) Electric (NREC) in this study. The firm equips its front project teams, and now its overseas branches with developmental human resources and authorizes them the power of decision-making to leverage R&D projects. It is an emerging challenge to the traditional multi-national companies (MNC) pattern, and enables the Chinese firms to build their capabilities on context-based knowledge. Research limitations/implications As a single-case study paper, there are limitations about the external validity of its argument. Through the in-depth discussion of the NREC case, this paper aims to generate some clues for future study in the relevant academic community, which can be a useful step to formal theorizing and modeling. That is why the authors develop the paper on a single case. As future directions of research, comparative studies covering more cases not only within the power system control and protection industry but also among different complex technology products industrial sectors are really needed. Practical implications For innovative firms from developing countries like China, they need to develop institutional arrangements to incentivize engineers in the frontline, which may help them to build competence upon successful interaction with customers. During the era of globalization, such a pattern may generate special competitiveness over giant multi-nationals or global production networks (GPNs).

Learning in this context is defined as the need to understand key concepts (threshold) to engage with the academic content of the course. This learning journey is moulded by their experiences not only within the context of the third-level institution but is also moulded by their experiences in work placement. Threshold concepts and the inherent troublesome knowledge associated with them represent significant barriers to transformational learning. This research uses a case study approach in the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology to explore final year business information systems (BIS) undergraduate students' understanding of information systems (IS). This research objective was developed following a comprehensive review of the literature which determined that there was a research gap in understanding how BIS students encountered and overcame threshold concepts and troublesome knowledge when learning about IS. The research objective was investigated using several research questions which were explored using a mixed-method approach combining lecturer interviews, a student questionnaire and a student focus group. The study adopts a social constructivist research approach encompassing four theories of learning which act as theoretical lenses: threshold concepts, troublesome knowledge, socio-cultural development and communities of practice. The findings reveal that the students find the theory, and terminology associated with technical aspects, used within the discipline relating to learning about IS challenging. Specific threshold concepts and troublesome knowledge associated with these concepts are identified under several headings. Additionally, it emerged that the students use specific coping mechanisms to assist them in their transformational journey to understand IS which include peer learning, independent learning, practical application, lecturer support, experience and language, work placement mentor support and work-place-based learning. Finally, the results suggest that IS, as social systems, constitute a threshold concept whereby the students struggle with the following troublesome knowledge considerations in their communities of practice: communication, ethics and social system versus technical system differentiation. The study concludes by offering recommendations on how third-level education institutes can enhance awareness of threshold concepts and troublesome to limit their impact on students' transformational learning experiences.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03323315.2022.2061560,WOS,Journal

Moreover, the study provides an understanding of the mediating effect of critical success factors (CSFs) for effective IT-enabled KM on the previously mentioned relationship. Design/methodology/approach: The respondents in the study involved employees in the software engineering (SE) organizations in national capital region in India. The structured equation modeling technique carried out through IBM.SPSS.Amos.v21-EQUiNOX was used to develop and evaluate the proposed framework. The proposed hypothesis testing has been carried out by path analysis using SPSS process macro. Findings: The findings of the empirical study reveal that a significant relationship exists between the variables under investigation. Moreover, it was observed that CSFs act as a mediator between PSPI and IT-enabled KM. The identified factors are associated with various aspects as managerial, infrastructure, financial, systems and processes for IT-enabled KM. IT acts as a moderator between KM and PSPI and facilitate the various phases of KM as knowledge creation, storage and retrieval, sharing and application of knowledge. Practical implications: The present study introduces a framework for identifying and applying the CSFs that influence the KM initiatives for PSPI in an SE organization. The practitioners can use the CSFs for assessing the performance (strengths and weaknesses) in process of software development and KM practices. Researchers can use the resultant framework proposed in the empirical study for PSPI, IT-enabled KM, and in academia, the framework supports to organize the study of IT-enabled KM for PSPI. Originality/value: The general comprehension of the relationship between IT-enabled KM and PSPI for Indian SE organizations is scarce in the literature.

(2021),Knowledge spillover driven by institutions: evidence from the big science project in China,JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT,,10.1108/JKM-11-2019-0675,"Purpose This study aims to explore the knowledge spillover mechanism in big science projects (BSP) from an institutional perspective by elaborating on the dynamic relationship between institutional dualism and legitimacy. Design/methodology/approach The study conducts an exploratory research and adopts the grounded theory methodology in the context of BSP. Data draw mainly upon nine semi-structured interviews. Findings The knowledge spillovers in BSP are driven by institutions, which work through mechanisms of legitimacy perception. Formal and informal institutions influence organizational and individual behavior through legitimacy pressure and support. Formal institutions impose legitimacy pressure on organizations and individuals, forcing them to cooperate closely to solve problems; informal institutions enable them to adopt innovative strategies and positive attitudes through legitimacy support; all these promote knowledge spillovers in research and development (R&D) activities, engineering practice and regional interaction. Knowledge spillovers enable stakeholders to realize their R&D advancement, manufacturing promotion and management sophistication. Further, regional knowledge diffusion and culture transmission promote regional innovation and social capital accumulation. Research limitations/implications The study develops a theoretical model that shows how knowledge spillover mechanisms happen in BSP from an institutional perspective (the trigger, the channels/process and the impacts). More specifically, this explanation is provided by explaining how formal and informal institutions influence organizational and individual behavior through legitimacy perceptions. Practical implications First, policymakers should recognize and value the guiding, supporting and coordinating role of formal institutions and enrich capital forms to release the legitimacy pressure of stakeholders. Second, management of BSP needs to be capable of coordinating stakeholder relationships and interactions, while management should focus their attention on fostering good organizational routines and shared group value. Third, the local culture and customs should be taken into consideration since it can be an enabling or constraining of BSP. Finally, industries can take advantage of the opportunity to coordinate their R&D efforts to gain competitiveness. Originality/value First, the authors introduce the institutional perspective to analyze the construction process of BSP, which helps to better understand the interactions of stakeholders under the influence of institutions, the dynamic process and impacts of knowledge spillovers. Second, the authors are committed to contributing to the development of knowledge spillover theories by adopting an institutional perspective. The authors furthermore explore and propose the presence of a dynamic mechanism between institutional dualism and knowledge spillovers. In consequence, the authors introduce the concept of legitimacy perceptions, which is a bridge to understanding the interaction between them. Third, by explicitly discussing the actual meaning of our framework, the authors explore the unique potential of institutional arrangement in promoting the knowledge management of complex cross-border cooperation, while seeking to promote its management and administrative practices.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JKM-11-2019-0675,WOS,Journal

This awareness is increasing in each discipline, Design is also assuming this perspective. Within a design-driven context, the interdisciplinary approach has been extended even further by introducing digital fabrication tools and processes. The integration of digital fabrication in product development practices doesn't impact only on manufacturing processes, but potentially affects all stages of the industry, from design to consumption. The necessity to explore potentials and limits of the technology is requiring an iterative definition of new methodologies, blurring the boarders between disciplines and performing practical and inclusive paths. This kind of approach is experienced within Fab Labs, networked and distributed laboratories equipped with a common set of digital fabrication tools supported by a global creative community, built upon knowledge sharing programs, peer to peer education, and access. The diffusion of urban collaborative spaces allowing users to prototype personal and professional solutions [1,2], are fostering the rise of new business models based on digital craftmanship, on-demand and tailored production [3], and distributed manufacturing. Within this evolving context, the role of educational institutions should be to catch and explore innovation potentials from emerging realities, in order to train professionals capable of overseeing these new practices, being ready to cope with updated market dynamics. Through approaches driven by Project Based Learning (PBL) [4] and learning by doing, it is possible to face this complexity, breaking down challenges in circumscribed frameworks without reducing or limiting the scope of research. In view of this analysis, the paper will present a pilot educational experience, that has been prototyped within the Master of Science Course Design for the Fashion System of Politecnico di Milano, which aimed at (a) training designers in understanding the impact of digital fabrication technologies in modifying and implementing fashion design practices, (b) testing the integration of knowledge and skills from different professional figures involved in the management and proposal of an interdisciplinary project, (c) evaluating the potential of digital fabrication technologies in fashion practices, by assessing their effect on product and process innovation. In particular, the pilot has been performed as a workshop involving twelve students, and lead by a senior fashion designer, a digital fabrication expert, and a facilitator. The pilot's experience included students' self-assessment and reflection on the process carried out, built on the model usually adopted to document hands-on activities within Fab Labs. An assessment phase conducted by the facilitator followed, in order to validate the PBL model and improve it in anticipation of being repurposed in future didactic experiences.",2019,,WOS,Conference Paper

Design/methodology/approach: With a questionnaire survey of 317 senior and middle managers from different firms in China, structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesized conceptual model, and bootstrapping method was employed to examine the multiple mediating effects. Findings: Results indicate that EL has a significant and positive effect on adaptive innovation. This relationship is partially mediated through exploitative learning, exploratory learning, resource bricolage and boundary-spanning integration, respectively. The impact of EL on adaptive innovation is also sequentially transmitted through exploitative learning and resource bricolage or exploratory learning and boundary-spanning integration. Originality/value: Adaptive innovation has become a firm competition strategy to cope with dynamic changes in current uncertain environment where EL can play its effectiveness to engage firms in such innovation activities. However, the question of why and how EL drives adaptive innovation has yet to be discussed. This study highlights the innovation effectiveness of EL and the triggering process of adaptive innovation, and contributes to several countermeasures for firms to implement leadership and innovation practices responding to uncertain environment.

Design/methodology/approach: This study used a combination of in-depth interviews and large-scale surveys in 15 enterprises in the North, Central and South of Vietnam. In total, 455 valid questionnaires from employees of information technology, telecommunications and e-commerce enterprises have been used in this research to explore the impact of transformational leadership (TL), coworker support (CS) and organizational learning (OL) on employees' IB. The data collected were subjected to quantitative analysis, including Cronbach's alpha reliability test, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) for scales and hypotheses testing. Findings: The results show that there are positive relationships between TL, OL and employees' IB, in which OL has a stronger impact than TL. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of this paper are that other factors affecting the innovation behavior of employees in Vietnamese enterprises have not been fully explored, the rejection of the hypothesis about the relationship between CS and employeesâ€™ IB needs to be considered with the moderating role of job characteristics and the use of convenient random sample selection, due to which its reliability may not be guaranteed. Practical implications: From the results of this study, the authors point out that managers in Vietnamese enterprises should develop TL to deliver more creativity in an organization and enhance the corporate learning-oriented environment.

The authors propose a theoretical framework to illustrate the effect of relational capital on three dimensions of collaboration and radical and incremental innovation. Design/methodology/approach: The paper has a quantitative approach. The authors conducted the survey to collect the data from 225 suppliers in the Hunan province of China. The proposed model is tested with exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling. Findings: The findings show that relational capital can facilitate information sharing and benefit/risk sharing when firms work together to achieve innovation. Furthermore, the results indicate that relational capital leads to radical innovation through facilitating information sharing among firms and helps in generating incremental innovation by encouraging firms to share risks and benefits with their partners. Practical implications: The findings of this study give some suggestions for managers of the firms in terms of building their collaborative strategies. Managers should exploit relational capital to build successful and long-term collaboration. Also, through relational capital, managers can share information to create radical innovation or pool risks and share benefits with their customers to achieve incremental innovation.

Similarly, eco-innovation is being recognized as one of the most important mechanisms that allow the transition from a linear to a circular economy in production processes, as there is a strong relationship between eco-innovation (eco-innovation of products, processes and management) and circular economy activities. However, the relationship between eco-innovation and circular economy is an issue that has been isolated and little analyzed in the academic literature. Therefore, this research fills this gap by exploring the interdependence between eco-innovation and circular economy. Design/methodology/approach The research is conducted through an extensive literature review from where a research framework consisting of two measurement scales, 18 items and three hypotheses were developed. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed and 460 responses were obtained from companies in the automotive and auto parts industry in Mexico.

The concept of outcomes-based education (OBE) was first put forward in 1981 by the educator W. Spady, and has been widely valued and applied in a rapid speed. During the next 10 years, OBE has formed a relatively complete theoretical system and became the mainstream ideas of national education reform in the United States, Britain, Canada and other counties. At present, the technology and tools of OBE, despite the criticism, remain relevant for the development and optimisation of the humanities education system. The aim of the present research is to study and analyse the theory of OBE and the practice on the application of pedagogical principles for modernisation of the humanities education in China. Results and scientific novelty. Chinese education certification system has made notable progress in recent years. More universities and colleges are pursuing a quality improvement strategy focused on three main components - learning outcomes, student personality and continuous improvement. OBE establishes the same priorities; OBE is considered as a special type of effective pedagogical design. The features of this model implementation are briefly described - the structure of the training process, its stages and characteristics. The opportunities for improving humanities education based on OBE framework were considered. The OBE operates within the framework of the following core issues: the things students learn and the extent of student success, not the manner of learning; the place, the time of learning and the duration of training. OBE process implies ultimate involvement of students' individual cognitive abilities to master competencies, which help adapt to future life. The knowledge of actual material (content of the programme) is not the key element of the education process, but the skills of knowledge application are important when solving specific tasks. The curricula, educational process, its methods, tools are adjusted, rebuilt and replaced if they do not contribute to the development of such skills, e. g. the results of the training determine its system and act not as a goal, but as a means of achieving it. The structure of results manages all educational activities, and their evaluation is carried out according to clear initially defined criteria, combined with flexible personalised requirements in order to get students to fully self-realise personal potential during a training course. To improve the initial design of curriculum, it is necessary to provide constant feedback student-teacher. The teacher has to organise and focus the learning process to give each student confidence in the acquired experience and to guarantee his or her success in further professional activities and life in general. Practical significance. The OBE concept fully complies with the needs and demands of modern society and modern people - it is no coincidence that such training has become one of the most popular forms of education in many countries, including the field of the humanities education in China. The present research leads to the conclusion that in the humanities field, notably in the teaching of foreign languages, a significant improvement in the quality of training of students can be achieved through the use of OBE teaching tools. In this model of training, practice is more important than theory. Moreover, this model assumes understanding to be more valuable than memory; the traditional cramming of educational information by students can be completely excluded; also, such model provides an opportunity to establish a continuous productive dialogue between the participants of educational process and to transform a classroom into a laboratory. The student becomes an active, self-motivated and responsible actor of his or her own individual educational trajectory, not a passive consumer of information, and the teacher - active assistant and coordinator of education.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.17853/1994-5639-2020-2-77-96,WOS,Journal

The authors responded to employers of engineering and built environment graduates observing limited real-life problem-solving skills, beyond using established formulae and methods, in spite of attempts over more than two decades, to train engineers and other built environment disciplines in areas such as whole system design and sustainable design. Design/methodology/approach A grounded theory approach was used to guide the analysis of data collected through ethnographic methods. The process involved reflecting on authors' efforts to develop context appreciation within a course called International Engineering Practice, using two years of collected data (archived course information, including course profile; completed assessment; lecture and field visit evaluations; and focus groups). The study is built on the authors' working knowledge of Bloom's Taxonomy and Threshold Learning Theory, and the well-established role of context appreciation in complex problem-solving. After the first iteration of the course, the authors looked for additional theoretical support to help explain findings. The Cynefin framework was subsequently used to augment the authors' appreciation of context - beyond physical context to include relational context, and to evaluate students' competency development across the four domains of clear, complicated, complex and chaotic. Findings This study helped the authors to understand that there was increased capacity of the students to distinguish between three important contexts for problem-solving, including an increased awareness about the importance of factual and relevant information, increased acknowledgement of the varying roles of professional practitioners in problem-solving depending on the type of problem and increased appreciation of the importance of interdisciplinary teams in tackling complex and complicated problems. There were several opportunities for such courses to be more effective in preparing students for dealing with chaotic situations that are prevalent in addressing the United Nations' 17 sustainable development goals (UNSDGs). Drawing on the course-based learnings, the authors present a context integration model for developing problem-solving knowledge and skills. Research limitations/implications The research findings are important because context appreciation - including both physical context and relational context - is critical to problem-solving for the UNSDGs, including its 169 targets and 232 indicators. The research findings highlight the opportunity for the Cynefin framework to inform holistic curriculum renewal processes, enhancing an educator's ability to design, implement and evaluate coursework that develops physical and relational context appreciation. Practical implications The study's findings and context integration model can help educators develop the full range of necessary problem-solving graduate competencies, including for chaotic situations involving high degrees of uncertainty. Looking ahead, acknowledging the significant carbon footprint of global travel, the authors are interested in applying the model to a domestic and/or online format of the same course, to attempt similar learning outcomes. Originality/value Connecting Bloom's taxonomy deep learning and threshold learning theory critical path learning insights with the Cynefin framework context domains, provides a novel model to evaluate competency development for problem-solving towards improved holistic physical and relational context appreciation outcomes.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJSHE-01-2020-0024,WOS,Journal

The quest for a lasting solution to these problems is heralding the change toward offsite construction. Amid the scaling drive, to date there are no official reports and contribution to knowledge on the drivers of offsite construction in Ghana. This study models the structural paths of the critical drivers of offsite construction in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected through a questionnaire from 95 respondents in the Ghanaian construction industry. Exploratory factor analysis and Partial least squares structural equation modeling were employed to analyze the data. Findings The results revealed that industry dynamics are the governing drivers of offsite construction in Ghana. As such, factors such as the rocketing housing deficits, high cost of acquiring land permanently, high cost of cast-in-situ construction, the utilization of prefabricated shipping containers for construction and construction market demand constitute the governing drivers of offsite construction in Ghana. Similarly, concern for higher productivity is a critical driver of offsite construction in the Ghanaian construction industry. On the contrary, findings show that performance-related drivers, government policy and regulation, and technological innovation exert little influence in driving offsite construction in Ghana. Practical implications The appreciation of the drivers may help stakeholders to understand the important mechanisms underlying offsite construction in Ghana, and thereafter help them to make more informed decisions regarding its implementation. Originality/value The findings contribute some interesting dimensions to the global debate on offsite construction by discovering and adding two drivers of offsite construction peculiar to developing countries (high cost of acquiring land permanently, and the utilization of shipping containers for construction) to the literature.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/BEPAM-03-2021-0051,WOS,Journal

Action learning provides a strong guarantee that for the implementation of bottleneck breakthrough program, programming and action learning are required to continually solve problems and achieve goals in the process. Research limitations/implications â€“ The authors used inward manufacturing small- and medium-sized enterprises as research subjects The authors did not analysis the role of knowledge services; the future studies could explore how to improve the performance through the transformation value co-creation. Practical implications â€“ Because of the lack of resources and capacity, small- and medium-sized enterprise adopt appropriate micro-innovation and continuous micro-transformation to break the bottleneck stage and achieve small victories.

It is to a great extent driven by a large number of latecomers who effectively pursued the initial technological catch-up under the model of â€œsecondary innovationâ€. However, how latecomers could get rid of the trap of â€œcatch-upâ€”fall-behindâ€”catch-upâ€ and cross towards â€œbeyondâ€ is a hot topic, gaining great concern in the field of both theory and practice. The existed literatures rarely discuss the innovation strategy in the late catch-up phase, especially in the period of paradigm shift. Besides, the technological, market and institutional environment in China have undergone tremendous changes, and latecomers located in the late catch-up phase have already accumulated a great amount of different resources and capabilities, compared with those located in the early catch-up stage. Therefore, it calls for scholars to systematically and deeply analyze the innovation mode and path of latecomers in the late catch-up period, in order to fill the research gap and provide better guidance to firms developing from catch-up to beyond. Based on the realistic and theoretical background, the first two sections of this paper review the general catch-up path of latecomers and the ""dynamic model of secondary innovation"" which is proposed from the context of China. It is different from the famous ""U-A model"" developed from western developed economies. Specifically, the ""dynamic model of secondary innovation"" emphasizes the importance of the â€œwindow of opportunityâ€ in the period of technology paradigm shift for latecomers, and shows the whole developing process of secondary innovation based on the introduction of mature technology and emerging technology to independent innovation. This paper summarized the changes in strategic environment faced by Chinese enterprises in new era: the shortening lifecycle and the increase of uncertainty of technological development, the disappearance of demographic dividend and the emergence of talent dividend, the rapid rise of the middle class, and the transformation of institution from encouraging technology introduction to emphasizing the breakthrough of key technology as well as the layout of National Innovation System. Then in the fourth section, we critically re-examine the traditional strategic management theory in the new ""paradigm shift"" environment. The paper points out that the importance of paying attention to the power of the complementary, overcoming the inertia resources & abilities, and the existing path dependence, as well as paying more attention to the ""gray"" management based on the ""ambidextrous thinking"". Based on the systematic analysis of the current strategic environment and the in-depth thinking of the strategic management theory, the innovation strategy of ""Beyond catch-up"" in the process of nonlinear chaos is put forward. Specifically, ""Beyond catch-up"" refers to an innovation model in which an organization, with its own capability and the support from complementors, pays attention to ""gray"" management that emphasizes both ""exploitation"" and ""exploration"" in R&D, gets rid of the restriction of the existing technology paradigm, and seeks for revolutionary innovative development with a higher, broader and more forward-looking vision and layout in an open and changing context. On the basis of case analysis, the paper brings forward three main models of ""Beyond catch-up"", that is, the ""Beyond catch-up"" model led by technology innovation, led by business model innovation and the integrated models driven by both technology innovation and business model innovation. It is particularly worth mentioning that in the innovation strategy of ""Beyond catch-up"", the development of the innovation ability of latecomers is not only passively following the technological path determined by the technological paradigm of industry leaders, on the contrary, the cross-border innovation ability will promote the latecomers to develop the new technological paradigm in collaboration with business model innovation. During the paradigm shift in which technology, markets, and institutions have undergone tremendous changes, we should rethink the applicability of traditional theories, explore the characteristics and patterns of latecomersâ€™ catch-up. The innovation strategy of â€œBeyond catch-upâ€ is of great practical significance and theoretical value to guide more enterprises to correctly understand and grasp the important window of opportunity when the next paradigm emerges, realize the role transformation from follower to leader, and lead more enterprises and even the whole society to develop more sustainably and healthily.

A significant and robust effect resulted from collaboration and integration as major mechanisms influence opportunities, problems and solutions within construction firms using IPD, marking a future trend. Reports further substantiate the importance and focus on collaboration and integration between IPD practitioners. With the same dynamic and gradual prominence, building information modeling (BIM) and new technology applications demonstrated the importance of the development and diffusion of IPD in the form of, for example, digital government initiatives. It is expected that the trend for IDS and resource mobilization functions will continue to grow - clear evidence of the benefits of the IPD approach in the construction sector. New evidence for gaining cognitive and normative legitimacy emerged. The expansion of new avenues for further legitimation is expected to enable growth. Research limitations/implications Beyond the innovative approach of viewing IPD from the emerging innovation framework, the research presented fully contributes to IPD literature, providing a comprehensive state-of-the-art status and a quantitative analysis of IPD scientific output, thereby illuminating promising work areas for future research into IPD. The main limitation is related to the dynamic process of indexing of IPD literature in the WoS and SD - although many new research publications are added in the discipline, only a part of them have been indexed in the WoS and SD core database. Practical implications The study revealed key evolving trends within the field, including instructive findings and implications concerning possible deficiencies. Based on factors from network visualizations and quantitative evaluation from major influential articles, journals and authors, future critical IPD implementation focus will be on BIM and sustainability concepts - centerpiece concepts for the evolving line of IPD growth and development in the architecture, engineering and construction industry. Social implications This study fills the gap created in a shortage of studies mapping out the most critical contributions in journals, authors and research perspectives related to IPD. It presents a framework that can be used as an objective procedure to evaluate the topic. It is expected that the study will serve as a cornerstone for researchers in this field, as it provides a bibliometric analysis and presents trends using an analytical framework of innovation. Originality/value The research presented is a keystone in the foundation of the literature review on this topic. The research draws on an existing framework for innovation - the TIS, developed from innovation studies using a robust theoretical framework to enable further analysis of IPD. This approach is one of a kind, using the results of scientometric analysis to study the scientific landscape and knowledge output of IPD in the AEC community. Science-mapping bibliometric analysis was conducted to shed light on IPD trends and explain factors that back or support the development and diffusion of IPD, including shaping and enabling evolution and growth. The framework helps to shed light on the interaction of socio-technical structures (i.e. stakeholders, technologies and rules) embedded in the industry, which helped create, direct and advance IPD in the project delivery system.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/ECAM-06-2021-0516,WOS,Journal

However, standards system of IoT is not yet mature, existing obvious overlapping and even conflicting standards, and enterprises lack mature technology standardization model, which severely restricts the structural upgrading and development of IoT. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: In this regard, this study combs the research context of the IoT, technology standardization and competition behavior, and analyze technology standardization models of IoT by combining theory with practice. Using game theory and profit function, this paper analyzes the selection mechanism of standardization model of IoT enterprises, and explores practical application of these models using competitive behavior theory. Findings: First, in the process of standardization, technology standardization model n enterprises is not single, nor is it immutable. Second, the trend of internationalization of technical standards is becoming more and more obvious. Third, if LoT enterprises want to achieve their own technology standardization, the corresponding competitive behavior is essential. Fourth, with the change of innovation capability and market forces, the competitive behavior of enterprises should be improved accordingly to better adapt to the changes of internal and external environment and ensure the realization of the standardization of enterprises. Fifth, if IoT attempts to achieve the same globalization as the internet, there must be a set of support systems. Originality/value: Finally, some suggestions are given for the future development in the field of IoT. This study will provide some theoretical support for promoting the development of standards and enhancing the competitiveness of IoT enterprises.

Similarly, eco-innovation is being recognized as one of the most important mechanisms that allow the transition from a linear to a circular economy in production processes, as there is a strong relationship between eco-innovation (eco-innovation of products, processes and management) and circular economy activities. However, the relationship between eco-innovation and circular economy is an issue that has been isolated and little analyzed in the academic literature. Therefore, this research fills this gap by exploring the interdependence between eco-innovation and circular economy. Design/methodology/approach: The research is conducted through an extensive literature review from where a research framework consisting of two measurement scales, 18 items and three hypotheses were developed. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed and 460 responses were obtained from companies in the automotive and auto parts industry in Mexico. The data obtained were analyzed through confirmatory factor analysis, descriptive statistics and structural equation modeling. Findings: The results suggest that eco-innovation of products, process and management has a significant positive impact on the circular economy of companies in the automotive and auto parts industry. Practical implications: The findings of this research can inform managers in the automotive sector and policymakers when formulating and deploying environmentally sustainable strategies. Originality/value: This paper fills a research gap by expanding the limited body of knowledge that relates eco-innovation and circular economy and providing some evidence of their relationship. The research also allows the unique characteristics of eco-innovation and the circular economy to be understood within a particular context, growing in this manner the body of knowledge on this field.

This study explores the conceptual domain of SI leadership in HE. Drawing on the insights of 22 experienced practitioners in Canada, it provides a concept map to help guide leadership practice and research. Design/methodology/approach The study adopted Group Concept Mapping (GCM), a mixed methods approach that provides a structured way to map the conceptual domain of a topic from the perspectives of those with close knowledge of it. Using online GCM software, one group of participants generated statements in response to a prompting question about SI leadership. Another group sorted statements into conceptual groups, rating them for importance. The authors then produced a preliminary map using cluster analysis. A third group interpreted that map. The authors analyzed interpretation data to produce a final concept map, which is discussed in light of relevant literature. Findings GCM methodology resulted in 108 statements about SI leadership, with the vast majority ranked as highly important. The analysis produced a map consisting of nine clusters of conceptually related ideas about SI leadership, encapsulated under three interacting areas of focus: individual, relational, institutional/system. Participants confirmed the map reflected key dimensions of practice, noting it indicated important tensions and paradoxes core to their practice. Their interpretations highlighted how the map represented iterative dynamics of leadership over time and across levels; and how different theoretical and practice traditions in SI communities affect conceptualizations of leadership. Research limitations/implications The study suggests that an area ripe for study is the navigation of micro-level systems in pursuit of meso-level and macro-level systems change. The map provides an empirically derived set of dimensions for instrument development in future SI leadership studies. The context of conventional academic institutions bounds the results but helps to surface key considerations for researching SI processes in other mature institutions. Comparison of findings with extant leadership theories suggests that, to advance theoretical research on the topic of leadership in SI, bricolage or new theory development will be needed. Practical implications The map paints broad themes with concrete, practice-level ideas. It can serve as a touchstone for reflection by experienced practitioners and offers a reference point to orient those new to leading SI. Originality/value The scholarly knowledge base about SI has been growing rapidly, but it is still an emerging field of study. There are only a handful of published studies offering perspectives on SI in HE, and none with respect to SI leadership in HE. This study offers original conceptual insights grounded in empirical data gathered through a method aligned with its exploratory purpose.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EJIM-07-2020-0256,WOS,Journal

There are big differences in how this is done. Approaches depend on motivations and capacities of leadership. Leadership concerns itself with organizational improvement. In more precise terms, leadership concentrates on establishing widely agreed, valued and worthwhile directions (both strategic and tactical) for organization and implementation of what is required to stimulate, motivate, guide and support people to move in those directions. A generic definition of impactful and effective leadership concerns direction and influence. If stability is the goal of what is called management, improvement is the goal of leadership. Any reform creating innovative schools to meet 21st century challenges is difficult unless leaders share its aims and are prepared to make it work. Successful leadership plays a significant role in improving school reform and learning. Social change requires leadership that encapsulates vision as well as achievable practice. Leadership can effectively be investigated at intermediate levels, as it is conceptualized and developed within key frameworks: (1) Networks of educational centers, (2) Administrative coordination networks, (3) Professional bodies and associations, (4) Policy bodies. We explore such leadership, how it is productively distributed across the school system and what stimulates and sustains its development. There is strong focus on the forms of leadership most likely to foster learning and how such successful forms of leadership contribute to school reform and innovation. We describe those successful leadership practices, as well as their relationship to the school organization and to enhanced learning outcomes. Comparative analysis looks at examples in Catalonia and the United States. The research focus is on the need for new models of school organization to provide students with life skills required in the emerging knowledge society. The importance of understanding the critical role of leadership in this change process links directly to the key factors of developing networks, new structures and distributed leadership models central to the knowledge and information society.",2019,,WOS,Conference Paper

IoT is expected to play a significant role in the future industry 4.0 platform. Yet, little is known about how SMEs in the IoT industry (IoT-SMEs hereafter) pursue innovation in alignment with attributes inherent in the IoT. Design/methodology/approach - This study addresses relatively unexplored key research questions on innovation strategies of IoT-SMEs. To do so, we employ an exploratory research methodology, along with an extensive review of the literature in the areas of the IoT, SMEs innovation and sustainable growth strategy. Specifically, we conduct intensive individual interviews to find IoT inherent innovation attributes and a case study to explore the process of linking these attributes to innovation-driving paths. Findings - The analysis results reveal that there exist disruptive and open innovation attributes in the IoT industry that enable IoT-SMEs to enhance their structure and process related capabilities, to create business models for products and services and to collaborate with external parties in marketing to enter the market. We excavate practical insights into driving innovation based on IoT attributes and suggest enabling paths for pursuing innovation and entering overseas markets for IoT-SMEs. Originality/value - This study investigates an underexplored significant area of research on the relationship between IoT attributes and innovation paths. The findings provide profound theoretical and practical implications.

(2019),Entrepreneurial architecture in UK universities: still a work in progress?,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURIAL BEHAVIOR & RESEARCH,,10.1108/IJEBR-01-2017-0047,"Purpose UK higher education has faced an unprecedented period of change due to multiple UK governmental policies over a short period - coupled with demographic change and the vote to leave the European Union. This pressures universities to meet third mission aims by engaging effectively with society and business, generating income in the process to address reduced funding. Support from the UK Government includes over 20 years of funding for universities to develop entrepreneurial structures and processes, termed entrepreneurial architecture (EA). While the government regularly collects data on funds generated through third mission activities, less is known about how EA is perceived by those inside the university. The purpose of this paper is to meet that gap by exploring the perspectives of those employed specifically as part of EA implementation, as knowledge exchange intermediaries. Design/methodology/approach The study takes a phenomenological approach to achieve deeper insights into those routines and norms resulting from the application of EA. This is a purposeful sample with what is reported to be an under-researched group (Hayter, 2016); those employed as internal knowledge intermediaries across 15 universities (two from each). These university employees are specifically charged with business engagement, knowledge exchange and research commercialization; their contracts are funded and designed as a part of the EA rather than for research or teaching. An initial pilot comprising four semi-structured interviews indicated suitable themes. This was followed up through a set of three interviews over 18 months with each participant and a mapping of EA components at each institution. Findings Despite EA strategies, the picture emerging was that universities had embedded physical components to a greater or lesser degree without effective social architecture, shown by conflicts between stated and actual routines and norms and by consistent barriers to third mission work. Power and perceived power were critical as participants felt their own worth and status was embedded in their senior manager's status and power, with practical difficulties for them when he or she lost ground due to internal politics. Research limitations/implications - The benefits of this study method and sample include deep insights into the perspectives of an under-reported group. The purposeful sample might be usefully expanded to include other countries, other staff or to look in depth at one institution. It is a qualitative study so brings with it the richness, insights and the potential lack of easy generalizability such an approach provides. Practical implications - In designing organizations to achieve third mission aims, EA is important. Even where the structures, strategies, systems, leadership and culture appear to be in place; however, the resulting routines and norms may act against organizational aims. Those designing and redesigning their institutions might look at the experience suggested here to understand how important it is to embed social architecture to ensure effective actions. Measuring cultures and having this as part of institutional targets might also support better results. Social implications - Governments in the UK have invested resources and funding and produced policy documents related to the third mission for over 20 years. However, the persistent gap in universities delivering on policy third mission aims is well documented. For this to change, universities will need to ensure their EA is founded on strong underlying supportive cultures. Knowledge sharing with business and community is unlikely when it does not happen in-house. Originality/value - The study adds new knowledge about how EA is expressed at individual university level. The findings show the need for more research to understand those routines and norms which shape third mission progress in UK universities and how power relations impact in this context, given the pivotal role of the power exerted by the senior manager.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJEBR-01-2017-0047,WOS,Journal

Design/methodology/approach With a questionnaire survey of 317 senior and middle managers from different firms in China, structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesized conceptual model, and bootstrapping method was employed to examine the multiple mediating effects. Findings Results indicate that EL has a significant and positive effect on adaptive innovation. This relationship is partially mediated through exploitative learning, exploratory learning, resource bricolage and boundary-spanning integration, respectively. The impact of EL on adaptive innovation is also sequentially transmitted through exploitative learning and resource bricolage or exploratory learning and boundary-spanning integration. Originality/value Adaptive innovation has become a firm competition strategy to cope with dynamic changes in current uncertain environment where EL can play its effectiveness to engage firms in such innovation activities.

Prior research have drawn its research attention to technological innovation and focussed on the biopharmaceutical and technological sectors as the main research contexts. Thus, to gain a wider picture of the structural characteristics of innovation ecosystem, this paper aims to complement the existing technological-centred literature and provides understanding of aesthetic innovation by focussing on exploring the role of actors and intermediaries in either facilitating or inhibiting innovation in the creative sector. Design/methodology/approach This is an exploratory study and the qualitative method was employed. With aim to explore aesthetic innovation in the creative sector, this research grounded its context in the UK designer fashion sector, which is part of the creative industries. Data were collected through a series of semi-structured interviews with respondents being purposely selected so as to ensure representativeness. A wider range of participants within the designer fashion sector was covered. Such multiple-sourced data collection approach allowed this research to triangulate data so that research trustworthiness was enhanced. Findings The result suggests the role of a broker in beyond traditionally facilitating knowledge exchange. This paper provides empirical evidence regarding the critical role of a broker in shaping the open innovation mechanism when it comes to aesthetic innovation. A broker in fact occupies a strategic position that allows it to negotiate relationships among the connected organisations and thus to govern the interaction mechanism of the innovation ecosystem as a whole. Given the empowered broker in such setting, the relationship between innovation creators and innovation seekers is controlled by a broker, which leads to risk that an innovation creator may not fully appropriate the value that it creates. Research limitations/implications The main limitation of this study is its specific context, that is, the UK designer fashion industry. Such focus limits the scope of generalisation particularly its application to the entire creative sector. Thus, it is suggested that future research may consider to explore other creative industries so that the understanding of the open innovation mechanism from a structural perspective applied to aesthetic innovation can be enhanced. Originality/value This paper outlines the structural mechanism of open innovation applied to aesthetic innovation. The result contributes to the literature by complementing the findings derived from technology-centred research. Also, empirical evidence of this study is particularly of value to policy makers in the aspect of creative sector development. The suggested implications provide strategies of innovation ecosystem that could benefit individual actors involved in this open innovation setting and ensure prosper of the sector as a whole.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EJIM-09-2017-0115,WOS,Journal

Specifically, a moderated mediation model linking CEO transformational leadership to firm innovation, which includes strategic flexibility as a mediator and top management team (TMT) knowledge diversity as a moderator, is theorized and empirically tested. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a survey of 354 TMT members and 62 CEOs from 62 firms in China's construction industry to explore these relationships. Path analysis using Mplus 7.4 was undertaken to test our proposed moderated mediation model. Findings The results revealed that strategic flexibility mediates the positive relationship between CEO transformational leadership and firm innovation. Additionally, TMT knowledge diversity positively moderates the relationship between CEO transformational leadership and strategic flexibility. Research limitations/implications Taken together, these findings help advance and deepen our understanding of the mechanisms through which CEO transformational leadership influences firm innovation and boundary conditions under which CEO transformational leadership influences strategic flexibility. At the same time, this study also contributes to the literature on strategic flexibility and the CEO-TMT interface by revealing the interactive effect of CEO transformational leadership and TMT knowledge diversity on strategic flexibility. Originality/value Although the positive influence of CEO transformational leadership on firm innovation has been widely recognized, the specific mechanisms underlying this effect have yet to be fully theorized. This study proposes and tests a nuanced theoretical framework linking CEO transformational leadership to firm innovation via a firm's strategic flexibility. It also argues that TMT knowledge diversity enhances the indirect effect of CEO transformational leadership on firm innovation through strategic flexibility; that is, this indirect effect is significant when TMT diversity is high, but not when TMT diversity is low.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/CMS-10-2021-0440,WOS,Journal

Findings: The results of logistic regression show that explanatory variables are significant, providing evidence that knowledge management (KM) promotes BMI through equity investment. By further using back propagation neural network, the classification learning algorithm estimates the possibility of BMI, which can be regarded as a score to quantify the performance of knowledge-driven BMI Research limitations/implications: The quality of secondhand big data is not very ideal, and future empirical studies should use first-hand survey data. Practical implications: This study provides new insights into the link between KM and BMI by highlighting the important roles of external investments in open modes. Social implications: From the perspective of investment, the findings of this study suggest the importance for stakeholders to share knowledge and strategies for entrepreneurs to manage innovation. Originality/value: The concepts and indicators related to business models are difficult to quantify currently, while this study provides feasible and practical methods to estimate knowledge-driven BMI with secondhand data from the primary market. The mechanism of knowledge and innovation bridged by the experience from investors is introduced and analyzed.

Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) have always faced this complexity by focusing the attention to bounded areas of investigation for very specific subjects that don't really relate to each other, not considering the system as a whole. In today's transformation context, designers are trying to figure out the problem developing a new holistic vision of cognitive processes which implies an interdisciplinary teaching and learning environment. New didactical methodologies are being introduced by this changing environment such as multidisciplinary problem-centred courses with original learning formats based on experimental classes with heterogeneous working groups in the studio. Indeed, students should be able to deepen some of the actual macro trends that are challenging and revolutionizing the industry scenario. Especially for fashion, three are the main phenomena to be explored and taken on like challenges: The diffusion of sustainability issues, attempting to reduce the environmental, economic and social impact that fashion has on our planet. The effects and improvements of the digital transformation on the whole supply chain, from the products development to the retail and communication phases. The analysis of new production and consumption dynamics of the whole system (i.e. from products to services, sharing economy, social interaction & social innovation). These themes are considered like issues for today's fashion system and should be faced into the educational path of new professionals. Within this scenario a relevant role is played by universities. Students should learn in a multidisciplinary openness context, in which teaching focus shifts from product merchandise (fabrics, garments, jewellery, etc.) to innovation processes. Moreover, they should develop the ability to relate to advanced knowledge and tools, growing their attitude to continuously adapt to technological transformations and to be able to constantly learn and approach new tools. Finally, they should learn how to drive innovation through design thinking with a progressive growth of critical skills, therefore, to plan and direct complex projects in little time always taking into consideration an ethical dimension of their profession. This perspective leads to the creation of new professional profiles able to stimulate innovation in the design value chain, ethically pursuing transparency, working for a new corporate social responsibility scope. These figures should guide fashion into a new age, becoming innovation leader, being trained to catch issues and dealing with them through their design expertise, creating bridges between different disciplines, organizing competences and connecting with other fields In light of this scenario, the Design for the Fashion System Master of Science at Politecnico di Milano presents a new experimental model of the final synthesis laboratory based on this broad diversity of disciplines and principles. The paper will introduce all the multidisciplinary activities organized into the course, divided in theoretical and instrumental modules which explore advanced theories and processes, and design workshops that implement the practices related to the macro themes.",2020,,WOS,Conference Paper

Background Online and blended learning modes continue to grow in popularity in higher education, with the aim of streamlining and enhancing student learning, supporting collaboration and creativity, and equipping students with the skills they will require to work and live in an increasingly digitized world. This practice-based case study highlights factors which positively and negatively affect user engagement with digital learning objects and ex-plores students' perceptions of the role of online learning within their aca-demic programs. Methodology A suite of nine interactive e-tutorials, addressing essential digital literacy skills for university students, was developed through instructor and student peer collaboration using Articulate software, informed by best practice. The e-tutorials were embedded in the institutional Learning Management System for three undergraduate and postgraduate courses, in which digital literacy formed the core learning content, to complement classroom-based learning. Students in these courses were surveyed via SurveyMonkey about their specific experience of using the e-tutorials, as well as their general perceptions of digital literacy and online learning. Eighty-six students in total completed the questionnaire, which consisted of twenty-three closed- and open-ended questions. Contribution Through highlighting both the positive and the challenging aspects of the students' reported experience of online learning, this case study contrib-utes useful insights to the body of literature on user engagement with digi-tal learning objects in higher education, as well as students' perceptions and experience of blended learning. Findings The e-tutorials were perceived as valuable in reinforcing classroom learn-ing, allowing respondents to revise concepts and materials covered in face-to-face classes, at their own pace and in their own time. Survey responses showed that the accessibility, ease-of-use, design and duration of the e-tutorials were deemed effective in terms of user engagement; however, several technological challenges were identified, such as browser incompat-ibility, uneven sound quality and general Internet connection issues, which disrupted their learning. Overall, students expressed enjoyment of the learning facilitated by the e-tutorials; however, rather than favoring online learning alone, they expressed a preference for a blended learning envi-ronment, with a combination of complementary learning approaches; sur-vey respondents did not generally wish to forego face-to-face classes en-tirely. Recommendations for Practitioners Instructors should seek to strategically embed interactive digital learning objects in their courses at defined points of need in a logical structure, e.g., to reinforce classroom-based learning, or to support specific skill develop-ment. Potential disruption to learning should be minimized by following best practice guidelines to ensure ease of access, a seamless user experi-ence, and timely feedback, as well as providing adequate support for rapid resolution of technical glitches. Recommendations for Researchers E-tutorials offer a useful means of exploring ways in which students ac-quire learning in the digital environment. A wider, collaborative exploration is needed to provide comparative studies which move beyond case studies. Impact on Society Online learning mechanisms, such as e-tutorials, offer students different means of acquiring essential literacy skills and different ways to interact with content. E-tutorials constitute reusable learning objects, which can be accessed as just-in-time delivery modes, when students perceive they need to review particular skills or reinforce learning material. Future Research This research is now expanding into different types of reusable learning objects. E-tutorials may be developed in multiple ways, and comparative research around e-tutorial models will deepen our understanding of how students interact with content in formal learning contexts. As the digital educational landscape continues to expand alongside traditional face-to-face and analogue learning modes, a key research focus will be student and instructor perceptions and experience of blended learning in different con-texts.

It is established that organizations can enhance their performance via process and product innovation; however, the psychological foundations of TI, and the way this affects employees, are underexplored in the organization and management literature. Drawing on organismic integration theory, we aim to enrich the field of innovation and employee branding studies by examining the role of innovation capabilities in employees' motivation at work and wellbeing, which results in employee brand ambassadorship. A mixed-method approach is employed. Study 1 uses a case study to explore how employees acquire knowledge as part of their exposure to TIs. A research model that captures the underlying mechanism of how TI capabilities influence employee brand ambassadorship is then developed based on findings in Study 1. Based on Study 1 results, Study 2 conducts surveys (n = 300) to test the hypothesized framework in high-tech organizations with employees in China. Results show that both product and process innovation capabilities increase employees' psychological empowerment and autonomy, which subsequently increase their psychological wellbeing. Further, employees satisfied with their jobs are more likely to act as ambassadors for their organizational brands.

In such a situation and with the free time that has arisen, this threat of education closure can become a golden opportunity for learning and progress in virtual education. E-learning uses information technology (IT) to distribute knowledge and information for training and education. Also, cloud computing is a technology utilized in the IT domain. It can be employed in performing e-learning. Therefore, the main goal of this study is to assess the impact of cultural characteristics, economic situations, skills and knowledge on the development and success of CELS in the COVID-19 era. Design/methodology/approach: Cloud-based e-learning system (CELS) provides all e-learning requirements like software and hardware resources to promote conventional e-learning technologies. The CELS stands on several factors of diverse aspects that have been of high significance in CELS success. So, these systems must be checked to analyze their significance rate and successfully carry out their effectiveness. On the other hand, these days, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) changes our daily lifestyles. Therefore, the present investigation provides a new model investigating the development and success of CELS in the COVID-19 era. Also, an online questionnaire was used to gather the data. The content validity of the questionnaire was obtained by applying the opinions of ten experts from e-learning specialists. The collected data are analyzed using LISREL and Smart PLS software. Findings: The results from the path coefficient and the sample t-test have implied that skills and knowledge positively influence CELS in the COVID-19 era. In addition, the relationship between cultural characteristics and CELS in the COVID-19 era has been positive and significant. The relationship between the economic situations and the CELS in the COVID-19 era is positive and significant. Practical implications: The proposed model helps managers get a big picture of CELS necessities and more effectively in the COVID-19 era. This research has a unique impact on universities to develop an e-learning platform to facilitate the education process in the COVID-19 era. It provides guidelines for educational institutions to effectively implement the learning management system to facilitate students' education. Originality/value: CELS are getting increasingly essential to offer training courses more efficiently in educational institutions. Although the intersection between cloud computing and e-learning has increasingly grown in both practical and academic contexts, few studies on the impact of cultural characteristics, economic situations, skills and knowledge on the development and success of CELS in the COVID-19 era. This paper explores the ignored but critically important subject of CELS. This paper's main contribution is to present a new and integrated model containing the essential aspects of the development and success of CELS in the COVID-19 era. The proposed framework comprises cultural characteristics, economic situations, skills and knowledge aspects simultaneously, as well as sub-criteria denoting each element.

It calls attention to the relational antecedents of OID that are often overlooked in existing literature. Strong theoretical arguments are also built for context-specific outcome behaviors such as intrinsic motivation (IM) and innovative work behavior (IWB) that are relevant to knowledge work. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 357 IT industry employees in India. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to test the hypotheses and the path model. Findings: Strong support was found for relational antecedents of OID and the outcome variable IWB. The findings indicated that OID impacts IWB through the mediating mechanism of IM. Overall, the model demonstrated strong predictive power. Practical implications: The findings suggest that social and relational variables could be strong managerial levers to increase the feeling of belongingness experienced by knowledge workers in India. In turn, OID can impact IWB, which is a significant outcome for knowledge work. Originality/value: The study finds strong support for hypothesized relationships that have been unexplored or underexplored in mainstream OID literature. Relational antecedents were found to be strong predictors of OID in this sample. Also, the relationship between OID and IWB, an outcome behavior that is specifically relevant to knowledge-driven businesses, has not been explored earlier.

Critical engagement with mainstream models of agricultural science and technology (AST) development has drawn attention to the isolation of farmers as technology adopters within a compartmentalised model of AST development and dissemination. Academic, government and non-governmental actors and organisations are increasingly supporting facilitated processes in which farmers, sci-entists and engineers develop new knowledge, learning together about the nature of the problems being faced and the potential of different solution pathways. OBJECTIVE: Despite the centrality of learning to farmer-led innovation, its role has yet to be systematically explored. In response, this paper looks to understand the forms of learning and their contribution to farmer-led innovation during a three-year action-research project involving two groups of farmers from northern England and the Scottish Borders in the UK. METHODS: A researcher-facilitator convened a structured process of twenty meetings that together created opportunities for interaction, deliberation and re-framing of problems and solutions among groups of farmers, a university-based engineer, and wider stakeholders. Multiple qualitative methods were used to build under-standing of the different farming contexts and to explore the issues the farmers wanted to work on. Meeting transcripts and fieldnotes were subject to thematic analysis, informed by the analytical framework of cognitive, normative and relational learning derived from the social learning literature. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive, normative and relational learning were found to be mutually inter -dependent and equally significant, building iteratively rather than linearly: the farmers and engineer assessed new information and reappraised existing situations; they did so informed by and informing a shift in under-standing of their goals for new technology; and in so doing they relied on and developed the trust and confidence needed to acknowledge or challenge each other's perspectives. By orientating the group engagement process around the space to explore and challenge histories and contexts of AST, and by drawing on social learning principles to facilitate interaction between the different expertise of farmers and between farmers and engineers, learning emerged that interleaved technology co-design with incremental refinement of the shared norms and values embedded in the process itself. SIGNIFICANCE: A focus on learning helps deepen understanding of key mechanisms and processes that define and deliver innovation, and the findings suggest that priorities for farmer-led innovation process design should focus on modalities that open up spaces to negotiate both the purpose and products of innovation.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2021.103356,WOS,Journal

Audit and feedback interventions may be an effective approach to modifying the clinical practice of health professionals, but these may pose logistical challenges when used in hospitals. Moreover, such interventions are often labor intensive. Consequently, there is a need to develop effective and innovative interventions to overcome these challenges and to improve the delivery of feedback on prescribing. Implementation intentions, which have been shown to be effective in changing behavior, link critical situations with an appropriate response; however, these have rarely been used in the context of improving prescribing practices. Objective: Semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of providing feedback on prescribing errors via MyPrescribe, a mobile-compatible website informed by implementation intentions. Methods: Data relating to 200 prescribing errors made by 52 junior doctors were collected by 11 hospital pharmacists. These errors were populated into MyPrescribe, where prescribers were able to construct their own personalized action plans. Qualitative interviews with a subsample of 15 junior doctors were used to explore issues regarding feasibility and acceptability of MyPrescribe and their experiences of using implementation intentions to construct prescribing action plans. Framework analysis was used to identify prominent themes, with findings mapped to the behavioral components of the COM-B model (capability, opportunity, motivation, and behavior) to inform the development of future interventions. Results: MyPrescribe was perceived to be effective in providing opportunities for critical reflection on prescribing errors and to complement existing training (such as junior doctors' e-portfolio). The participants were able to provide examples of how they would use ""If-Then"" plans for patient management. Technology, as opposed to other methods of learning (eg, traditional ""paper based"" learning), was seen as a positive advancement for continued learning. Conclusions: MyPrescribe was perceived as an acceptable and feasible learning tool for changing prescribing practices, with participants suggesting that it would make an important addition to medical prescribers' training in reflective practice. MyPrescribe is a novel theory-based technological innovation that provides the platform for doctors to create personalized implementation intentions. Applying the COM-B model allows for a more detailed understanding of the perceived mechanisms behind prescribing practices and the ways in which interventions aimed at changing professional practice can be implemented.

The adoption of collaborative research agreements (CRAs) or collaboration agreements (CAs) is rising rapidly as firms attempt to access innovation from various types of organizations to enhance their traditional in-house innovation [2], [3]. To achieve the objectives of their collaborations, firms need to share knowledge and jointly develop new knowledge. As more firms adopt open collaborative innovation strategies, intellectual property (IP) management has inevitably become important because clear and fair contractual IP terms and conditions such as IP ownership allocation, licensing arrangements and compensation for IP access are required for each collaborative project [4], [5]. Moreover, the firms need to adjust their IP management strategies to fit the unique characteristics and circumstances of each particular project [5].This paper addresses one of the challenges of open innovation - the issue of the right to access and exploit innovations owned by collaborative partners inside and outside the boundary of a research collaboration. Licensing is considered as a solution to the problems of managing knowledge shared between collaborators. To design appropriate IP licensing provisions in collaboration agreements with partners in complex research and technology projects, project managers need to configure a set of critical IP licensing elements based on consideration of a strategic set of contextual factors. Drawing inspiration especially from context-related studies that have recently become more prominent in the field of innovation management [5], [6], we adopt a contextual approach to analyze the influence of a variety of factors on decisions related to IP access and licensing solutions.Our literature review covers the topics of: (1) open innovation and collaborative innovation, (2) IP in collaborative innovation, (3) IP licensing in collaboration agreements, (4) contextualization, and (5) complex product systems. We view the two concepts of open innovation and collaborative innovation as similar, with the labels being generally interchangeable, but, for simplicity and clarity, we adopt the label ""collaborative innovation."" Collaborative innovation is arguably mandatory practice for firms seeking to maintain success in complex high-tech industries [1], [7]. However, collaborative innovation may be implemented differently depending on the inherent characteristics of each industry. Moreover, since complex products require engineeringintensive tasks and involve costly RD efforts, they contain valuable technologies associated with higher potential losses if the shared technologies are leaked or imitated [8]. IP rights are therefore crucial for complex goods when technology is shared. IP licensing is used for managing knowledge transfer, facilitating innovation developments and appropriating benefits from collaborative innovation [9], [10], [11]. The essential strategic considerations for IP licensing are exclusivity, cross-licensing, sublicensing, restrictions on market, mode of commercialization, field of application, geographical area, and time, royalties, technical assistance, future developments, taxes, and restraint of trade [4].For this preliminary paper we focus on only one form of IP rights - namely, patent rights - and, for practicability, assume uniformity of the pertinent aspects of patent law across jurisdictions. In subsequent research, these constraints may be relaxed. Our main focus is company-led research collaborations in complex technological industries, such as aerospace, defense, automotive, or offshore hydrocarbon recovery, or telecommunications, in which buyer-supplier collaborations are normal and extensive. We adopted a company-centric approach to analyze IP licensing terms in bilateral agreements between a company and its collaborator. A project manager of a particular company needs to decide whether or not to grant a license to its collaborator for accessing or exploiting its IP, whether or not to acquire a license for the company to access or exploit the collaborator's IP, and also what the scope of the licenses should be. Moreover, the company and the collaborator need to have a mutual agreement covering how to manage and exploit their jointly-owned IP.Our research methodology includes an inductive approach to theorizing and developing a conceptual framework for IP access and licensing solutions in an open collaborative project. It employs a set of critical IP licensing elements and a strategic set of contextual factors based on systematic literature review and analysis of professional expertise and experience of the authors, and extensive insights, notes, and interviews of project managers, IP managers, patent attorneys, paralegals, research contract managers, procurement managers, and engineers of an anonymous large-scale international complex product company. An exploratory qualitative research project, based on a case study of the IP strategies in collaborative innovation of that company, will be discussed in a subsequent paper.The results of this current paper include how our framework was developed and how it may be implemented in practice. We consider two types of knowledge - prior knowledge (background IP) and new knowledge developed within a collaborative project (foreground IP) - and the IP access issues that appear after the ownership of IP rights have been allocated or fully transferred. We do not consider here the complicated details of IP inventorship, IP ownership rights allocation or the transfer of IP ownership rights. The IP rights could be owned solely by either the Company or by the Collaborator, or jointly owned by the two parties. Thus, there are six categories of the IP in our consideration including: (1) Company background IP; (2) Company foreground IP; (3) Collaborator background IP; (4) Collaborator foreground IP; (5) Joint background IP; and (6) Joint foreground IP. The Company needs to make different decisions for each category of IP.The main IP licensing elements in our proposed framework consist of exclusivity, geographic scope, field of application, time frame, sub-licensing scope, and level of compensation. In addition, we have identified nine contextual factors as follows:(1)Participation of Collaborator in Company's activities outside the project boundary;(2)Centrality of the technology to the Company;(3)Ease of substituting Collaborator's technology (modules) in the project with other technologies of third parties;(4)Type of Collaborator based on market intents;(5)Type of Collaborator based on business purposes;(6)Number of collaborators in the project;(7)Share of financial investment in the project;(8)Involvement of any third party in the Company's activities that require the relevant Collaborator IP; and(9)Level of IP management capability of Company.Our proposed IP access and licensing solutions inside and outside the boundary of a collaborative project are drawn from our literature review. They will be tested and refined through future empirical research with large international companies in complex technological industries. The final decision regarding IP access and licensing solutions for each project may be reached by considering the combination of different solutions in particular categories of the contextual factors of a specific collaborative project. The project manager or IP manager may reach that decision by either a managerial judgment path or a quantitative scoring path.In conclusion, our proposed framework may act as a rubric to help project managers or IP managers make decisions about designing and configuring IP access and licensing solutions in any collaborative research project by answering the two main questions: (1) ""Does the Company need to grant a license to the Collaborator for using the Company background and foreground IP or not? If yes, what is the scope of the license?"" and (2) ""Does the Company need to acquire a license from the Collaborator for using the Collaborator background and foreground IP or not? If yes, what is the scope of the license?"" A set of critical IP access and licensing elements and a strategic set of contextual factors have been identified for this purpose. Each category of the contextual factors affects the decisions about background and foreground IP access and licensing solutions inside and outside the project boundary in different ways. As a result, we have demonstrated an example of how the framework can be implemented in practice, in which the final decisions can be made either by managerial judgment or quantitative scoring. In our future research, we plan to test and elaborate the framework by using empirical evidence from large international companies in complex technological industries. Ultimately, our framework may be applied to any complex technological organization that needs to manage IP in research collaborations associated with the development of complex technological products.

Based on the diffusion of innovation (DOI) theory and the consumer decision-making model, we propose a new serial mediation model by focusing on two related yet distinct sub-dimensions of consumer innovativeness. Collecting the data from 1037 Chinese consumers through an online questionnaire platform and using a bootstrap approach to conduct a mediation analysis, the empirical results reveal that social innovativeness, which reflects the need for uniqueness, affects organic food adoption behavior through all direct and indirect pathways. Surprisingly, hedonist innovativeness, which measures the need for stimulation, affects organic food adoption behavior only through the mediation of consumer knowledge or the serial mediation of consumer knowledge and consumer attitudes. Of the different mediators, consumer knowledge is the most important, suggesting that innovative consumers primarily depend on the cognitive process to make their organic food adoption decisions. This paper contributes to sustainability literature by developing a theoretical model that reflects consumer decision-making process preferences in the specific context of organic food. These findings also assist marketers in improving marketing strategies to attract more organic food consumers. (C) 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper explores the key factors affecting employeesâ€™ innovation behaviour from three forms of organisational justice (distributional justice, procedural justice and interactional justice) and ethical leadership. The questionnaire survey method is used to survey Chinese industrial workers. A total of 323 valid questionnaires are collected, and the model is verified by SmartPLS. Findings: The study found that distributional justice and interactional justice in organisational justice had a significant positive influence on employeesâ€™ innovation behaviour. Ethical leadership had a significant positive influence on employeesâ€™ innovation behaviour and interactional justice. At the same time, ethical leadership has a significant regulatory effect on the relationship between interactional justice and employeesâ€™ innovation behaviour. The study also found that procedural justice had a significant positive influence on distributional justice and interactional justice. Research limitations/implications: This paper is limited to industrial workers in Hubei, China, and the research objects need further expansion. In terms of research methods, future research will use other laboratory research methods, combining experimental environments with real-world situations, enhancing the scientific nature of research methods and increasing the credibility of research results. Practical implications: In management practice, organisations can take various measures to improve the interaction level of employees, improve employeesâ€™ perception of organisational distribution justice by establishing a scientific distribution system, give full play to the role of ethical leadership, implement more ethical management and stimulate employees' innovation behaviour. Originality/value: This research theorises the relationship between distributional justice, interactional justice and employees' innovation behaviour and enriches the research system of employees' innovation behaviour. At the same time, it examines the regulatory effect of ethical leadership on the relationship between interactional justice and employees' innovation behaviour, which helps enrich the mechanism of ethical leadership affecting employees' innovation behaviour path. It clarifies the mechanism of the interaction among distributional justice, procedural justice and interactional justice and expands the research theory of organisational justice.

(2022),"Relational resources, tacit knowledge integration capability, and business performance",JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT,,10.1108/JKM-07-2020-0501,"Purpose - This study aims to investigate how relational resources, such as the buyer's trust in its suppliers and the level of supplier involvement, affect the level of tacit knowledge integration capabilities (TKICs) of the firm, which, in turn, is hypothesized to affect business performance. Design/methodology/approach - Based on the dynamic capabilities theory and the relational view, this paper examines how TKIC, a special case of dynamic capability, influences business performance. The research context is the Brazilian automobile industry, in which firms are currently experimenting with modular production and increasing their interactions with suppliers. Using a sample of automobile suppliers, this investigates how relational resources, such as the buyer's trust in its suppliers and the level of supplier involvement, affect the level of TKIC, which, in turn, is hypothesized to affect business performance. In addition, this paper examines the moderating effect of various communication media on the TKIC-business performance relationship. The findings confirm the importance of relational resources and TKIC on business performance. Finally, this paper explores various theoretical and managerial implications to encourage future research. Findings - The results suggested that the two relational resources (supplier involvement and buyer's trust) are important drivers of TKICs and that the level of supplier involvement in the production process mediates the relationship between buyer's trust and TKIC. Moreover, this study found that TKIC leads to superior firm performance, but the degree of media naturalness does not seem to facilitate knowledge transfer. The results confirm that supplier involvement is a pivotal process in that the buying firm's internal resources and the major suppliers' resources and capabilities are combined to achieve a competitive advantage - TKIC. Research limitations/implications - This study is subject to the typical limitations inherent in cross-sectional research designs using subjective measures. That said, this still has some important implications indicating that relational resources, such as buyer's trust and supplier involvement, are critical in developing TKIC that seize opportunities from interfirm relationships and integrate knowledge across and within firm boundaries. Moreover, while knowledge management tools can resemble face-to-face interactions to the largest extent, the research suggested that it cannot substitute face-to-face communications in transferring tacit knowledge. Practical implications - Managers deal with complex interactions and linkages due to tacit knowledge from components, systems and modules, which are critical in developing organizational capabilities. Relational resources are important strategic assets facilitating resource combination and coordination. Managers must coordinate among multiple sources of learning and partner with their suppliers at an earlier stage to develop the relational capabilities and efficiently steer the process of boundary redefinition. Finally, managers must have the ability to manage tacit knowledge within the interface with suppliers using organizational mechanisms (i.e. TKIC) to help them absorb external knowledge from their supplier network and integrate it with specific internal competences. Social implications - Recent disruptive technological developments pressure organizations to become more flexible by requiring firms to adapt quickly to constantly changing markets and to have the ability to apply different resources and capabilities to specific unique situations. All this with a huge impact on the firm's employees and society in general. Thus, interfirm relationships and the role of knowledge integration is especially crucial, given the current industry trend in favor of experimenting with innovative production methods (e.g. flexible manufacturing and modular production) that can help managers to rethink work conditions in a more meaningful and flexible for society. Originality/value - While prior research treats integrative capability mainly as a mechanism that explains superior firms' performance in an interfirm relationship, few research efforts have explicated what shapes TKICs. By examining the relationship between relational resources, TKIC and performance, this study fills this research gap and develops and tests a theoretical framework.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JKM-07-2020-0501,WOS,Journal

What is the impact of ethical leadership on followersâ€™ creativity and organizational innovation? What are the mechanisms through which ethical leadership influences creativity and organizational innovation? Design/methodology/approach: Considering a market-oriented criterion to measure organizational innovation, the data were collected from 322 small-sized information technology firms working in Pakistan. Multilevel modeling and hierarchical regression analyses were used to explore the direct and indirect effects of ethical leadership on creativity and innovation, respectively. Findings: The results show that ethical leadership is an important predictor of both individual and organizational creativity. For the individual level, the results of multilevel modeling indicate that there is a positive link between ethical leadership and employee creativity. Furthermore, ethical leadership affects employee creativity through knowledge sharing and psychological empowerment. At the organizational level, the results reveal that ethical leadership is positively associated with organizational innovation directly. Practical implications: The findings imply that ethical leadership is an important tool to promote creativity and for the advancement of innovation for developing countries as well as for newly developed industries. Originality/value: This study is first to highlight the role of ethical leadership for organizational innovation. The main contribution of the study is to explore creativity as potential mediator for ethical leadershipâ€“organizational innovation nexus; where a market-oriented criterion is taken as proxy of organizational innovation.

The analysis of dynamic utility maximization from the perspective of behavioral economics,Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management,Behavioral economics; Dynamic utility; Employment; Entrepreneurship,10.13587/j.cnki.jieem.2021.06.007,"In emerging industries especially, extensive efforts have been made to promote â€œmass entrepreneurship and innovationâ€ in China to dissolve the pressure of the â€œnew normalâ€ derived from economic growth and promote more adequate employment by higher quality means. The survival rate of Chinese start-ups, however, shown by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) report, is below 5 percent. Furthermore, the annual failure rate is twice as high as that of GEM member countries. Therefore, it is essential to study individual choice of entrepreneurship or the mechanism influencing employment. Under these circumstances, this study can guide the entrepreneurial practice of new entrepreneurs in China and provide theoretical guidance for the improvement of China' s entrepreneurship policy. Based on previous literature, this paper proposes a theoretical framework for entrepreneurial MOSR (Motivation, Opportunity, Skill, and Risk), clarifies the key drivers for individual entrepreneurial decision making, and analyzes the four factors' internal mechanisms. Moreover, this study constructs a mathematical model of whether an individual starts a business and analyzes the mechanism generating decision-making behavior between employee-to-entrepreneur and entrepreneur-to-employee. This research uses the GEM database's Adult Population Survey (APS) to conduct empirical analysis and study the mechanism influencing individual, entrepreneurial decision-making behavior. From the perspective of behavioral economics, the first part constructs the MOSR theoretical framework of the individual entrepreneurship decision-making mechanism. This study proposes an entrepreneurial MOSR model based on the MOS model. We conclude that individuals will analyze positive utility obtained from entrepreneurial income, work autonomy, and entrepreneurial opportunities when choosing their career and weigh the disutility originating from entrepreneurial risk based on the expected utility theory. Ultimately, the decision to start a business is made according to the expected total utility of entrepreneurial behavior. This paper notes that there is no exaggeration in entrepreneurial ability serving as the source of power to germinate entrepreneurial motivation of behavior agents, given that it is key to entrepreneurs seeking opportunities, creating value, and realizing entrepreneurial rent. Meanwhile, entrepreneurship skills are the endogenous mechanisms of entrepreneurial decision-making behavior. That is, entrepreneurial skills affect perceptions of entrepreneurial opportunities and the acceptance of risks, and affect entrepreneurial income and job autonomy. Therefore, this paper reveals the internal mechanism between the four factors of skills, opportunity, risk, and capacity, and puts forward the theoretical framework of the entrepreneurial decision-making mechanism. The second part analyzes the generation mechanism of entrepreneurial decision behavior based on mathematical and simulation analyses. Early in their careers, it is likely that individuals choose to become employed due to their weak ability and lack of opportunities. Nevertheless, the behavior agent will trade off entrepreneurship's positive and negative utility with increased age and ability improvement over time. If the positive utility of increased income, autonomy, and opportunities exceeds the negative utility of entrepreneurial risk, the individual may choose entrepreneurship. There is another possibility: the behavior agent may choose entrepreneurship early on because of resource and opportunity endowment. However, as time passes and age increases, the degree of marginal utility in entrepreneurship gradually leads to a decrease in entrepreneurship's positive utility. Meanwhile, individuals seek employment instead of entrepreneurship. Given the common path from employment to entrepreneurship in real life and the goal of current â€œ entrepreneurship and innovation â€™ policy in China, this study further analyzes the behavioral characteristics of such entrepreneurs by simulation. It is estimated that individuals are encouraged to choose entrepreneurial behavior earlier; this is attributed to the positive utility generated by increased entrepreneurial income, caused by the accumulation of endogenous ability. This proves the entrepreneurial ability of the internal determining mechanism. The third part empirically analyzes the generation mechanism of entrepreneurial decision-making behavior and examines the MOSR model of the entrepreneurial decision-making mechanism. Considering different countries' heterogeneity, this study adopts the panel individual fixed-effect model for empirical testing. The baseline model's regression results validate the MOSR theoretical framework. Specifically, entrepreneurs choose behavior that has the capacity for high entrepreneurial ability, judging market trends accurately, capturing market opportunities, integrating resources efficiently, and avoiding and dissolving entrepreneurial risks reasonably. The regression results of the control variables reveal that individuals from non-innovation-driven countries show more entrepreneurial motivation. One explanation is that non-innovation-driven countries are equipped with more entrepreneurial opportunities as the economy develops. They encourage entrepreneurial behaviors and policies to reduce entrepreneurial risks to promote economic development. Perceiving more entrepreneurial opportunities, individuals consequently have higher entrepreneurial willingness. This study conducts a robustness test by substituting the explained variables, alternating the regression model, and adding interaction terms; it shows that entrepreneurial ability can enhance individuals' perceived opportunities and entrepreneurial intentions, contribute to their avoiding dissolved risks, and alleviate the negative impact of risk and fear on individual entrepreneurial behavior, thus further confirming the rationality of the research proposition. The fourth part discusses the research conclusions and enlightenment. Entrepreneurship is a process whereby entrepreneurs balance opportunities and resources to achieve their goals. Therefore, the behavioral agent should strengthen the accumulation of entrepreneurial ability, cultivate team leadership, finance and marketing ability, update and accumulate knowledge in an active manner, and enhance theoretical learning and â€œlearning by doing. â€™ They should also explore the correlation between market demand and entrepreneurial resources, intensify the construction of social networks, recognize and assess entrepreneurial risks reasonably, and take active actions to mitigate them. Compared with the first developed countries, China still lags behind in financial support, education training, research transfer, and business environment. First, the government should improve the guarantee and service of entrepreneurship and enhance individuals' motivation for entrepreneurship. Second, entrepreneurship education and incentives should be strengthened, and individuals' entrepreneurial skills improved. Third, it is strongly advocated that we should provide new entrepreneurs with reasonable entrepreneurial resource support, weaken their risk perception, so as to bear greater uncertainty. Finally, we call for implementing â€œstreamlined administration and delegated powerâ€™ establishment of an administrative power listing system, simplifying the business registration process, and reducing tax and administrative burden on new firms, thereby reducing entrepreneurs' costs of time and money.

Critical engagement with mainstream models of agricultural science and technology (AST) development has drawn attention to the isolation of farmers as technology adopters within a compartmentalised model of AST development and dissemination. Academic, government and non-governmental actors and organisations are increasingly supporting facilitated processes in which farmers, scientists and engineers develop new knowledge, learning together about the nature of the problems being faced and the potential of different solution pathways. OBJECTIVE: Despite the centrality of learning to farmer-led innovation, its role has yet to be systematically explored. In response, this paper looks to understand the forms of learning and their contribution to farmer-led innovation during a three-year action-research project involving two groups of farmers from northern England and the Scottish Borders in the UK. METHODS: A researcher-facilitator convened a structured process of twenty meetings that together created opportunities for interaction, deliberation and re-framing of problems and solutions among groups of farmers, a university-based engineer, and wider stakeholders. Multiple qualitative methods were used to build understanding of the different farming contexts and to explore the issues the farmers wanted to work on. Meeting transcripts and fieldnotes were subject to thematic analysis, informed by the analytical framework of cognitive, normative and relational learning derived from the social learning literature. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive, normative and relational learning were found to be mutually interdependent and equally significant, building iteratively rather than linearly: the farmers and engineer assessed new information and reappraised existing situations; they did so informed by and informing a shift in understanding of their goals for new technology; and in so doing they relied on and developed the trust and confidence needed to acknowledge or challenge each other's perspectives. By orientating the group engagement process around the space to explore and challenge histories and contexts of AST, and by drawing on social learning principles to facilitate interaction between the different expertise of farmers and between farmers and engineers, learning emerged that interleaved technology co-design with incremental refinement of the shared norms and values embedded in the process itself. SIGNIFICANCE: A focus on learning helps deepen understanding of key mechanisms and processes that define and deliver innovation, and the findings suggest that priorities for farmer-led innovation process design should focus on modalities that open up spaces to negotiate both the purpose and products of innovation.

(2020),Outward foreign direct investment and corporate green innovation: An institutional pressure perspective,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT,,10.4102/sajbm.v51i1.1883,"Purpose: Institutional theory is a reasonable explanation for the motives of corporate social responsibility (CSR) behaviours (e.g. corporate green innovation). The existing literature defines institutional pressure as threats for legitimacy when firms operate within a country or a region; one area that has received little attention is the situation when a firm extends its operations across borders to pursue internationalisation. The study investigates the impact of outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) on green innovation at the firm level. Design/methodology/approach: The zero-inflated negative binomial regression models are estimated to analyse the data collected from 2065 manufacturing enterprises listed in China during 2007-2017 (n = 14 129). Green innovation is measured by the number of green patents, according to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) international Patent Classification (IPC) Green Inventory. Findings/results: The findings show that OFDI is positively associated with green innovation for emerging market enterprises (EMEs). Furthermore, compared with investment in emerging economies, OFDI in developed economies has a stronger positive relationship with corporate green innovation. The positive effect of OFDI on corporate green innovation will be higher for EMEs located in sub-national regions (i.e., province of the home country) with lower levels of institutional development. Practical implications: Emerging market enterprises should overcome organisational inertia and compete in a broader market to enhance their awareness and ability of green innovation. Originality/value: This article contributes to the existing literature by exploring institutional pressure faced by EMEs when they operate overseas (e.g. OFDI) can play a significant role in influencing green innovation, and enriches our understanding of EMEs' inclination towards CSR (e.g. green innovation) in the context of internationalisation.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.4102/sajbm.v51i1.1883,WOS,Journal

The purpose of this study is to explore enablers of supply chain resilience. In particular, the authors examine whether and how dynamic capabilities and knowledge management can help firms develop a resilient supply chain in times of high disruption and uncertainty. Design/methodology/approach: A single longitudinal case study design was adopted. Data was collected over 8Â years from a Pakistani textile producer and supplier through semi-structured interviews and was analyzed through NVivo to generate codes and themes that contributed to the development of the supply chain resilience model. Findings: The analysis of case study shows that our focal firm strategically acquired, transferred and integrated market knowledge by investing in digital technologies and idiosyncratic resources and consequently developed a supply chain model that was resilient in addressing logistics and delivery challenges in uncertain & critical times. Research limitations/implications: The study brings together three main research streams of organizational theory, namely supply chain, knowledge management and dynamic capabilities, and proposes a nuanced resilient supply chain model. Practical implications: By applying the research findings, managers can adjust, develop and adopt supply chain resilience to address market volatilities, thereby creating value and longevity in their supply chain operations. However, the findings are context specific and should be applied cautiously. Originality/value: The outcomes provide early hints on how companies in emerging economies can adopt and integrate novel digital technologies, and overhaul their organizational routines to facilitate knowledge management and develop dynamic capabilities, and consequently enhance the resilience of their supply chain operations.

In such a situation and with the free time that has arisen, this threat of education closure can become a golden opportunity for learning and progress in virtual education. E-learning uses information technology (IT) to distribute knowledge and information for training and education. Also, cloud computing is a technology utilized in the IT domain. It can be employed in performing e-learning. Therefore, the main goal of this study is to assess the impact of cultural characteristics, economic situations, skills and knowledge on the development and success of CELS in the COVID-19 era. Design/methodology/approach Cloud-based e-learning system (CELS) provides all e-learning requirements like software and hardware resources to promote conventional e-learning technologies. The CELS stands on several factors of diverse aspects that have been of high significance in CELS success. So, these systems must be checked to analyze their significance rate and successfully carry out their effectiveness. On the other hand, these days, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) changes our daily lifestyles. Therefore, the present investigation provides a new model investigating the development and success of CELS in the COVID-19 era. Also, an online questionnaire was used to gather the data. The content validity of the questionnaire was obtained by applying the opinions of ten experts from e-learning specialists. The collected data are analyzed using LISREL and Smart PLS software. Findings The results from the path coefficient and the sample t-test have implied that skills and knowledge positively influence CELS in the COVID-19 era. In addition, the relationship between cultural characteristics and CELS in the COVID-19 era has been positive and significant. The relationship between the economic situations and the CELS in the COVID-19 era is positive and significant. Practical implications The proposed model helps managers get a big picture of CELS necessities and more effectively in the COVID-19 era. This research has a unique impact on universities to develop an e-learning platform to facilitate the education process in the COVID-19 era. It provides guidelines for educational institutions to effectively implement the learning management system to facilitate students' education. Originality/value CELS are getting increasingly essential to offer training courses more efficiently in educational institutions. Although the intersection between cloud computing and e-learning has increasingly grown in both practical and academic contexts, few studies on the impact of cultural characteristics, economic situations, skills and knowledge on the development and success of CELS in the COVID-19 era. This paper explores the ignored but critically important subject of CELS. This paper's main contribution is to present a new and integrated model containing the essential aspects of the development and success of CELS in the COVID-19 era. The proposed framework comprises cultural characteristics, economic situations, skills and knowledge aspects simultaneously, as well as sub-criteria denoting each element.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/K-12-2020-0838,WOS,Journal

These factors have given rise to the concept of smart tourism, which can be described as a step forward from conventional tourism. To achieve a true smart tourism experience, the appropriate services must be supplied to the correct user at the right time and in the most efficient and feasible manner. Keeping the importance of technology and tourism in consideration, the proposal and penetration of innovation-driven development strategies and smart tourism have become the focus of attention in the tourism industry at this stage. Smart tourism is comprised of a large number of tourists, devices, and operational processes which generate an enormous volume of tourism data. Handling such large amounts of tourism data in an effective and accurate manner is indeed an important thing to consider. To handle this issue, this study focuses on the construction and design of a smart tourism model based on big data technologies. This study explains in detail the relationship between smart tourism and big data and explores the construction of smart tourism applications in the context of big data. By explaining the relationship between smart tourism and big data, it is pointed out that the development of smart tourism needs to rely on the construction of a smart tourism application model under the background of big data. To this end, the role of smart tourism, building smart tourism platforms, improving information sharing mechanisms, exploring the implementation path of smart tourism application models, and further promoting the development of smart tourism, is of a great interest for the enterprises, scholars, and tourists.

Design/methodology/approach The research applies an exploratory case study design considering an emerging-market multinational insurance company headquartered in Colombia. Four subsidiaries (El Salvador, Chile, Argentina and Colombia) and the Corporate Office (headquarter) served as the research sites. It also adopts an interpretive research approach providing a grounded theory framework linking international knowledge transfer and product innovation. Findings The empirical findings emphasize the central role played by the enablers (i.e. shared vision, empathy and knowledge sources) in facilitating international knowledge transfer, which, in turn, enhances product innovation. More important, however, is the detailed explanation that the paper provides regarding the enablers' microfoundational antecedents in terms of key activities that are performed at the team-level. Research limitations/implications The grounded theory framework was constructed using data collected in a single firm associated with a particular industry and regional context. The study only considered a single aspect of knowledge management (i.e. knowledge transfer). Other aspects of knowledge management systems, such as knowledge creation and knowledge application, should be used for explaining product innovation in EMNEs more comprehensively. Practical implications The study suggests a set of enabling conditions and activities that should be adopted by managers of EMNEs to improve international knowledge transfer with the aim of triggering product innovation. This includes the design of strategies for strengthening empathy among geographically dispersed teams by providing opportunities for regular live videoconferences among team members aimed at building close bonds, fostering trust and creating a sense of belonging in which participants get to know each other better and to establish a shared vision and a set of guiding principles and commitments for how the team will work. These suggestions are particularly important today when several multinational enterprises (MNEs) have been forced to rearrange their workplace by replacing face-to-face interactions with virtual work dynamics due to the COVID-19 crisis. Originality/value Previous studies have confirmed that international knowledge transfer positively influences MNEs' innovative performance. However, no studies have been conducted linking both variables in the context of EMNEs in Latin America in the service sector. The research tries to fill this gap. Besides, the paper introduces empathy as a novel enabler for international knowledge transfer and a moderator able to diminish the negative effect that cultural differences and geographical barriers have on the knowledge transfer process.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JKM-04-2021-0344,WOS,Journal

It points out, that the evaluation of low carbon technology innovation should be conducted by a smarter managing of system resource input, the process control and the system comprehensive performance as an output. Furthermore, based on the questionnaire survey and the exploratory factor analysis result on the selected indexes, this paper implements a rough set method to identify the weight of all the indexes and found that:(1) managers focus more on the affordable input of the beginning stage and the management control in the middle period of the innovation, instead on the output performance in the later stage. This indicates, that the management control during the front stages is more essential than this during the later ones; (2) the constructed evaluation framework, from the system perspective, can properly reflect the integrity, multi -level stakeholder structure and technology integration in low carbon projects, which could support the decision-maker into considering the complexity of construction and evaluation of the technology innovation performance from multi -level perspective; (3) the combined methods, adopted with exploratory factor analysis and rough set evaluation to determine the evaluation index and its weights, could well reflect the overall performance of low carbon project evaluation, the selected indicators have certain scientific and practical effectiveness, which could provide references for enterprise on LCT innovation management. as an industry with a multi -level technologies integration, the single Technological adoption or innovation cannot satisfy the economic transformation requirements of the modern construction industry development. An integration innovation management evaluation model is needed for the sustainability evaluation in the construction practice. Its development is the main scientific objective of this study, by taking into consideration the entire life cycle assessment and various other factors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

(2022),Effectiveness and satisfaction of technology-mediated learning during global crisis: understanding the role of pre-developed videos,ON THE HORIZON,,10.1108/OTH-04-2021-0057,"Purpose In today's dynamic situation, innumerable challenges are posited in the education sector because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher educational institutes (HEIs) are compelled to adopt digital technologies and technology-mediated learning in the teaching-learning processes. The purpose of this paper is to understand the factors affecting learning effectiveness, learning satisfaction and the mediating role of prerecorded videos from the learners' perspective. Design/methodology/approach A self-designed structured questionnaire based on previous similar studies is adopted as a survey instrument. It consists of 22 questions to address the five constructs of the proposed hypothesized conceptual model, developed for the study. Data of 311 students from HEIs of Maharashtra state in India were collected. Confirmatory factor analysis is carried out to test the model fitness, reliability and validity, and structural equation modeling is applied to conduct path analysis and hypotheses testing of the model. Findings Hypotheses testing reveals that perceived usefulness (PU) significantly affects the perceived learning effectiveness, which again affects the learning satisfaction of the students. In addition, perceived ease of use affects the PU as suggested in the technology acceptance model. The prerecorded videos have a moderating role to play in the computer self-efficacy and the perceived learning effectiveness of the students. This research will provide meaningful acumen to enhance the overall learning process among students in urban as well as rural India. Originality/value This study explores the technology-mediated learning during the unexpected and dynamic situations of the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of higher education in India. For sustainable use of technology-assisted learning, educators must understand the key factors that influence students' learning effectiveness and satisfaction. The research outcomes will lead toward developing the human capacities, as the prerecorded videos at the HEIs of India will provide new approaches for effectively adopting digital technologies and technology-mediated learning.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/OTH-04-2021-0057,WOS,Journal

(2017),Linking procedural memory with organizational learning through knowledge corridors,Journal of Knowledge Management,Ambidexterity vision; Focal vision; Knowledge corridors; Peripheral vision; Procedural memory,10.1108/JKM-01-2017-0018,"Purpose: This paper argues that the combination of factors that facilitate focal and peripheral vision represent two distinct types of knowledge corridors. While focal vision may help detect signals that relate to the current objectives of the firm, peripheral vision is directed to non-central issues that may provide signals that relate to emerging trends in the external environment. Ambidexterity vision refers to the tension between these two different business visions within the same organization. This paper aims to examine the significance of procedural memory to an organizationâ€™s ambidexterity vision, along with investigating the impact procedural memory has on organizational learning. Design/methodology/approach: The research conducted in this study addresses the following two questions: Does the enhancement of procedural memory result in the development of superior ambidexterity vision? Does the simultaneous development of both focal and peripheral vision enhance organizational learning? These research questions are studied by conducting an empirical investigation involving data provided by 203 banking employees. These data are analysed using a structural equation modelling approach. Findings: Analysis of the data provides support for the existence of a relationship between ambidexterity vision and organizational learning. Practical implications: The findings suggest that the re-direction of managersâ€™ perceptions to supporting and enhancing an ambidexterity vision is likely to result in an improvement in their ability to identify emerging trends, new and emerging customers and potential shifts in customer needs and tastes. Originality/value: This work suggests that the re-direction of managersâ€™ perceptions to supporting and enhancing an ambidexterity vision is likely to result in an improvement in their ability to identify emerging trends, new and emerging customers and potential shifts in customer needs and tastes.

(2017),Organisational learning in SMEs: a process improvement perspective,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT,,10.1108/IJOPM-09-2015-0580,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate how organisational learning (OL) can occur through process improvement (PI) activities, leading to sustained improvements over time in the context of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Design/methodology/approach - The authors study PI practices in six engineering-oriented SMEs via interview-based case studies. The authors draw from a range of literature and use an OL conceptual framework informed by Crossan et al.'s (1999) 4I framework as an analytical lens. Findings - The OL perspective provides new insights to conceptualise the nature of PI as a multi-level practice in SMEs. Effective PI practices within SMEs are shown to be consistent with OL concepts, enabling firms to translate individually identified improvement opportunities into organisational-level changes that result in sustained benefits. A new conceptual model is presented that explains how SMEs can learn through improvement activities. The key role of management support, both operational and strategic, is highlighted. It is necessary for management to provide sufficient PI opportunities to enable and sustain beneficial learning. Research limitations/implications - The study is based on a sample of engineering-oriented SMEs located in the UK. Further case-based, longitudinal, and survey-based research studies with firms of different types will enhance the generalisability of the findings, allowing the confirmation and extension of the new conceptual model. Practical implications - The findings provide a theoretically underpinned framework for achieving OL in engineering-oriented SMEs through PI activities. The new model highlights the key mechanisms that enable learning from improvement activities. The findings highlight the key role played by management in introducing additional learning opportunities in the form of new business that requires exploratory learning. Without this, the reduction in improvement opportunities reduces the benefits that can be realised from PI. Originality/value - OL provides a multi-level perspective to understanding how smaller firms are able to undergo systematic improvements and the support required to continually improve.",2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJOPM-09-2015-0580,WOS,Journal

Design/methodology/approach â€“ This study assesses mobile technology for claim management through the lens of the technology acceptance model (TAM) and diffusion of innovation (DOI) models as a major guideline, using exploratory research through in-depth interviews with four executive experts who are first movers in mobile claim motor insurance in Thailand. Semi-structured interviews and open-ended questions were used to conduct group interviews of insurance consumers who mostly use smartphones. The data were collected in a qualitative research approach from Thai insurance consumers (n=177), and contents were classified and analysed to gain strong insights into respondent opinions, comments, attitudes, behaviour, and experiences. Findings â€“ The results indicate that the external (social) factors influence attitude and behaviour of consumers which link to their intention to adopt M-insurance. These external factors include: preference for face-to-face service; confidence of insurers in accepting claim; and risk of claim knowledge that might cause legal issues among others. In application, the findings shall meaningfully enhance insurer firmsâ€™ improvement of adoption rate and development of future features and functions of M-insurance. Research limitations/implications â€“ This study is based on insurance consumers in each region of Thailand but focuses only on mobile claim management for motor insurance. Although the findings bring new insight and understanding of consumer preferences and behaviours, they were not tested statistically. Practical implications â€“ The study has practical implications for motor insurance claimants who are concerned over the complicated policy conditions, the perspective risk of claim knowledge and fault admission, and the on-site investigation by surveyor for another party. These are the guidance impediments to overcome M-insurance adoption improvement. Originality/value â€“ Previously, TAM and DOI approaches have been employed to study general adoption of M-banking by quantitative research which confirmed descriptive data and tested the hypothesis, but neglected crucial data. However, M-insurance is different from M-banking in term of features and functions, purpose and process of usage, and legal liability. Therefore, this study is one of a few empirical studies that attempt to identify insightful factors to consumer uptake of M-insurance which is in its early stage and lacks an underpinning TAM model. This study contributes by identifying insights of â€œpullâ€ factors to successfully develop M-insurance in Thailand.

This study examines the influence of knowledge sharing on employee service quality and customer satisfaction in the hotel industry. Another purpose of this study is to investigate the moderating effect of artificial intelligence (AI) system quality on the relationship between knowledge sharing on employee service quality and customer satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach: The research design was developed using the positivism approach and quantitative method. Data were collected via a self-administered survey from Vietnamese hotels that used AI systems in employees' work tasks. Three hundred and fifty pairs of questionnaires for frontline employees and customers were collected and used for the data analysis. Structural equation modelling was accessed to examine the framework model. Findings: This research shows that the increase of knowledge sharing behaviours significantly influenced customer perceptions of employees' service quality. Furthermore, employee service quality positively affected customer satisfaction. An indirect impact of knowledge sharing on customer satisfaction via employee service quality was found. AI system quality moderated the effect of knowledge sharing on employee service quality whereby the higher the AI system quality, the stronger the impact of knowledge sharing on employee service quality. Therefore, a moderated mediation of employee service quality was found in examining the relationship between knowledge sharing and customer satisfaction. Research limitations/implications: This study's findings direct hotel knowledge management and marketing strategies to attract international customers. The study provides hotel managers with directions to increase customer satisfaction to create a competitive advantage in international marketing strategies. Originality/value: This study's distinctive contribution lies in examining the phenomenon of employee service quality at the intersection of knowledge sharing and customer satisfaction and the use of AI systems from an emerging market context. Furthermore, the moderation role of AI quality has rarely been explored.

Since individuals interact with multiple touchpoints throughout their shopping journey, retailers must consider all channels holistically as consumers do, in order to provide them with a unified shopping experience. Thus, recently retailers are showing an increasing interest in the deployment of advanced in-store systems aimed at enhancing the shopping experience by providing customers with innovative tools able to engage them for obtaining deeper insights, saving time and feeling more independent while shopping. Such technologies can help retailers to better react to those emerging settings by: acquiring a positive image and reputation, being perceived as innovator; reducing management costs; maintaining and acquiring loyal consumers; making imitation strategies as difficult as possible for competitors; and reaching a unique and differentiated positioning. The purpose of this paper is to explore whether and how store technology positively affects the customer experience in an omnichannel retail environment and if the early adoption of in-store technology by retailers produces a sustainable competitive advantage. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve the research aim and deeply explore the phenomenon of interest, a multiple-case study involving 15 retailers, operating in different industries of the Italian market, was carried through 80 semi-structured in-depth interviews with store managers and employees. Findings: Results of the content analysis show that customers are increasingly willing to use the in-store innovations in order to obtain richer shopping experiences while retailers achieve a stronger brand loyalty as well as a better and updated brand image. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the relevant literature by proposing two conceptual frameworks. It provides a deeper understanding of possible advantages and threats resulting from early technology adoption by retailers, which is becoming essential for improving the omnichannel customer management and increasing business performance.

(2022),Governing Data and Artificial Intelligence for Health Care: Developing an International Understanding,JMIR Formative Research,Artificial intelligence; Digital health; Health policy,10.2196/31623,"Background: Although advanced analytical techniques falling under the umbrella heading of artificial intelligence (AI) may improve health care, the use of AI in health raises safety and ethical concerns. There are currently no internationally recognized governance mechanisms (policies, ethical standards, evaluation, and regulation) for developing and using AI technologies in health care. A lack of international consensus creates technical and social barriers to the use of health AI while potentially hampering market competition. Objective: The aim of this study is to review current health data and AI governance mechanisms being developed or used by Global Digital Health Partnership (GDHP) member countries that commissioned this research, identify commonalities and gaps in approaches, identify examples of best practices, and understand the rationale for policies. Methods: Data were collected through a scoping review of academic literature and a thematic analysis of policy documents published by selected GDHP member countries. The findings from this data collection and the literature were used to inform semistructured interviews with key senior policy makers from GDHP member countries exploring their countriesâ€™ experience of AI-driven technologies in health care and associated governance and inform a focus group with professionals working in international health and technology to discuss the themes and proposed policy recommendations. Policy recommendations were developed based on the aggregated research findings. Results: As this is an empirical research paper, we primarily focused on reporting the results of the interviews and the focus group. Semistructured interviews (n=10) and a focus group (n=6) revealed 4 core areas for international collaborations: leadership and oversight, a whole systems approach covering the entire AI pipeline from data collection to model deployment and use, standards and regulatory processes, and engagement with stakeholders and the public. There was a broad range of maturity in health AI activity among the participants, with varying data infrastructure, application of standards across the AI life cycle, and strategic approaches to both development and deployment. A demand for further consistency at the international level and policies was identified to support a robust innovation pipeline. In total, 13 policy recommendations were developed to support GDHP member countries in overcoming core AI governance barriers and establishing common ground for international collaboration. Conclusions: AI-driven technology research and development for health care outpaces the creation of supporting AI governance globally. International collaboration and coordination on AI governance for health care is needed to ensure coherent solutions and allow countries to support and benefit from each otherâ€™s work. International bodies and initiatives have a leading role to play in the international conversation, including the production of tools and sharing of practical approaches to the use of AI-driven technologies for health care.

The paper also explores participative decision making as a moderator in the relationship between team leader narcissism and information search effort. Design/methodology/approach: Through a survey of 667 team members and their team leaders from 96 research and development teams at 23 high-tech enterprises in China with paired samples, cross-time data were collected. Confirmatory factor analysis, hierarchical regression and path analysis were adopted to analyze the data. Findings: This paper found that leader narcissism had a positive impact on team information search effort, thereby promoting team creativity, and the effect of leader narcissism on team information search effort is more positive in the context of high participation in decision making. Practical implications: Narcissism should be a noteworthy trait in manager selection and promotion especially for the departments and teams which focus on innovation and creation. And companies should pay attention to the team work processes to ensure that team members have the opportunity to participate in decision making for promoting the team leaderâ€™s narcissistic â€œbrightâ€ side in the institutional environment and avoiding the â€œdarkâ€ side.

(2021),ORGANIZATIONAL AMBIDEXTERITY WITHIN SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT: A SCOPING REVIEW,LOGFORUM,,10.17270/J.LOG.2021.618,"Background: Organizational ambidexterity is an emerging concept and it permeates too many functional domains in the discussion of organizational performance. The importance of understanding this concept motivates researchers to explore organizational ambidexterity as internal and external capabilities in the context of supply chain. Despite its importance in building oriented capabilities to organizations, little information is known about organizational ambidexterity in supply chain context. The objective of this review is to produce a comprehensive mapping of themes related to organizational ambidexterity studies in supply chain research, particularly in improving firm performance. Method: A scoping review of the literature was conducted using Web of Science (WoS), Scopus and EconBiz databases to identify what is the nature of published scientific literature on this topic and what are the emerging themes of organizational ambidexterity in relation to supply chain studies. Result: This study found three main themes and eleven sub-themes in relation to inter-organization ambidexterity in the supply chain context. The main themes include learning process, outcome and leadership. The review indicates that most of the studies are conducted in understanding learning process. Conclusion: The management of supply chain has a positive association with organizational ambidexterity. Supply chain operations involve selection, development, and implementation of new process(es) or technology (exploitation) - the outcome of a prior search procedure (exploration), which has been described as a sequential approach to exploration and exploitation and both processes are important especially in a dynamic environment. The findings from this scoping review indicate the importance of developing and managing a supply chain that supports exploration and exploitation practices. Therefore, managers should understand that maximizing a firm's current skills is critical to profitability and market share. While continuous refinement of existing knowledge is important, it is the generation and application of new knowledge that leads to increased value (profitability) and competitive advantage. Organizational ambidexterity within supply chain management provides significant benefits to big firms in improving their long-term efficiency. This offers avenue for future research to compare the effect of organizational ambidexterity in small firm.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.17270/J.LOG.2021.618,WOS,Journal

The MTS is an emerging organizational unit comprised of tightly integrated networks of teams that may originate from one or more firms. The inquiry also considered how an MTS can engage those features and mechanisms to maximize ambidexterity as dynamic capabilities for increased innovation and long-term adaptation under complex, volatile conditions. Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual inquiry integrates the emerging research on MTSs with theory and studies relating to ambidexterity and dynamic capabilities. This inquiry focuses on the attributes and linkages that specially characterize an MTS. It analyzes these to determine the key mechanisms and interactions enabling and engaging ambidexterity at MTS unit level. Findings: MTSs can engage powerful mechanisms for ambidexterity functioning as dynamic capabilities at meso-organizational level. The attributes and linkages that distinguish an MTS from other units enable it to deal effectively and efficiently with near-term task demands by simultaneously balancing the essential tasks of exploration and exploitation, and by being able to rapidly adapt by reconfiguring taskwork and reallocating resources as required for sustainable innovation and long-term success within a dynamic environment. Practical implications: This inquiry provides valuable insights for designing MTSs that are equipped with selected teams, flexible memberships, specialized skills and permeable interfaces. Autonomy for an MTS allows the unit to span internal and external organizational boundaries to gain access to new discoveries and to exchange information and material resources for increased innovation. Ambidexterity as dynamic capabilities facilitates exploitation of current resources by efficiently reconfiguring taskwork and reallocating materials for adaptation and competitive advantage. Originality/value: This inquiry appears to represent the most integrative effort to examine the underexplored potential of MTSs for developing and engaging ambidexterity functioning as dynamic capabilities. The inquiry appears to be a first effort at articulating a concept of MTS ambidexterity distinct from organizational ambidexterity.

So, a sound system of social exchanges has always been a need in this dynamic and technological world to challenge organizational problems. Drawing on the social exchange theory, this study aims to empirically investigate the mediating relationship of a set of social exchanges, e.g. leader-member exchange (L.M.X.), knowledge sharing behavior (K.S.B.) and voice behavior (V.B.), between transformational leadership (T.L) and innovative work behavior (I.W.B). Particularly, it explores the best social exchange behavior between T.L and I.W.B that plays a highly constructive role in the innovativeness of the hospitality industry in Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach: The study targeted 403 frontline employees from hotels situated near Swat Valley, Pakistan. The study used a quantitative approach by using a convenient sampling technique. Structural equation modeling was run by using Smart partial least square 3.3.3 to test the proposed model. Findings: The research supported that T.L significantly influenced I.W.B via a L.M.X., K.S.B. and V.B. T.L did not directly and significantly influence I.W.B so, there were full mediations between T.L and I.W.B. Specifically, knowledge-sharing behavior played a highly constructive role in innovativeness. Research limitations/implications: The study targeted frontline employees from one place, Swat valley; however, data collection from different tourist places may generalize the results based on social exchanges and innovative behavior. A dyadic interaction between top-level and middle-level management may closely trace the innovative ideas among the employees. Practical implications: The study found knowledge sharing to be a highly effective mechanism that supports employee innovation more than a L.M.X. and V.B. As a result, the managers should establish a sound system of knowledge sharing, which means a knowledge economy so that employees innovativeness can be boosted and promoted. Originality/value: The present study was the first study in the hotel industry of Pakistan that reveals a highly effective mediating mechanism: K.S.B., which exists with T.L to increase workersâ€™ innovativeness highly.

Design/methodology/approach A case study approach was chosen and applied multiple methods of semi-structured interviews and a documentation review. Findings Results reveal a structured stakeholder relationship management, according to which the packaging company acts through a stakeholder engagement process to both acquire and share new knowledge to address stakeholder pressure. Co-creation models result in a winning strategy to exploit knowledge, above all in a supply chain context, where actors should act as a part of a strictly interlinked system, involving external stakeholders (also suppliers) and internal stakeholders in joint eco-innovation projects. The case study shows the potential strategic role of a packaging company in affecting relevant actors of the supply chain through the promotion of a sustainability culture. Research limitations/implications The first limitation is linked to the chosen case study approach, which does not allow for results to be generalized. Future works could arrange panel data analysis to investigate in depth the behavior of several packaging companies regarding stakeholder relationship management. Practical implications Managerial implications mainly underline that, to fully address market stakeholder pressure, managers should recognize the relevance of acquiring and sharing new knowledge from external sources, without underestimating the need to integrate it with internal stakeholders (employees) for its exploitation. Originality/value The present work is original for the food and beverage industry, with specific attention on the packaging sector, which, until today, has been widely investigated regarding food and waste loss reduction strategies, but less often from the perspective of stakeholder relationship management in addressing sustainability.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EMJB-06-2019-0077,WOS,Journal

As the organizational structures gradually improve flexibility, employees desire respect and development to a greater degree, which has given rise to a new leadership model-integrative leadership. This paper aims to investigate the impact of integrative leadership on employee's innovation performance through a multilevel analysis. Design/methodology/approach This paper proposes the two situational factors employee psychological empowerment and human resource flexibility as the mediating factors impact the relationship between integrative leadership and employee innovation performance. Valid questionnaires were collected from 619 employees from 135 leader groups of High-tech companies in China. Findings The results show that integrative leadership has positive impact on employees' innovation performance through its multilevel impacts on two mediation factors include psychological empowerment of employees and human resource flexibility. Research limitations/implications This research used cross-sectional studies due to constraints of research conditions. The measurements of all variables are done simultaneously, whereas the effects of integrative leadership on the development of corporations should be presented in a dynamic process. Therefore, in the future research, vertical research design should be adopted to deeply explore the effectiveness mechanism of integrative leadership in the context of corporate internet-based transition. Practical implications In the internet era, leaders cannot blindly pursue organizational performance. They must establish a flexible organizational structure and institutions to provide a platform for employee development, and integrative leaders need to pay attention to inspire the potential of employees and stimulate the enthusiasm of employees.

Land consolidation has widely been taken as a necessary approach for solving this problem. In the context of rural revitalization, it is of great significance to explore novel patterns of land consolidation besides traditional government-dominated pattern. The objective of this paper was to expound on the mechanism and examine the effectiveness of a new land consolidation pattern, namely the farmer-dominated pattern of ""merging small plots to large plot"", emerging in the rural area of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, in hope of making contributions to innovations on land consolidation, rural land reform, and rural revitalization. Methods of semi-structured interviews, quantitative models, and case studies were adopted. This new pattern combined a BOTTOM-UP process of land tenure adjustment, land consolidation plan, design and engineering, spontaneously carried out by farmers, with a TOP-DOWN financial support from government, which was conditional on meeting the requirements of high-standard basic farmland construction. Before ""merging small plots to large plot"", land fragmentation affected agricultural output, production cost and land use efficiency by directly or indirectly acting on input factors of land, labor, capital, technology among others in arable land use system. While ""merging small plots to large plot"" could reallocate land parcels and readjust land tenure, enhance the coordination and mutual adaption of various input factors, hence promote the alignment of productive forces and relations of production. In the case study of Nongnong Village, farmer-dominated land consolidation pattern increased the area of arable land through filling earth ditches and merging field ridge, dramatically reduced plot number through merging small plots, significantly improved arable land use efficiency and agricultural productivity through infrastructure construction such as roads and irrigation facilities and agricultural machineries application. Furthermore, this new pattern substantially increased farmers' income through adjustment of cropping structure and transfer of rural labor into non-farm employments. It was concluded that farmer-dominated land consolidation pattern was a typical model of the BOTTOM-UP land consolidation by the farmers combined with the TOP-DOWN supervision and support by government, could effectively solve the problem of arable land fragmentation and promote optimization and coordination among various input factors of arable land use system, and proved itself as an effective approach to bridge the gap between smallholders and modern agriculture characterized of industrialization and mechanization, which could contribute to rural revitalization and be extended to other regions in China as well as other developing countries. Three insights are suggested to extend this innovation pattern. First, central and provincial governments should issue policies to address the legitimacy problem concerning farmers self-organized land merger and consolidation and to provide financial supports for construction of farmland infrastructures. Second, village elites should play an important role as facilitators, coordinators, or brokers in whole process. Third, a special work team on site, comprised of village cadres, village elites, representatives of all clans and interest groups, should be assembled to deal with conflicts of interests and ensure the synergy of multiple interests and objectives.

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from the relevant stakeholders of the industry-university collaboration teams with a structured survey questionnaire. Working with 304 textile and apparel industry respondents, structural equation modeling based partial least square (PLS-SEM) is used to test the conceptual framework. PLS-SEM technique was applied to test the hypothesis using Smart-PLS 3.8 packages program. Findings: The results proposed TL has a positive impact on KMC and RI. Furthermore, the study reveals KMC positively mediated the relationship between TL and RI. This mediation is conditional on the moderating role of CI for the KMC (knowledge acquisition capabilityÂ +Â knowledge-sharing capability) path to RI. Conversely, moderation of CI is insignificant and does not influence on fostering RI. Practical implications: Leaders and managers have realized creative and innovative culture is built within the organizations by leader-follower collaboration through actual knowledge acquisition and knowledge sharing. Moreover, industry policymakers and practitioners establish the knowledge management department to enhance the innovation culture among the firms' stakeholders to encourage RI to sustain the global business market. Originality/value: The study has introduced KMC as a mediator and CI as a moderator in the proposed model between TL-RI and KMC-RI. Further, it explores the linkages between TL, KMC, CI and RI.

The majority of these focus on how research is mobilized by various actors. This paper explores the concepts of KMb both on an individual and an organizational level and discusses the role of PLN participants and PLNs as catalysts for institutional change (IC). To illustrate this, a model was developed which draws on a concept that depicts the mobilization processes at the various levels. Design/methodology/approach The model was developed by drawing on theoretical approaches to both KMb on an individual and an organizational level of schools. The strengths and limitations of the model are then assessed as part of an exploratory study. Interviews of PLN participants (n = 7) from two schools and detailed logbooks of two participants were used to reconstruct experiences of KMb in the PLNs and the process of KMb among schools. By contrasting two schools, the study traces how mechanisms of KMb occurred. Data sources were analyzed using a structured content analysis alongside a deductive-inductive code system. Findings The results of the exploratory study show that, although the model is able to map the KMb practices, some refinement is still needed. While the extension of concepts describing the work of knowledge mobilizer (KM) leads to a more theoretically differentiated perspective, the data also showed that PLN participants only partially define themselves as KMs. The connection to concepts of strategies of knowledge mobilizing on an organizational level led to an increased transparency in the theoretical model. The data showed that KMb is influenced by organizational and individual beliefs. Originality/value The paper adds to the current knowledge base through a theoretical model that addresses the underinvestigated topic of KMb regarding the link between the individual and organizational levels. With a special focus on individual and organizational levels, a connection between KMb and IC is provided. The theoretical framework and research findings from an additional explorative study can be used to further develop relevant insights into the actions of participants from PLNs that enable IC processes among their schools.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JPCC-06-2020-0048,WOS,Journal

As BCI is capable of detecting human intentions, it is a promising communication tool for paralyzed patients for communicating with external world. Many of the current BCI systems employ electroencephalogram (EEG) which is the most widely used noninvasive brain activity recording technique. EEG signal carries potential features to identify and decode human intentions and mental tasks. Recently, many researchers have started exploiting the possibilities of BCI in entertainment and cognitive skill enhancement. BCI-based games have been identified as a unique entertainment mechanism nowadays, â€œcontrolling a 2-D, 3-D or virtual computer game solely by playerâ€™s brain waves.â€ BCI games work based on a neurofeedback paradigmwhich allows an individual to self-regulate his brain signal in response to the real-time visual or auditory feedback of his brain waves/features. This neurofeedback in a gaming environment motivates and trains the players to control his brain features toward the desired stage (self-regulation). This chapter explores the state-of-the-art BCI technology in neurofeedback games, employing EEG signal. It also provides a survey of the existing EEG-based neurofeedback games and evaluates their success rates, challenging factors and influence on players. In neurofeedback games, a number of features extracted from EEG accompanied with sustained attention, selective attention, visuospatial attention, motor imagery, eye movements, etc. have been employed as distinct control signals.We will briefly review and compare various signal processing methodologies and machine-learning techniques employed in those studies to extract and decode the brain features. Besides the structure and algorithms used in neurofeedback games, the therapeutic effects of neurofeedback training and its capabilities for the enhancement of cognitive skills will also be briefly discussed in this chapter. Neurofeedback training helps to rewire brainâ€™s underlying neural circuits and to improve brain functions. Therefore, it is considered as an effective tool for boosting cognitive skills of both healthy and the disabled. Specifically, neurofeedback has been considered as an efficient treatment modality for individuals with attention-deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD). ADHD is characterized by three behavioral symptoms: inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. Along with the conventional intervention strategies such as medication, behavioral treatments, etc., neurofeedback in BCI games has also been emerging as a promising modality for treating the attention deficit. We will also discuss portable and economical EEG recording devices currently employed in BCI-based brain training modules/games. Finally, the chapter will be concluded with a brief overview of the neurofeedback developments in the context of BCI-based games until now, their potential impact on the healthy as well as on people with neurological disorders, challenges in transferring the successful protocols from laboratories into the market and hurdles in real-time BCI system design and development.

Based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), it examines a multiple mediation model with harmonious innovation passion, role breadth self-efficacy and perceived error management culture as mediators, to interpret why paradoxical leadership influences employee bootlegging. Design/methodology/approach To test the theoretical model, data were collected from 218 full-time employees from enterprises in Chinese cities using a three-wave time-lagged design. Path-analysis and a bootstrapping approach in Mplus7 were used to examine the hypotheses of the theoretical model. Findings The results show that paradoxical leadership has a positive influence on bootlegging. In the multiple mediation model, the effect paths of harmonious innovation passion and role breadth self-efficacy are significant but there is an insignificant difference in their power, while the effect path of perceived error management culture is insignificant, although it has a significant simple mediating effect and sequential mediating effect. Originality/value This study is among the first to show the influence of paradoxical leadership on bootlegging, responding to the research call to use the paradoxical factors to capture the antecedents of innovative behaviors. Second, this study enriches the outcomes of paradoxical leadership, that of bootlegging. Third, this study provides a TPB-based mechanism of how paradoxical leadership promotes bootlegging by increasing employees' harmonious innovation passion, role breadth self-efficacy and perceived error management culture.

However, little is known about SMEs' OI barriers, particularly in emerging economies. Drawing on both network and transaction cost theory, this study aims to explore the barriers to SMEs' OI adoption in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach The study adopted an exploratory sequential research design that involved both qualitative and quantitative study methodologies. A total of 644 responses (21 survey interviews and 623 usable questionnaires) across SMEs in Ghana were collected and analyzed in the study. A qualitative analysis involving quotations extracted from the respondent's statement was used to present the qualitative findings, whereas SEM-partial least square, co-variance approach, was used to analyze the formulated hypotheses. Findings Results show that significant barriers to SMEs OI adoption are collaboration barriers - difficulty in finding the right partners and problems of cooperation and coordination of operational functions; organizational barriers - lack of flexible internal procedures and structures and organizational inertia; and strategic barriers - opportunistic behavior of partners and lack of strategic and resource fit. Contrary to existing findings, financial and knowledge barriers were disclosed as driving factors, rather than barriers, to SMEs' OI adoption; these findings challenge conventional thinking about SMEs' major OI barriers. Research limitations/implications - This study focuses on only SMEs in one emerging economy, namely, Ghana, which may limit the generalization of the findings. Practical implications - The findings of this study, while limited to Ghana, offer useful insights to SMEs managers, development practitioners and policymakers respecting the overall importance of the OI model, its associated impediments, as well as the strategic measures to quell those barriers. Originality/value This study provides a pioneering empirical investigation into the main barriers to SMEs' OI adoption in a less-explored emerging market context through a mixed research approach.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJIS-11-2018-0119,WOS,Journal

In response, the purpose of this paper is to present a research model that takes information technology (IT) culture as a theoretical lens and personal innovativeness and experience in IT projects as theoretical constructs to predict behaviour and traits that explain DE success. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the literature review, the authors propose hypotheses and a research model. The authors tested the model using structural equation modelling (SEM), by surveying a sample of digital entrepreneurs operating in the Yabacon Valley, Lagos, Nigeria. Findings: The results indicate that IT culture is an essential predictor of achieving DE success. The results also suggest that an entrepreneur's innovativeness in IT and experience in IT projects have significant negative and positive moderating effects on the relationship between IT culture and achieving DE success. Research limitations/implications: This paper taps into a new setting â€“ DE context â€“ by exploring the moderation effects of an entrepreneur's innovativeness in IT and experience in IT projects on the link between their IT culture and achieving a successful DE outcome. Practical implications: This model offers managers an understanding of how IT culture and personal innovativeness and experience in IT work together to achieve DE success. Meanwhile, it sheds some light on managers to treat individuals with different levels of experience differently. Originality/value: The authors theorise IT culture, personal innovativeness and experience in IT and show their effects on DE success, thus making an essential contribution to the information systems (ISs) and entrepreneurship research and practice. Moreover, the authors provide a novel methodology to conceptualise IT culture as a second-order hierarchical reflective construct by giving evidence that partial least squares (PLS) path modelling can assess a hierarchical model with moderating effects. This study answers scholars' call to construct more accurate explanations of innovation outcomes in an increasingly digital world.

Design/methodology/approach - This study assesses mobile technology for claim management through the lens of the technology acceptance model (TAM) and diffusion of innovation (DOI) models as a major guideline, using exploratory research through in-depth interviews with four executive experts who are first movers in mobile claim motor insurance in Thailand. Semi-structured interviews and open-ended questions were used to conduct group interviews of insurance consumers who mostly use smartphones. The data were collected in a qualitative research approach from Thai insurance consumers (n = 177), and contents were classified and analysed to gain strong insights into respondent opinions, comments, attitudes, behaviour, and experiences. Findings - The results indicate that the external (social) factors influence attitude and behaviour of consumers which link to their intention to adopt M-insurance. These external factors include: preference for face-to-face service; confidence of insurers in accepting claim; and risk of claim knowledge that might cause legal issues among others. In application, the findings shall meaningfully enhance insurer firms' improvement of adoption rate and development of future features and functions of M-insurance. Research limitations/implications - This study is based on insurance consumers in each region of Thailand but focuses only on mobile claim management for motor insurance. Although the findings bring new insight and understanding of consumer preferences and behaviours, they were not tested statistically. Practical implications - The study has practical implications for motor insurance claimants who are concerned over the complicated policy conditions, the perspective risk of claim knowledge and fault admission, and the on-site investigation by surveyor for another party. These are the guidance impediments to overcome M-insurance adoption improvement. Originality/value - Previously, TAM and DOI approaches have been employed to study general adoption of M-banking by quantitative research which confirmed descriptive data and tested the hypothesis, but neglected crucial data. However, M-insurance is different from M-banking in term of features and functions, purpose and process of usage, and legal liability. Therefore, this study is one of a few empirical studies that attempt to identify insightful factors to consumer uptake of M-insurance which is in its early stage and lacks an underpinning TAM model. This study contributes by identifying insights of pull factors to successfully develop M-insurance in Thailand.",2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJBM-04-2015-0063,WOS,Journal

The purpose of this paper is to explore leader behaviours that promote innovation in a multidisciplinary musculoskeletal (MSK) service. Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore the experience and views of the multidisciplinary team (MDT) members on leadership and innovation. A total of 13 MDT members participated in the study. Findings: Inter-professional collaboration and the absence of hierarchical behaviours are associated with a positive experience. Traditionally established hierarchy and inter-professional barriers for interaction were associated with challenging experience in MDT. There was an expression of fear of and vulnerability to being â€œtaken overâ€ or â€œeaten upâ€ by other professions. Supportiveness, consulting behaviour, provision of time, vision and inspiring and risk-taking behaviours are associated with innovation. Target drove and monitoring behaviours or hierarchical expression of authority, directive or supervisory behaviours are negatively associated with innovation. Practical implications: Day to day leaderâ€™s behaviours and interactions influences the work environment for innovation. Knowledge gained through Informal interaction, understanding each otherâ€™s professional strengths and weaknesses are implicit strengths of an MDT but when a member perceives their skills as less valuable to that of another member, they hold less power and influence. Therefore, a flat hierarchy provides a more effective structure for knowledge translation and maximising MDT productivity. Originality/value: MSK services are complex adaptive systems with several pathways and interactions flowing between various specialities. For improving innovation and effective functioning of the MSK MDT, it is important to provide informal training for team leads on self-awareness of the behaviours associated with innovation.

This study examines the influence of knowledge sharing on employee service quality and customer satisfaction in the hotel industry. Another purpose of this study is to investigate the moderating effect of artificial intelligence (AI) system quality on the relationship between knowledge sharing on employee service quality and customer satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach The research design was developed using the positivism approach and quantitative method. Data were collected via a self-administered survey from Vietnamese hotels that used AI systems in employees' work tasks. Three hundred and fifty pairs of questionnaires for frontline employees and customers were collected and used for the data analysis. Structural equation modelling was accessed to examine the framework model. Findings This research shows that the increase of knowledge sharing behaviours significantly influenced customer perceptions of employees' service quality. Furthermore, employee service quality positively affected customer satisfaction. An indirect impact of knowledge sharing on customer satisfaction via employee service quality was found. AI system quality moderated the effect of knowledge sharing on employee service quality whereby the higher the AI system quality, the stronger the impact of knowledge sharing on employee service quality. Therefore, a moderated mediation of employee service quality was found in examining the relationship between knowledge sharing and customer satisfaction. Research limitations/implications This study's findings direct hotel knowledge management and marketing strategies to attract international customers. The study provides hotel managers with directions to increase customer satisfaction to create a competitive advantage in international marketing strategies.

Design/methodology/approach An exploratory multiple case study approach was adopted and three MNCs' sustainable initiatives in China were examined. The data were primarily collected through 43 semi-structured interviews with managers of focal companies and their multi-tier suppliers. Findings The authors found that in order to facilitate their supply chains to learn sustainability, MNCs tend to orchestrate in breadth by internally setting up new functional departments and externally working with third parties, and orchestrate in depth working directly with their extreme upstream suppliers adopting varied governance mechanisms on lower-tier suppliers along the project lifecycle. The resource orchestration in breadth and depth and along the project lifecycle results in changes of supply chain structure. Practical implications The proposed conceptual model provides an overall framework for companies to design and implement their multi-tier sustainable initiatives. Companies could learn from the suggested learning stages and the best practices of case companies. Originality/value The authors extend and enrich resource orchestration perspective (ROP), which is internally focused, to a supply chain level, and answer a theoretical question of how MNCs orchestrate their internal and external resources to help their supply chains to learn sustainability. The extension of ROP refutes the resource dependence theory, which adopts a passive approach of relying on external suppliers and proposes that MNCs should proactively work with internal and external stakeholders to learn sustainability.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJOPM-05-2017-0306,WOS,Journal

Understanding capacity as a property of the health system rather than only of individuals, the research explored the mechanisms triggered in context to produce outputs, including the initial sensemaking by the district manager, the subsequent sensegiving and sensemaking in the team and how these homegrown innovations interacted with existing social processes and norms within the system. Methods: We conducted a realist evaluation, adopting the case study design, over a two-year period (2013â€“2015) in the district of focus. The initial programme theory was developed from 10 senior manager interviews and a literature review. To understand the processes and mechanisms triggered in the local context and identify outputs, we conducted 15 interviews with managers in the management team and seven with non-state actors. These were supplemented by researcher notes based on time spent in the district. Thematic analysis was conducted using the Context-Mechanism-Outcome configuration alongside theoretical constructs. Results: The new district manager drew on systems thinking, tacit and experiential knowledge to design bottom-up innovations. Capacity was triggered through micro-practices of sensemaking and sensegiving which included using sticks (positional authority, enforcement of policies, over-coding), intentionally providing justifications for change and setting the scene (a new agenda, distributed leadership). These micro-practices in themselves, and by managers engaging with them, triggered a generative process of buy-in and motivation which influenced managers and partners to participate in new practices within a routine meeting. Conclusion: District managers are well placed to design local capacity development innovations and must draw on systems thinking, tacit and experiential knowledge to enable relevant â€˜bottom-upâ€™ capacity development in district health systems. By drawing on soft skills and the policy resources (hardware) of the system they can influence motivation and buy-in to improve management practices. From a systems perspective, we argue that capacity development can be conceived of as part of the daily activity of managing within routine spaces.

Studies indicate that significant improvement in global waste management systems is needed in order to avert a worsening public and environmental health emergency. The global zero waste movement exists within the spectrum of contemporary reaction and response to the growing sense of crisis and urgency around waste issues. The theory of zero waste reconceptualises, waste as a resource, which must be conserved, used efficiently and cycled back into the economic system. Zero waste seeks to assertively redirect the focus of societyâ€™s innovation, investment, education, R&D and government, business and community policies and programs away from value destroying â€˜burn-buryâ€™ disposal practices. In this sense, zero waste is strategically controversial in challenging societyâ€™s dysfunctional and wasteful status quo, as well as the vested interests, which promulgate and profit from this. The international zero waste movement demonstrates alternative approaches, which have a positive track-record of cost effectively addressing waste issues and supporting the innovation required to transition towards a circular economy and more sustainable forms of development. Emerging case studies from within industry, community and city contexts, demonstrate that zero waste approaches are framed in a continuum of learning and evolution and can be successful, scientific, measurable, a good economic investment, socially and culturally beneficial and democratically popular. However, it is also recognised that these positive indicators, are just the precursor of the level of transformational leadership and innovation, which is required in future across spheres such as: policy, programme, technology, education, research and product design, in order to realise the future zero waste city concept. Recognising the phenomenon and positive challenge of zero waste, a cluster of universities/organisations are seeking to catalyse a nexus for international zero waste academic collaboration (NIZAC). The core objective of NZIAC is to facilitate education and research to drive progress towards future zero waste cities, which are critical to realising the concept of a circular global economy and to addressing the interrelated challenges of climate change and sustainable development. A key strand in the discussion and experience informing the development of the NZIAC, is the opportunity of â€˜living labsâ€™ research theory and practice to support the co-generation of innovation in a â€˜university and host cityâ€”communityâ€™ context. This paper seeks to provide an overview of relevant research theory, the background experience of project partners, the formative consultation and collaboration process and outcomes to date in exploring the proposed â€˜nexus for international zero waste academic collaborationâ€™ (NIZAC).

Thus, research dealing with NPD, specifically in the emerging-market context, is still in its infancy. The purpose of this paper is to advance our current understanding on the determinants of NPD performance of emerging-market multinationals (EMMs) by exploring how international knowledge exploration plays a part in the international NPD performance of these firms.

Since individuals interact with multiple touchpoints throughout their shopping journey, retailers must consider all channels holistically as consumers do, in order to provide them with a unified shopping experience. Thus, recently retailers are showing an increasing interest in the deployment of advanced in-store systems aimed at enhancing the shopping experience by providing customers with innovative tools able to engage them for obtaining deeper insights, saving time and feeling more independent while shopping. Such technologies can help retailers to better react to those emerging settings by: acquiring a positive image and reputation, being perceived as innovator; reducing management costs; maintaining and acquiring loyal consumers; making imitation strategies as difficult as possible for competitors; and reaching a unique and differentiated positioning. The purpose of this paper is to explore whether and how store technology positively affects the customer experience in an omnichannel retail environment and if the early adoption of in-store technology by retailers produces a sustainable competitive advantage.

Findings The findings revealed that TL might be an important precursor to induce significant influences on FI directly or indirectly through its effect on active and passive KS processes in supply chains. In addition, the paper highlights the moderating role of CC in strengthening the impact of KS processes on FI. Research limitations/implications The paper provides a valuable understanding and novel approach for managers to improve firms' FI capability through leadership practice and KS processes. The research findings support the idea that FI capability of firms in developing and emerging nations will be significantly enhanced if leaders are interested in practicing TL style and fostering a climate of collaboration within organization. Originality/value This study contributes to bridging research gaps in the literature and advancing the insights of how TL directly and indirectly fosters FI via mediating roles of active and passive KS processes in supply chains under the climate of collaboration.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJOEM-02-2021-0258,WOS,Journal

Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 246 employees working in Tunisian knowledge-intensive firms (KIFs) and involved in 69 service R&D teams. The authors applied the partial least squares-structural equation modeling approach for data analysis using SMART PLS 3.2 software. Findings Findings provide evidence that TWEG mediates the link between TC characterized by trust, cohesion and innovativeness and KM in teams. In the line of the JD-R model, results also show that such TC provides job resources to team members that act as vitamins nurturing TWEG, which in turn boosts KM in teams. Originality/value To shed light on the micro-level foundations of KM, this paper enriches the KM literature through pioneering the examination of the effect of TC on KM in teams. It proposes an extension of the JD-R model through highlighting the TWEG's mediating role in the motivational pathway leading teams to invest in KM activities under a supportive TC.

This study reviewed the roles and challenges of agricultural engineering and technology on green development of agriculture and proposed the near future directions. The level of protection and utilization of agricultural water and soil resources in China has gradually increased, and the utilization rate of agricultural waste such as crop straws, animal manure, and agricultural membranes has increased greatly. However, problems such as water shortages and arable land degradation are serious. The utilization rate of chemical fertilizers and pesticides for food crops has been increasing year by year. However, the problems of excessive application of pesticides, and external pollution still need to be resolved. In the field of agricultural ecological protection and construction, a series of projects such as soil and water conservation, returning farmland to forests and grasses had been carried out and results were delightful. However, high-intensity and extensive production methods have caused problems such as the structural imbalance in agricultural ecosystems and functional degradation. The level of quality and safety of agricultural products in China has gradually improved. However, issues such as pesticide residues, resistance gene residues, and heavy metal pollution in a few regions are still not optimistic. To resolve these problems, this paper proposed possible technological innovation in agricultural engineering serving green agrarian development: 1) In the field of agricultural resource monitoring, the further research should focus on core technologies of monitoring, evaluation, and early warning analysis of cultivated land quality, biological resources, production environment, non-point source pollution, and land carrying capacity so as to build decision-making systems that could integrate real-time monitoring, remote diagnosis, early warning, emergency prevention and control, and command and dispatch. 2) In the field of utilization of water and soil resources, the future study should enhance the use efficiency of agricultural water resources by developing water-saving equipments, establish efficient water-saving modes, improve the efficiency of land resource utilization by focusing on construction of farmland ecosystems and rehabilitation of farmland pollution. 3) In regard to agricultural inputs, the focus should be on the transformation of fertilization application methods, the application of new fertilizer technologies, as well as high-yield and efficient fertilization technologies for crops. In regard to pesticide reduction and control, the key was to develop in-situ intelligent nutrient detection, enhance fertilizer reduction and efficiency based on fertilizer application limit standards, accelerate the revision of organic fertilizer industry standards, promote the use of new fertilizer products, and develop fertilizer reductions for different crops in different regions. 4) In terms of agricultural mechanization, the main direction of the future research was to focus on fields such as large-scale field planting, facility agriculture, cash crops and aquaculture of livestock and poultry, and resource-saving agricultural machinery, straw return to the field, intelligent agricultural equipment sensors, agricultural machinery navigation, and precision operations. 5) In terms of agrarian waste resource utilization, the next work should explore the theoretical system of agricultural waste resources recycling, biological transformation and pollutant removal mechanisms, and develop equipments related to returning crop straws to the field, maturation of anaerobic fermentation, pyrolysis carbonization, and collection and storage of agricultural waste resources and so on. This paper put forward to policy suggestions from 4 aspects: strengthening the concept of green agricultural development, establishing a technological innovation and extension system, improving the construction of a standard order and strengthening policy support. It is hoped to provide meaningful guidance for further improving China's agricultural engineering technology innovation level and promoting green agrarian development.

In the last decade, a new entrant in the education sector has been e-learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced educational institutes to look at e-learning as a path to continue the learning process. The present paper aims to propose a model highlighting the enablers that encourage the smooth and effective delivery of e-learning process and highlight the barriers that cause hurdles in the effective delivery of e-learning. The researchers have followed the Total Interpretive Structural Modelling and Fuzzy Matricedâ€™ Impacts Croiseâ€™s Multiplication AppliquÃ©e a UN Classement (MICMAC) analysis approach of extant literature review, expert opinion and multiple iterations to arrive at the proposed model. The findings of the present research study show the linkages between the identified enablers: institutional culture, institutional capability and support, flexibility in the teaching-learning process, e-readiness, motivation, knowledge management practices, and technology. Knowledge management practices that include practices of capturing knowledge and sharing knowledge have emerged as the most significant enabler of e-learning. The model on barriers to e-learning shows the relationship between lack of required skills, lack of access to technology, quality concerns, time as a barrier, learner engagement as barriers to effective e-learning.

In total, 33 rural coastal villages were studied for different uses of ecological indicators in seasonal predictions based on oceanographic parameters, hydro-geological, astrophysical, meteorological and biological conditions. We focused on oral dialects from traditional fishing practitioners, local community leaders and fishers as efficient respondents to carry out the study. In addition, we also attempted to develop a template of seasonal ecological calendar based on ecological indicators of Tamil Nadu coastline. This conceptualisation can also be absorbed on a synoptic scale as an integration framework of ITEK and scientific innovations. On the other perspective, it is so factual that adaptation of ITEKs in the current decades is in verge of extinction due to several factors such as modernization, technological advancements and waning intergenerational knowledge transmissions. In the face of losing ITEKs, it is crucial to integrate ITEKs in the scientific seasonal forecasting of environmental changes and climatic events to facilitate better decision making policies on adaptation and mitigation strategies. It is highly essential to build the concept of conservation and documentation of ITEK to solve the climate crisis and effective decision making. In the recent years, the approach of integrating biophysical and social sciences on understanding earth science is an emerging concept to enhance climate knowledge. Application and integration of ITEKs with scientific ecological modelling systems possess tremendous potential to develop accurate scientific forecasts and reliable future predictions.

(2020),Are all innovation modes beneficial to firms' innovation performance? New findings from an emerging market,CHINESE MANAGEMENT STUDIES,,10.1108/CMS-06-2019-0214,"Purpose This paper aims to examine the influence of individual and combined effects of the mode focused on scientific and technological-based innovation (STI) and the mode based on learning by doing, by using and by interacting (DUI) on firms' innovation performance and whether information technology (IT) moderates the relation between different innovation modes and firms' innovation performance. Design/methodology/approach A conceptual model linking innovation modes, IT (including IT infrastructure and the frequency of IT usage) and firms' innovation performance was developed, and the proposed hypotheses were tested empirically using World Bank's micro survey data collected from manufacturing firms in an emerging market (China). Findings The results show that individually both STI mode of innovation and DUI mode of innovation have a significant positive effect on firms' innovative performance, whereas the combined STI and DUI mode of innovation has a negative impact. IT infrastructure moderates the relation between STI (or STI and DUI) mode of innovation and firms' innovation performance, while the frequency of IT usage has no moderating effects on the relationship between any kind of innovation modes and firms' innovation performance. Research limitations/implications Although some results are quite different from what is expected, these are insightful for both academics and policymakers. The use of cross-sectional data has its limitations. Therefore, future studies based on longitudinal data should be conducted. This study points toward the need to conduct the meta-analysis to better explain the existing inconsistencies in the findings of relevant quantitative studies. Practical implications This study provides firm managers with practical implications. The conclusions of this study imply that the impact of the combined STI and DUI mode of innovation is likely to be contextual, so firms should make contingent decisions on whether to engage in STI mode of innovation and DUI mode of innovation simultaneously according to their own organizational conditions. Moreover, face-to-face contacts are particularly important when a firm engages in DUI mode of innovation. In addition, the focus of IT strategy of firms engaged in STI mode of innovation should be on perfecting their IT infrastructure rather than increasing the frequency of IT usage. Originality/value This paper provides new evidence for the relation between business innovation modes and firms' innovation performance, and it is one of the few empirical studies that focus on emerging markets. More importantly, this paper proposes a persuasive explanation framework for understanding the heterogeneous impacts of the combined STI and DUI mode of innovation on firms' innovation performance. This is the first study that examines the moderating effect of IT on the relationship between business innovation modes and a firm's innovation performance.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/CMS-06-2019-0214,WOS,Journal

The purpose of this study was to generate a broad understanding of the variation in conceptualizations of research-practice-policy partnerships, rather than dominant conceptualizations. Design/methodology/approach Arskey and O'Malley's (2005) five stage scoping review process was utilized including: (1) a consultative process with partners to identify research questions, (2) identify relevant studies, (3) study selection based on double-blind peer review, (4) charting the data and (5) collating, summarizing and reporting the results in a research model identifying key dimensions and components of research-practice partnerships (RPPs). Findings Coburn et al. (2013) definition of RPPs arose as an anchoring definition within the emerging field. This article proposes a model for understanding the organization and work of RPPs arising from the review. At the core lies shared goals, coproduction and multistakeholder collaboration organized around three dimensions: (1) Systems and structures: funding, governance, strategic roles, policy environment, system alignment; (2) Collaborative processes: improvement planning and data use, communication, trusting relationships, brokering activities, capacity building; (3) Continuous Learning Cycles: social innovation, implementation, evaluation and adaptation. Research limitations/implications By using a common framework, data across RPPs and from different studies can be compared. Research foci might test links between elements such as capacity building and impacts, or test links between systems and structures and how those elements influence collaborative processes and the impact of the RPPs. Research could test the generalizability of the framework across contexts. Through the application and use of the research model, various elements might be refuted, confirmed or refined. More work is needed to use this framework to study RPPs, and to develop accompanying data collection methods and instruments for each dimension and element. Practical implications The practical applications of the framework are to be used by RPPs as a learning framework for strategic planning, iterative learning cycles and evaluation. Many of the elements of the framework could be used to check-in with partners on how things are going - such as exploring how communication is working and whether these structures move beyond merely updates and reporting toward joint problem-solving. The framework could also be used prior to setting up an RPP as an organizing approach to making decisions about how that RPP might best operate. Originality/value Despite increased attention on multistakeholder networks in education, the conceptual understanding is still limited. This article analyzed theoretical and empirical work to build a systematic model to study RPPs in education. This research model can be used to: identify RPP configurations, analyze the impact of RPPs, and to compare similarities and differences across configurations.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JPCC-11-2019-0031,WOS,Journal

(2020),The effects of organizationally territorial climate on exploitative innovation from the interactionist perspective on organizational innovation: A moderated mediation model,Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management,Control-oriented HRM system; Exploitative innovation; Inter-functional coordination; Territorial climate,10.13587/j.cnki.jieem.2020.02.005,"Exploitative innovation is a means for enterprises to create commercial value from existing knowledge, technology, and markets, and can shape the competitive advantage of enterprises. Taking into account the importance and universality of the applications of such innovation, scholars have explored the factors affecting the use of exploitative innovation from multiple perspectives, two being organizational atmosphere and organizational structure. However, most of the existing literature on exploitative innovation evaluates the independent impact of each perspective on the utilization of such innovation, ignoring the joint effect of the two together. This study believes that a comprehensive examination of the combined effect of organizational atmosphere and organizational structure on the utilization of exploitative innovation would bear great theoretical and practical significance for the subject. First, organizational atmosphere is a ""soft"" element that can constrain members and play a role in social environments, while organizational structure is a ""hard"" element that plays a role in more contextual environments. Therefore, within organizations, organizational atmosphere and organizational structure are two important factors that can each independently constrain the behavior of members, but can also act in combination. Second, the interactive perspective of organizational innovation believes that innovation is a complex product of the interaction between the particular body (individual, team, or division) of an organization and the specific situation. Among them, situations can be divided into two categories, according to certain characteristics: situations that can exert social influence, such as group norms spontaneously formed in the social interaction of organizational members, and more contextual situations that act as background environments.Organizations must arrange various elements, such that they work in tandem to drive innovation.Organizational atmosphere, as a ""soft"" element that constrains members, can construct a social environment that affects innovation, while organizational structure, as a ""hard"" element, constructs a more contextual environment that creates a similar effect. According to the interactive perspective of organizational innovation, organizational atmosphere and organizational structure should be perceived as working cooperatively to drive innovation. Working with the interactive perspective of organizational innovation and territorial theory, this paper explores the influence of the territorial organizational atmosphere on the utilization of exploitative innovation in enterprises and identifies the intermediary mechanisms and boundary conditions for its proper function, thereby defining not only the atmosphere, but also an organizational model (control-oriented HRM system), and an integrated model of each departmental entity (inter-functional coordination). In this paper, the methods of hierarchical regression analysis and process analysis are applied, and 2113 members of 146 companies are used to build a representative sample of multi-source data. The study found that the territorial organizational atmosphere, as a ""soft"" element that constrains the behavior of organizational members, will reduce inter-functional coordination and is not conducive to the realization of exploitative innovation. Further, the control-oriented HRM system, as a structural element of the organization, can be considered a â€œhardâ€ factor in terms of behavioral constraint. It can indirectly buffer the negative effects of the territorial climate, by exploiting technological innovation via adjusting the relationship between inter-functional coordination and utilization of such innovation. This paper contributes to a body of research on organizational innovation, territoriality, and HRM systems. First, in comparison to previous studies, the impact of organizational atmosphere and organizational structure on organizational innovation is evaluated from a different perspective. This paper integrates and examines the joint role of organizational atmosphere and organizational structure on exploitative innovation, based on the interactive perspective of organizational innovation. In addition, it explores the theory of territoriality as an emerging perspective. From this perspective, the antecedent variables affecting exploitative innovation contribute to the literature on organizational innovation. Second, this paper proposes that a territorial climate exists within the organization, such that its members will engage in territorial behavior that influences the organizationâ€™s exploitative innovation, and further examines the intermediary mechanisms and boundary conditions for its proper function, thus enriching the theory of territoriality. Third, this paper explores the ""soft"" elements of organizational atmosphere, and how they interact with the â€œhardâ€ elements of the HRM system to influence organizational innovation. The results show that the control-oriented HRM system plays an important role in buffering the negative effects of territorial climate on exploitative innovation. Therefore, the conclusions of this paper have deepened researchersâ€™ understanding of the HRM system.

Given the substantial contribution of SMEs to national economies, the present paper explores what factors tend to be associated with the success of EU-supported innovation by SMEs in Poland during its early post-accession period. Design/methodology/approach â€“ A conceptual model relating the type of innovation, investment purpose, funding type and financial readiness, location and collaboration possibilities, company size and sector of operation to changes in the capital base, employment, unit price and revenue is proposed. This model is operationalised and estimated as a structural equations model and estimated using a sample of 110 SMEs surveyed in 2008 in the Greater Poland (Wielkopolska) region in Poland. Findings â€“ Two approaches to the successful use of innovation support have been observed among the studied companies. The first approach implements market innovations to establish a presence in foreign markets and to move the product or service up the value chain. The second approach uses the funding to de-risk workforce expansion and increase production capacity. Originality/value â€“ The paper provides the first systematic disaggregate level analysis of an early post-accession context where impacts of EU support for SME innovation are decomposed into effects of specific investment conditions and innovation type on changes in capital base, employment, unit price and ultimately revenue. The insights provided here are valuable for managers developing business and innovation strategies on the one hand, but also for policymakers responsible for creating an entrepreneurship friendly environment in emerging economies.

It also deepens the understanding of appropriate mechanisms and conditions to improve specific aspects of innovation by examining the mediating role of knowledge management capability (KMC) and moderating mechanism of collaborative culture. Design/methodology/approach This study utilized structural equation modeling (SEM) and cross-sectional design to test hypotheses in the proposed research model using survey data collected from 365 participants in 86 manufacturing and service firms. Findings The findings indicate that TL induces greater effect on radical innovation compared to its effect on incremental innovation. The mediating role of KMC between TL and aspects of innovation capability is also supported. Especially, the influences of KMC on specific aspects of innovation capability are different and depend on the degree of collaborative culture in an organization. Research limitations/implications Future research should examine the mediating mechanisms of knowledge acquisition, knowledge sharing and knowledge application to provide deeper insight into specific roles of knowledge management's constituents in linking TL and innovation capability. Practical implications The paper significantly contributes to increasing the understanding of the link between TL and specific aspects of innovation capability by highlighting the important role of KMC and positive effects of collaborative climate in an organization. Originality/value The paper is unique in the attempts to provide a prospective solution for firms to pursue and improve innovation based on the meaningful insights into the mediating role of KMC and moderating effect of collaborative culture in the relationship between TL and specific dimensions of innovation capability.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/K-12-2020-0905,WOS,Journal

In an attempt to address this knowledge gap, this study draws on the dynamic capabilities view, and on recent literature on knowledge strategy planning (KSP), and examines the alignment between KSP and ISS to enable dynamic capabilities innovation capabilities (DCIC) to gain FP. Design/methodology/approach The survey examined empirical data from 234 Brazilian companies using the partial least squares path modeling to test the hypotheses proposed herein. Findings The empirical results confirmed that both KSP and ISS have a positive impact on DCIC. Furthermore, the results indicated that FP was positively impacted through DCIC. The results indicated that the alignment between KSP and ISS positively impacts DCIC and ultimately FP. Research limitations/implications The data was collected from 234 Brazilian companies in a country classified as a developing economy. Future studies could investigate the impact of KSP and ISS on FP in developed economies. The practical implication of the study required managers to be knowledgeable about the value of alignment between KSP and IT capabilities involving more practitioners in the strategy-as-practice to create innovation capabilities and enhance FP. Originality/value This is one of the earliest studies that has investigated the relationships between KSP and ISS and their impact on FP within a developed economy context.

(2021),Injecting courage into strategy: the perspective of competitive advantage,EUROPEAN BUSINESS REVIEW,,10.1108/EBR-12-2019-0306,"Purpose This study aims to examine the mediating effect of four antecedents of competitive advantage on the linkage of risky strategy to firm performance, measured by revenue dynamics. It considers the roots of competitive advantage to highlight different patterns and foundations of achieving superior performance. It investigates whether pursuing a risky strategy fosters revenue dynamics growth and whether different mediators are included in that relationship. Design/methodology/approach Path analysis (structural equation modeling) method is used to analyze data from 122 companies of various sizes and industries. All respondents were responsible for executing strategic management processes. The paper used the subjective perspective, which is based on the individual opinion of senior company managers and owners. Findings The authors find a positive relationship between risky strategy and firm performance, but no evidence of a mediating role of competitive advantage and dynamic growth in this relationship. Competitive advantage should be perceived as a set of integrated factors that can be analyzed from an aggregated perspective. Integrating all antecedents requires a holistic and systematic approach and the development of a particular mindset. Aggregated competitive advantage is related to setting dynamic growth as a priority. However, no relationship between risky strategy and achieving competitive advantage, or between implementing a risky strategy and setting dynamic growth as a priority, is observed, which was assumed to explain the revenue dynamics growth. Research limitations/implications Secondary data should be analyzed to explore how risky strategies are manifested, and which managerial decisions are reflected in high-level risk. A multidimensional scale could be developed to check how risk shapes the constructs' interdependence. Therefore, the dynamic capabilities approach could be further expanded. Practical implications This research offers insights into the short-term relationship between risky strategy and revenue dynamics, although competitive advantage does not mediate that relationship. Special attention should be paid to the selected antecedents of competitive advantage, as they influence dynamic growth. Originality/value This work provides insights into different antecedents of competitive advantage, which is not necessarily based on making risky decisions, and into factors that facilitate firm performance measured by revenue dynamics.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EBR-12-2019-0306,WOS,Journal

The mediating role of transformational leadership,LEADERSHIP & ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL,,10.1108/LODJ-12-2014-0242,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the role leader attention plays in the nurture of transformational leadership (TL) behavior, as well as the mechanism by which TL affects innovation ambidexterity, this research empirically studied the relationship between leader attention scope (LAS) and innovation ambidexterity (exploratory innovation and exploitative innovation) through the mediating role of TL. Further, the moderating effect of environmental dynamism (ED) on the relationship between TL and innovation ambidexterity was examined. Design/methodology/approach - Empirical study was adopted by distributing questionnaires to high echelon leaders in mainland China to assess related variables. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the relationships of the variables based on the 188 returned questionnaires. Findings - The results show that LAS had a positive effect on innovation ambidexterity, and the relationship was partially mediated by TL. ED negatively moderated the relationship between TL and innovation ambidexterity. Practical implications - The results suggest that upper echelon leaders receive more unfamiliar, outward-oriented, and source-diverse information to broaden their attention scope. The broad outlook they get obliges them to engage in TL behavior which is beneficial for innovation ambidexterity. Originality/value - Based on upper echelons theory, this research reveals the realization mechanism of innovation ambidexterity from the perspectives of leader attention and leadership behavior. This paper avoids the previous research limitation of prevalently employing demographic measurements to substitute for leaders' psychological processes. The study of LAS also explains the formation mechanism of TL. ED is considered to examine the effectiveness of TL.",2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/LODJ-12-2014-0242,WOS,Journal

(2020),Machine Learning and Grounded Theory: New Opportunities for Mixed-Design Research,AMCIS 2020 PROCEEDINGS,,,"Grounded theory (GT) can be simply understood as the discovery of emerging patterns in data'. Classic GT (or Glaserian GT(2)) is more specifically known for providing a general methodology for the development of theory inductively using any data (Holton & Walsh, 2016). Since its introduction (Glaser & Strauss, 1967), GT had a significant impact on theory building through qualitative inquiry in various disciplines, for example in Information systems, seminal work of IT and organizational change (Orlikowski, 1993) and cross-cultural collaboration in virtual teams (Levina & Vaast, 2008). Though GT's approach accommodates any type of data with its dictum, All is Data. But GT studies using quantitative data are limited; even in mixed design studies, its role is limited to basic descriptive statistics, correlation, and cluster analysis (Walsh et al., 2015). In a digitized world, organizations record/collect/log their activities in the form of digital traces date(3). Since such data is not collected with any particular research objective, this data is simply amassed in the organization's information system (Howison, Wiggins, & Crowston, 2011). From a social science and organization research perspective, such a new source of data can provide many research opportunities (Berente, Seidel, & Safadi, 2019). Particularly, with the assistance of machine learning (ML) algorithms, which are derived at the intersection of statistics and computer science, we can discover robust patterns in traces data. Such patterns could provide powerful insight related to social life (Puranam, Shrestha, He, & von Krogh, 2018). However, since ML-based techniques are primarily geared towards the task of prediction, getting Y hat, not beta (Mullainathan & Spiess, 2017), such patterns or empirically regularities are not considered as theory among scholarly outlets (Agarwal & Dhar, 2014; Walsh et al., 2015). Also, when the number of variables are large (more likely in traces data), the likelihood of having highly correlated variables is significant, which in turn can lead to the substitution of variables in iterations of ML models during training, without affecting the accuracy of the model. The very idea of the ability of ML techniques to identify hidden generative structures within data raises the question about the stability of these patterns. Thus, Mullainathan and Spiess (2017, p-98) stress that future research in machine learning would be to make sense of some structures that ML models have found without making strong assumptions about the underlying true world. In recent years, there is significant attention being paid towards incorporating ML methods in management and organization research. For instance, Puranam et al. (2018) present well-argued guidelines for algorithmic induction through ML methods that could be used as a tool in interpretative and comparative case analysis. Choudhury et al (2018) present steps to generate robust patterns from data through ML which later can be tested with traditional econometric methods. While these studies bring ML techniques into mainstream management and organization research, its application is still portrayed as an exploratory tool. However, there is an opportunity to combine ML methods to grounded theory method (GTM), which would strengthen the researcher's ability to develop stronger hybrid theory (Muller, Guha, Baumer, Mimno, & Shami, 2016). As we note earlier GTM is open to all types of data and analysis techniques. GTM emphasizes that quantitative/statistical analysis methods are merely techniques for arriving a type of fact, it is still up to the researcher to discover and analyze the theoretical relevance of these facts (Glaser and Strauss, 1967, p-201). However, to the best of our knowledge, empirical studies have not yet systematically attempted to blend ML with GT methods in their research design which could be helpful in better understanding of the research phenomenon. In our ongoing research project, we present our early experience of blending machine learning methods with qualitative data based on the framework of mixed-design grounded theory method (Walsh, 2015). In this ongoing research, we discuss emerging ML-driven mixed-design approach. We started with a large volume of traces data related to the employees of a large organization over the years; this slice of data was analyzed using supervised machine learning techniques(4) with a broad area of inquiry of fair promotions (presence or absence of Gender discrimination in promotions or Glass Ceiling). The pattern that emerged through ML-based techniques were further analyzed with Glaser's (Glaser, 2008) elaboration analysis of theoretical ordering. Such analysis helped in finding the core concepts (patterns) that could largely explain the variation in the data. These emerging patterns were further used for the theoretical sampling of qualitative inquiry. It provided another slice of data that helped in conceptualization through constant comparative analysis. We emphasize here that mixing ML techniques and qualitative methods with principles of GT, one could avoid the suspicion of correlated covariates, spurious factors and anticipated consequences (Walsh, 2015). ML method's Achilles heel of not knowing conclusively the covariates responsible for variation in data (Mullainathan and Spiess, 2017) could be mitigated with the mixed-design GT framework. In this paper, we share our initial results and emphasize that such a mixed methodological framework yielded relationships that otherwise would have been difficult to preconceive or time-consuming to observe.",2020,,WOS,Conference Paper

To respond, the current study has suggested a moderated mediated mechanism to explain the link between HRM, through its new High Performance Work Systems (HPWS) and organisational innovation, as employee engagement mediates the relationship between HPWS and employee creativity. Then later one has subsequent influence on organisational innovation; moreover, the model also considers the moderating role of employee perspective-taking between HPWS and employee engagement. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative-deductive causal method, along with a cross-sectional approach was adopted, and SMEs in Jordan were the focus for the present study, through targeting employees in Research and Development centres. Data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire answered by 272 employees and Structural Equation Modelling using SMART-PLS was used for the statistical analysis. Findings The results confirmed that employee engagement fully mediated the relationship between HPWS and employee creativity and accounted for 69.5% of the variance; additionally, perspective-taking as a moderator of the relationship between HPWS and employee engagement was confirmed. Moreover, employee creativity significantly predicted organisational innovation to moderate levels. Originality/value The study suggested a unique mechanism for the link between HPWS and organisational innovation, contributing to the suggested gap that could have numerous variables acting as mediators or moderators which require further investigation to explore other possible mechanisms.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/ER-09-2019-0369,WOS,Journal

Case evidence demonstrates an inherent tension between innovation and commodification resulting from multiple demands through various developmental stages. The life cycle model has important implications for value-creation in professional service operations management. First, it broadens the theoretical investigation of professional services to consider all processes and people along the professional continuum - from most innovative to commodified. Coordinated effort along the professional continuum is the key to delivering both effectiveness and efficiency. Second, proactively managing the transitions along the evolutionary path is both possible and desirable. Standardization and specialization improve talent allocation and boost future innovation.

Background With the advent of the era of the knowledge economy, knowledge has been replacing traditional resources such as capital, labor, and land to become the critical resources of enterprises. The competitiveness of an organization depends much on the effectiveness of its knowledge management; the success of its knowledge management largely relies upon employeesâ€™ motivation and willingness to engage in knowledge sharing. Methodology This study is a longitudinal analysis of data collected from 281 newcomers in Chinese enterprises at two-time points with a one-month interval. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was conducted to test hypotheses by calculating standardized path coefficients and their significance levels. Contribution The study examined models linking organizational socialization and knowledge sharing that included organizational links and sacrifice as mediators and trust as a moderator. Findings Results show that the influences of organizational socialization on knowledge sharing change regularly over time. In the role management stage, coworker support and prospects for the future impact the practices of knowledge sharing through links and sacrifice. Moreover, the findings show that trust moderates the effect of links and sacrifice on employeesâ€™ knowledge sharing. Recommendations This study can help enterprises develop targeted human resource manage-for Practitioners ment strategies, improve the degree of job embeddedness within the organization, and thus encourage more knowledge sharing among employees. Recommendations First, researchers could pay attention to more underlying mechanisms and for Researchers boundary conditions in the relationship between organizational socialization and knowledge sharing. Second, focusing on specific cultural context and dimension of concepts may provide a new insight for the future study and help add greater theoretical precision to knowledge sharing. Impact on Society First, this study suggests that coworker support and prospects for the future improve knowledge sharing within the organization. Second, understanding how job embeddedness (organizational links and organizational sacrifice) acts as a mediator enhancing knowledge sharing, managers should consider raising their attachment relationship to organizations from two aspects: links and sacrifice. Third, knowledge sharing takes place in a team-oriented context, where the success of the team requires high-quality relationships among individual team members within the team as a whole. Future Research Researchers in the future should employ experimental research design or utilize longitudinal data to ensure that the findings reveal causation. In addition, future research can investigate how the initial level and later changes of organizational socialization are associated with knowledge sharing beyond the observational scope of traditional cross-sectional and lagged research designs.

The purpose of this paper is to further elucidate how a TMS promotes ambidexterity and examine both its mechanism process and the conditions influencing the process. Design/methodology/approach This study is based on a questionnaire survey of 94 high-tech enterprises in China. Findings The findings show that the positive relationship between TMS usage and innovation ambidexterity is mediated by TMT shared leadership, which refers to collective decision-making behaviors and can integrate the heterogeneous knowledge of the TMS into coherent strategic forms. The authors also found that having a TMS was more positively related to innovation ambidexterity via shared leadership when top managers have high team learning goal orientation or high team performance approach goal orientation. Originality/value This research contributes to the literature on the antecedents of innovation ambidexterity by showing the effects of TMS and TMT shared leadership, responding to the call to explore how TMT cognitive structures interact with behavioral processes to shape ambidexterity.

This study also investigated the mediating role of the digital platforms in these relations. The study was based on the quantitative research design and data were collected from the 397 CEOs and managing directors of Small and Medium Enterprises in Pakistan. Correlation and structural equation modeling approaches were applied for the analysis and testing of the hypotheses. Results revealed that the digital orientation, IoT and digital platform are major antecedents of the sustainable digital innovation. Results also show that the digital platforms mediate between both digital orientation-sustainable digital innovation link and IoT-sustainable digital innovation link. The rapid pace of change in the technology has forced the business organizations to think out of box and align their operational mechanism accordingly. The need for the sustainable digital innovation is a major need of the current decade for meeting the increasing demands of the society in a sustainable way. Organizations, especially SMEs, should be able to deal with these challenges and rapid technological transformations through cost effective frugal business models. The frugal innovation is an important element of sustainable digital innovation enables SMEs to reduce resources usage and waste and to enhance sustainable economic activities. In this way, they can develop and gain advantages in this highly competitive digital environment.

The moderating role of entrepreneurial leadership,GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE MEMORY AND COMMUNICATION,,10.1108/GKMC-02-2022-0041,"Purpose - Innovation has become a necessity for the information technology (IT) sector, especially during COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this study aims to investigate how knowledge sharing affects employees' innovative work behavior (IWB). Specifically, the study examined occupational self-efficacy (as mediating mechanism) and entrepreneurial leadership (as boundary condition) to encourage IWB. Design/methodology/approach - The study used social media platforms to collect data from 270 employees working in the IT sector through google forms on convenience basis between March and August 2021. The study applied structural equation modeling in two stages to examine the measurement model (for unidimensionality) and the structural model (for hypotheses testing). Findings - The study noted that knowledge sharing positively affects employees' IWB and occupational self-efficacy positively explains this association. In addition, employees' perception of entrepreneurial leadership strengthens the association between knowledge sharing and IWB. Research limitations/implications - The study collected data from a developing country during COVID-19 by using a cross-sectional design that may restrict causality. However, the findings suggest the management not only encourages knowledge sharing environment but also engages employees in various training that motivate them to experiment with new ideas and techniques.

This research explores teamwork competencies as a predictor of entrepreneurial team performance and the moderating effect of emerging cognitive and interpersonal team conflict as levers in entrepreneurship learning. Design/methodology/approach A time-lagged survey method was used to collect data from 49 teams (156 individuals) of undergraduate students in an experiential new venture creation course. A predictive model of entrepreneurial team performance through hierarchical regression analyses and moderated-moderation analyses was tested. Findings Results reveal that teamwork competencies have a significant and direct influence on entrepreneurial team performance and that intragroup conflict strengthens that relationship when high levels of cognitive conflict and low levels of interpersonal conflict emerge. Practical implications The findings have implications for the design of entrepreneurial training programs, which will benefit from interventions aimed at teamwork competency development that incorporate strategies promoting constructive cognitive conflict while preventing the emergence of interpersonal conflict.

By providing a theoretical analysis of the multi-dimensional context of learning environments, the study seeks to identify those innovative aspects that exert the most powerful influence on the impacts learning environments have on significant learning in general, and on community learning and citizen engagement in the analyzed cases in particular. The philosophically and epistemologically embedded theoretical framework model is applied to concrete case studies relying on empirical evidence accumulated in four local communities in Hungary. In 2014-15 the selected communities and their local governments participated in a nationwide project involving 77 disadvantaged small communities from geographically diverse areas of the country. The project activities generated a wide variety of community-based learning experiences, which considerably increased the interest and involvement of citizens in local strategy development and collaborative decision-making. The study explores the interrelationship and the internal dynamics between the methods and techniques that can equally be used for the purposes of interactive learner-centered adult training and local community building. The analysis is focusing on the methodological aspects of the implementation, the nature and the characteristics of the interaction addressing different players involved in the learning process taking place throughout the project cycle. The examined cases demonstrate examples of wellfunctioning and mutually beneficial partnerships between a university located in the capital city of Hungary and the participating small local communities. Innovation is also defined and evaluated in relation to the local community setting, highlighting the importance of innovation transfer. Another important aspect of the study is the overview of the possible benchmarking opportunities in order to spread local experiences in a wider circle of relevant stakeholders. By building up partnerships with local players, the local knowledge base has been enriched, and new skills have been acquired, which can serve as a basis for newly emerging learning networks. The boundaries of learning have extended far beyond the traditional educational institutions and organizational solutions. The study points out how all these factors can facilitate and strengthen positive attitudes to community initiated life-long and life-wide learning opportunities regardless of differences in educational background or social status of the potential target audience, as well as the meaningful engagement of citizens in local decision-making.

Findings The results indicate that supervisor creativity-relevant skills did not directly influence subordinate creativity. However, subordinate creativity-relevant skills and creative role identity fully mediated this association. Practical implications First, when staffing supervisory positions, organizations should consider individuals with a high level of creativity-relevant skills. Second, organizations should encourage supervisors to participate in training programs to develop knowledge and skills, in particular, creativity-relevant skills. Third, organizations should design a work environment that gives employees a substantial amount of time to interact with supervisors who have a high level of creativity-relevant skills. Finally, organizations should give supervisors opportunities for sharing their creativity-relevant skills with their subordinates.

However, this kind of traditional formal institutional arrangement inevitably has some natural restrictions and limitations. For examples, itâ€²s usually with strong universality while weak pertinence, lack of timeliness due to long application period, or difficult to find due to high cost of supervision. Those make the formal institutional arrangements not always protect the intellectual property rights well enough on some special occasions. Especially in the context of industrial cluster, the knowledge spillover is particular high due to the multidimensional proximity of society, geography, institution, organization, and cognition. Thus, there are quick imitations of products in some clusters. The traditional protection mode of patents and copyrights could not offer essential protection for intellectual property rights in the clusters because of the high requirements, the long application period, the difficulty in discovery and the trouble in litigation, which result in frequent infringement of intellectual property in clusters. That seriously harms the innovation enthusiasm and innovation vitality of cluster enterprises. Hence, in some clusters, those cluster firms have been taking collective actions based on the local conditions and industries with the help of industry association platform to protect intellectual property rights. Such an action is also called a collective action of right safeguarding (CARS) in practice. This kind of collective action plays a significant auxiliary function together with formal institutional arrangements to protect the intra cluster IPR. We are curious about what exact effects industry associations have on CARS of cluster firms. Why are there such effects? And what are the inner mechanisms by which industry associations affect CARS of cluster firms? Literature review shows that thereâ€²s still no systematic discussion of those questions in the extant literatures. In view of the above situations, this paper is going to explore the above questions in the following four steps based on the prior researches. First, this paper defines the key constructs including the industry associationâ€²s governance of IPR (IAGOIPR) and CARS. Second, theory building and hypothesis development are conducted. The specific effects of IAGOIPR on cluster firmsâ€² CARS and the mediating roles of innovation legitimacy (IL) in the aforementioned relationship are discussed. And the corresponding hypotheses are developed as well. Third, the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is used to identify the best fit model, and the developed hypotheses are tested by the best fit model with SEM. Lastly, in combination of alternative measurements and alternative logit regression, the robustness of the results is tested to confirm the findings. By doing so, itâ€²s expected to reveal the relationship between IAGOIPR and CARS, and the internal linking mechanism between them. As a result, three findings are emerged. Firstly, the IAGOIPR can effectively promote cluster enterprises to participate in and carry out CARS. The IAGOIPR activities include service governance, coordination governance and self-discipline governance. The more efficient the activities are, the higher the efficiency of the intellectual property governance of the industry association, the higher the willingness and enthusiasm of the cluster enterprises to participate in the CARS, and the better the efficiency of intellectual property protection in the cluster. From this point of view, this paper proves that the efficiency of intellectual property protection in industrial clusters is closely related to the efficiency of the local industry associationsâ€² intellectual property governance. Secondly, the IAGOIPR helps improve the innovation legitimacy of cluster enterprises (regulatory innovation legitimacy, normative innovation legitimacy and cognitive innovation legitimacy). That is to say, the IAGOIPR activities in the cluster can raise the cluster enterprisesâ€² awareness to abide by laws and regulations, social ethics and peopleâ€²s cognitive laws in their innovation activities or innovation process, so that the innovation behavior and innovation achievements of the cluster enterprises are satisfactory in the local social constructing value, norms and definition system. Thirdly, the regulatory innovation legitimacy and the cognitive innovation legitimacy play mediating roles in the relationship between the IAGOIPR and the CARS of cluster enterprises. This means that the IAGOIPR stimulates the CARS partly through the mediation of the regulatory innovation legitimacy or cognitive innovation legitimacy. The mediating role of the cognitive innovation legitimacy is the most significant, whereas the mediating effect of the regulatory innovation legitimacy ranks the second. However, the hypothesized mediating effect of the normative innovation legitimacy is not supported by the empirical research.

This can provide opportunities to firms from emerging economies who try to enter the world stage of automotive production, provided they can react to this more nimbly than established competitors. How technological change affects the supply chain coordination of incumbents from developed economies and new entrants from emerging economies should strongly determine the speed of competitive reaction. By using the example of automotive transmission development, the purpose of this paper is to provide a conceptual model for the analysis and offer research propositions. Design/methodology/approach The authors build a conceptual model based on information processing theory and offer research propositions based on case study evidence of four automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and five suppliers. Findings The authors find symptoms of two larger trends: increasing specialization and technological linkages and a need to increase external supply chain integration beyond traditional structures. Comparing the effects on Japanese and German incumbents, the authors find that increasing external supply chain linkages proves to be harder for Japanese OEMs. Tight links and routines in the Japanese supply chain networks may harm OEM efficiency under the new technological conditions, e.g. the lack of complete part specifications and high demands for customization. Looking at effects on emerging market firms, Chinese OEMs use quasi-open modular production settings in transmission development and lean strongly on inputs from specialized foreign tier-one suppliers. Speed advantages must be weighed against long-term disadvantages of dependence and insufficient R&D investments. Research limitations/implications The study explores how technological change affects inter-firm development processes. The authors propose a framework and hypotheses based on information processing theory and link the findings to the discussion on the impact of national institutional context on supply chain coordination. Practical implications OEMs wanting to adapt complex existing internal structures to the changing demands for information processing should focus first on improving internal capacities by improving the amount and richness of information flow. Implementing new standards for simultaneous and standardized software development across the supply chain is a key point for this. A second step should be to boost the internal capacity to process higher richness of information, i.e. to understand the meta-knowledge necessary to integrate across technological areas in the development of electronic control units (ECUs). Originality/value The authors draw on original interview data in developed and emerging markets and information processing theory to explore the complexity of inter-firm coordination in automotive supply chains.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/BIJ-03-2016-0039,WOS,Journal

Based on the assimilation learning theory of cognitive structure and the planned behavior theory, the purpose of this work is to analyze the relationship between innovation and entrepreneurship education (IEE) and entrepreneurial intention from the perspective of educational psychology, to explore the influence mechanism of IEE on entrepreneurial intention, and to promote the success of college students in entrepreneurship. In this study, questionnaires were conducted among college students of different colleges, majors, and grades in Anhui province, with the aid of multiple linear regression analysis and mediating effect model analysis. The results show that IEE has positive effect on entrepreneurial intention. In addition, entrepreneurial knowledge plays a mediating role in the relationship between IEE and entrepreneurial intention. And the mediating effect of innovation behavior and entrepreneurial attitude is not obvious.

With reference to the Bayesian theory, this study provides a dynamic policy conversion method through various context settings. Furthermore, this study attempts to present an empirical research paradigm. Design/methodology/approach Matland's ambiguity-conflict model is applied to explain the problems and reform paths of China's waste management policy implementation. Integrating structure discovery and bibliometrics into qualitative analysis, this study used search data from literature search engine with specific themes to achieve structure learning of Bayesian network with key factors refined in waste management policy. Findings The results show that China's waste management policy implementation belongs to symbolic implementation with high ambiguity and high conflict. Four basic conversion paths for the waste management policy are proposed, which are classified by length and stability. Then, it is possible to locate the factors, paths and types of policy implementation through involvement analysis with features of each path and each district of policy implementation. Public education holds direct but unstable impact on waste management. Economic incentives hold continuous but gradually diminishing impact. Perceived policy effectiveness plays the crucial role like a central bridge. Resident conditions have a positive impact, which could be enhanced through economic development of China. The impact of subjective norm on waste management is not significant. But subjective norm has the potential breakthrough for solving stagnation of waste classification policy. However, the impacts from each factor may change along with economy growth and technology innovation. Originality/value This study uses the ambiguity-conflict model to position China's waste classification policy and suggests that structure discovery methods help understand feasible reform paths for reform policy. The integration of theoretical analysis and quantitative simulation can achieve a comprehensive analysis of problems and solutions in waste management policy implementation of China. Promotion and education, economic incentives, perceived value, behavior control, subjective norm, perceived policy effectiveness, informal waste recycling system and residential conditions are explored as key factors for waste classification policy implementation as a representative in waste management policy. The role of each key factor and features of each conversion paths are integrated to position reform paths in the ambiguity-conflict model. This work helps to explain the stagnation of waste management policy implementation from the perspective of dynamic structure evolution, and some specific suggestions to get out of stagnation are proposed.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJCMA-09-2017-0109,WOS,Journal

It investigates KOL as an antecedent of KS. Furthermore, it also examines the mediation of employee goal orientation in the relationship of KOL and KS. Moderating role of emotional intelligence is also examined. Design/methodology/approach Multilayer data were collected from 223 employees of pharmaceutical industry in Pakistan. Structural equation modelling (SEM) is applied to analyse the model and hypothesis. Findings The result supports the direct positive effect of KOL on KS. Indirect effect of KOL on KS through the mediation of employee learning goal orientation is also supported by the result. Practical implications Organizations or managers should engage their learning-oriented employees newly hired employee and front line manager in KS process. Leader should give different task to such an employee who did not perform earlier because in doing so, such employee will explore or exploit their own tacit knowledge and that of their colleagues. Originality/value This study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by establishing unexplored indirect effect of KOL on KS through the mediation of employee goal orientation. By discussing goal orientation as an outcome of KOL, this study extends the literature of the outcomes of KOL, which are currently limited to KM, work attitudes and innovative performance.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JKM-01-2018-0033,WOS,Journal

But in India and other third world countries, healthcare monitoring is poor compared to other countries in the world, in spite of it being affordable. The global healthcare smart wearable healthcare (SWH) devices market is expected to rise up at a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 5.6% and by 2020 it is expected to reach 25 Billion (GVR Report, 2016). The growing incidences of lifestyle diseases, sedentary lifestyle, busy work schedules, technological advancements in healthcare monitoring devices, and increased usage of remote devicesseems to be some of the important factors fuelling this growth. Some of the major players in this segment are Abbott Laboratories, Philips Healthcare, Life Watch, GE Healthcare, Omron Healthcare, Siemens Healthcare and Honeywell International Inc. etc. But in spite of the healthcare monitoring devices are being predicted to be technologically innovative and providing advanced as well as basic health care monitoring features and available in various price ranges based on the features, we wanted to empirically study the attitude towards adoption of such devices in India. India has traditionally been having a very lackadaisical attitude towards healthcare monitoring. In such a context, what would be the factors influencing the adoption of SWH devices. Remote health monitoring can enhance the nature of wellbeing administration and to lessen the aggregate expense in human services by maintaining a strategic distance from pointless hospitalizations and guaranteeing that the individuals who need critical consideration get it sooner. This empirical investigation would provide a detailed insight as to how these wearable Internet Of Things devices would bring about a revolution in the healthcare industry. It would also provide the future prospect of IOT devices in this sector and how the probability of increase in its usage can be increased with time. The paper explores intrusiveness (INTR), Comfort (C), perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (EOU) of SWH devices. The study hypothesized the Impact of PU and EOU, INTR and C on attitude and intention to use towards adoption of SWH devices. Partial Least Square Structured Equation Modeling (PLS â€“ SEM) methodology was applied to explore the relationships between the concepts and hypothesis. The data was collected from 273 respondents. The age group of the respondents was between 25 and 40 years. The results indicated that intrusiveness and comfort do not have a significant direct impact on Intention to use BI (Behavior Intention) BI SWH devices. At the same time Intrusiveness had a significant impact on PU of SWH devices and Comfort has a strong significant impact on PU and EOU of smart wearables. The research has strong implications in the current emerging context of smart wearables, their design and effectiveness. Also the research can have lasting implications on elderly health and well-being. There are very few empirical studies in the area of SWH devices. Most of the studies till now are conceptual studies or providing technology architectures and frameworks. The research in this area is still at a very nascent stage and very few studies have been done to explore the use and adoption of SWH devices.

Projects are temporary structures and are underpinned by different mechanisms than stable organizations, and projects have been pointed to as contexts where there is a high potential for knowledge production, learning and innovation. In addition, increasingly both public and private organizations with a stable structure also govern a portfolio of projects for tasks that are not standardized and part of the hierarchical permanent organizational structure. However, limited empirical research have recorded the knowledge dynamics between the stable and temporary structures in such hybrid organizations. We have collected data longitudinally, in real time, in two Professional Service Firms (PSFs) to observe how learning experiences obtained in terminated projects affect current project work and to what extent current project activities shape future strategies. PSFs are specialised knowledge intensive firms such as law, accounting or engineering firms, and firms within financial or management consulting. An increasing number of scholars is looking at this particular type of knowledge intensive firms to understand both issues related to the management of human capital and knowledge, and the dynamics involved in knowledge development as a source of advantage. The performance of the PSFs is based both on the ability to attract and recruit good professionals, on reputation, and on references and experiences from previous projects. In PSFs the norm is to organize work in projects. Theory on learning from projects problematizes the opportunity to learn from projects due to their temporality. In contrast, our findings suggest that the projects themselves are the very mechanisms that connect what the organization already knows with what the organization attempts to become. The projects need to relate to both the permanent structures of the organization and the shifting body of individual expertise involved as input to project delivery. Simultaneously, the project activities - aimed at solving client challenges also foster multiple situated learning outcomes and build client relations and brand recognition. We reveal how different learning processes occurring between the stable organizational structures and the portfolio of temporary project structures and offer a model identifying 4 main microprocesses. The four micro-processes provide the opportunity to distinguish between the phases of exploration and exploitation that are involved when professionals utilize both professional knowledge and organizational capabilities in their daily project work. Moreover, the ability to distinguish between project resources and outcomes",2017,,WOS,Conference Paper

In total, 33 rural coastal villages were studied for different uses of ecological indicators in seasonal predictions based on oceanographic parameters, hydro-geological, astrophysical, meteorological and biological conditions. We focused on oral dialects from traditional fishing practitioners, local community leaders and fishers as efficient respondents to carry out the study. In addition, we also attempted to develop a template of seasonal ecological calendar based on ecological indicators of Tamil Nadu coastline. This conceptualisation can also be absorbed on a synoptic scale as an integration framework of ITEK and scientific innovations. On the other perspective, it is so factual that adaptation of ITEKs in the current decades is in verge of extinction due to several factors such as modernization, technological advancements and waning intergenerational knowledge transmissions. In the face of losing ITEKs, it is crucial to integrate ITEKs in the scientific seasonal forecasting of environmental changes and climatic events to facilitate better decision making policies on adaptation and mitigation strategies. It is highly essential to build the concept of conservation and documentation of ITEK to solve the climate crisis and effective decision making. In the recent years, the approach of integrating biophysical and social sciences on understanding earth science is an emerging concept to enhance climate knowledge. Application and integration of ITEKs with scientific ecological modelling systems possess tremendous potential to develop accurate scientific forecasts and reliable future predictions.",2019,,WOS,Journal

Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on the data collected from a sample of 165 modern service enterprises located in the Yangtze River Delta region. The authors conducted a structural equation modeling analysis using SPSS and MPLUS to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings - The results showed that different kinds of open innovation activities had different impacts on the path to radical innovation. Inbound open innovation activities directly influenced radical innovation while the effect of outbound open innovation activities on radical innovation combined with the organizational exploitative learning ability is indirect. Similarly, the empirical results also proved that customer knowledge management had an indirect effect on radical innovation through the organizational learning ability, and the influence of the exploratory learning ability was more prominent. Originality/value - Under the background of the national innovation driven by the development strategy, this paper studies the impact mechanism of radical innovation from the perspectives of open innovation and customer knowledge management.

Design/methodology/approach - All hypotheses have been empirically tested by using structural equation model to analyze the quantitative data from a questionnaire survey covering 73 CFPTs in China. Findings - Results indicate that knowledge leadership positively moderates the relationship between cognitive conflict and CFPT innovation. This moderating effect is directly or indirectly revealed by the dual mediating roles of task-related information/knowledge elaboration and affective conflict, which are two processes manifesting whether cognitive conflict can or cannot be incorporated into team innovation. Research limitations/implications - Despite the external validity of results limited by convenient sampling method, the findings offer implications for promoting CFPT innovation. This can be achieved by developing competent knowledge leadership into team sensegiver, dissent reconciler and facilitator to accentuate benefits of cognitive conflict in information/knowledge elaboration and attenuate the likelihood of escalating to affective conflict. Originality/value - This study advances the understanding of why cognitive conflict has an equivocal effect on team innovation in the context of CFPT by originally revealing how leaders' role in information/knowledge management acts as a contingency and suggesting the dual mediating mechanisms that reflect the contingent impact.

It does so by identifying factors that constitute the joint provider/customer co-creation platform, distinguishing them from factors that facilitate customers' independent value creation; and exploring benefits and potential opportunities for each party. Design/ methodology/approach - Insights were gained by using a qualitative approach involving 33 face-to-face interviews with bank managers (15) and their customers (18) in Saudi Arabia. Content analysis was performed on the data and the two sets of views integrated to compare the reality of service-for-service with theoretical assumptions. Findings - The analysis identified 65 topics, clustered to 12 themes. Three themes represented joint, collaborative activity (problem solving, relationship building, and knowledge and learning) whilst other themes identified facilitation actions by banks. Key opportunities to increase mutual value (service-forservice) emerge from extending interaction via the co-creation platform but additional benefits from these opportunities are not currently realized by participants. The authors thereby note the potential of a service focus but suggest that the locus of value creation will not readily shift from the provider to a collaborative process of co-creation. Research limitations/implications - The qualitative nature of the study limits generalizability. However, the authors expect that the hierarchy of service-for-service will be meaningful in other contexts. Future research may use it as a starting point for identifying innovations from co-creation, how actors realize and measure service-for-service, and how different business models may strengthen value opportunities. Practical implications - The findings provide managers with first, three areas of emphasis to gain and extend mutual service-for-service from direct interactions in everyday banking transactions. Second, the study emphasizes resource characteristics that will facilitate value enhancement for firms and customers by recognition of barriers to collaborative actions, and approaches for pursuit of service-for-service. Originality/value - This study establishes the joint and essential firm/customer co-creation platform in retail banking and distinguishes the platform from other customer value-facilitation actions. The authors integrate the findings with previous literature and present a conceptual framework for levels of service-forservice in exchange. This framework shows a hierarchy of key benefits for providers and customers, and highlights increasing complexities that hinder the reality of achieving service-for-service opportunities arising from the joint co-creation platform.",2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JSTP-11-2014-0247,WOS,Journal

Under the dual effects of profit-seeking behavior and information barriers, the relationship between the sticky wages of technological innovation talents (TIT), as the most profitable labor force, and technological innovation efficiency (TIE) has become more complex, and so far we still have a limited understanding of it.

The results show that the overall Chinese TIE is relatively low, and in the central and western regions the TIE has been seriously reversed; there are also divergences in the TIE at different stages in the regions we focus on. As the output of technological innovation, except for initial results (such as patents), the more important value is whether it has an ability to transform the initial results into production, and the core of it is whether it can match the market environment and technology transfer system (for example, market mechanism, transformation incentive mechanism, and institutional mechanism). So, considering these aspects, the central and west of China are obviously insufficient, while the east has obvious advantages; this can also explain the results of spatial diffusion, namely, in the eastern region it is higher than in other areas, but the gap between them is gradually narrowing; lastly, from the perspective of synergy, the wage stickiness of TIT in the central region is larger than that of the eastern and western regions, and the evolutionary relationship in the former is ""extruding"" while in the latter it is ""cooperative."" Mainly due to the popularity of the eastern innovation network and the initial state of the west, the barriers of information transmission are relatively low, while the central part is undergoing economic transformation, so its extreme demand for TIT has pushed up the cost of information transmission.

As the output of technological innovation, except for initial results (such as patents), the more important value is whether it has an ability to transform the initial results into production, and the core of it is whether it can match the market environment and technology transfer system (for example, market mechanism, transformation incentive mechanism, and institutional mechanism). So, considering these aspects, the central and west of China are obviously insufficient, while the east has obvious advantages; this can also explain the results of spatial diffusion, namely, in the eastern region it is higher than in other areas, but the gap between them is gradually narrowing; lastly, from the perspective of synergy, the wage stickiness of TIT in the central region is larger than that of the eastern and western regions, and the evolutionary relationship in the former is extruding while in the latter it is cooperative. Mainly due to the popularity of the eastern innovation network and the initial state of the west, the barriers of information transmission are relatively low, while the central part is undergoing economic transformation, so its extreme demand for TIT has pushed up the cost of information transmission.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10114201,WOS,Journal

Given the substantial contribution of SMEs to national economies, the present paper explores what factors tend to be associated with the success of EU-supported innovation by SMEs in Poland during its early post-accession period. Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual model relating the type of innovation, investment purpose, funding type and financial readiness, location and collaboration possibilities, company size and sector of operation to changes in the capital base, employment, unit price and revenue is proposed. This model is operationalised and estimated as a structural equations model and estimated using a sample of 110 SMEs surveyed in 2008 in the Greater Poland (Wielkopolska) region in Poland. Findings - Two approaches to the successful use of innovation support have been observed among the studied companies. The first approach implements market innovations to establish a presence in foreign markets and to move the product or service up the value chain. The second approach uses the funding to derisk workforce expansion and increase production capacity. Originality/value - The paper provides the first systematic disaggregate level analysis of an early post-accession context where impacts of EU support for SME innovation are decomposed into effects of specific investment conditions and innovation type on changes in capital base, employment, unit price and ultimately revenue. The insights provided here are valuable for managers developing business and innovation strategies on the one hand, but also for policymakers responsible for creating an entrepreneurship friendly environment in emerging economies.",2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JRME-04-2017-0011,WOS,Journal

The authors investigate how entrepreneurial ingenuity is enhanced by self-imposed ethical constraints, by using a case study of sustainability-driven technology enterprises in an emerging economy. The authors find that self-imposed ethical constraints can enhance entrepreneurial ingenuity because they encourage entrepreneurs to solve more complex problems as a result of considering the impact of the business on a more diverse set of stakeholders. The aim of this study is to show that while additional resources are normally considered an advantage, a dearth of resources can be a source of competitive advantage leading to ingenuity. By self-imposing ethical constraints, founders increase engagement of stakeholders who shape the firmâ€™s industry toward greater sustainability knowledge. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used semi-structured interviews which are typically the most important data source in the Gioia methodology because they provide both retrospective and present accounts by individuals experiencing the phenomenon of theoretical interest (Gioia et al., 2012). The authors focused on founders at each enterprise who had sufficient knowledge to speak comprehensively and authoritatively about their organizations. The goals of the semi-structured interview protocol were to focus on the research question, avoid the use of terminology that could lead interviewees in their answers and maintain flexibility to explore spontaneous themes during the interviews. Findings: The authors examined the influence of entrepreneurial ingenuity on the creation of knowledge in an organization's environment. They defined entrepreneurial ingenuity as a type of organizational ingenuity (Lampel et al., 2014a, 2014b) and by focusing on the role of ethical constraints, examined the conditions under which it is influenced. They emphasized that ethical constraints warrant consideration in the knowledge management process (Rechberg and Syed, 2013) because they can stimulate entrepreneurial ingenuity. The authors also investigated the relevance of ethical constraints for founders of social enterprises in Brazil, an emerging economy of growing interest to knowledge management scholars. Research limitations/implications: This study brings the following three main contributions. First, by incorporating the scope of social entrepreneurship, the research contributes to the perspective that both ethics and innovation can positively coexist within an organization while contributing to knowledge management creation and success (Borghini, 2005; Schumacher and Wasieleski, 2013). Second, the authors establish ethics as an important type of constraint that can spark ingenuity and help break through the constraints of bounded awareness for knowledge management (Kumar and Chakrabarti, 2012). Third, by highlighting the role of self-imposed ethical constraints, this study helps answer a recent call for research on â€œentrepreneurial actions that benefit othersâ€ (Shepherd, 2015, p. 490) addressing â€œWhat are the constraints that disable or obstruct an organizationâ€™s normal routines from alleviating human suffering?.It could be less about whether it is good or bad to ignore constraints and more about which constraints are ignored and which are abided byâ€ (Shepherd, 2015, pp. 499, 501, emphasis added). Practical implications: In this study, the authors show that entrepreneurs facing ethical dilemmas experience a unique cycle of equilibration, essentially throwing customary norms of equilibrium into disequilibrium. Treating ethics as both a lever and a constraint allows a more unique set of problems to be solved through knowledge management and entrepreneurship, so solutions to these problems can themselves become new sustainability-driven businesses. Social implications: This study opens up several opportunities for future research. The authors conducted a study with five sustainability-driven enterprises from Brazil. New research may benefit from examining a larger number of organizations in other countries to investigate potential environmental differences that affect ingenuity and knowledge management. This study highlights the notion of ethical constraints as enabling mechanisms, and thus self-imposed ethical constraints merit a more systematic consideration as a key additional factor that may inspire disruptive innovation (Christensen, 2013), blue-ocean strategy (Kim and Mauborgne, 2004), as well as value-creation for stakeholders (Tantalo and Priem, 2016). Originality/value: Resources are critical to both knowledge management and entrepreneurial activity and have been examined from numerous perspectives (Alvarez & Busenitz, 2001; Barney, Wright, & Ketchen, 2001; Moustaghfir and Schiuma, 2013). Entrepreneurs following a creation strategy depend less on accumulating existing knowledge and resources before beginning, and more on forming new knowledge or relationships that do not yet exist. They do this through a process of entrepreneurial trial and error (Alvarez & Barney, 2007, 2010). From a knowledge management perspective, individual knowledge sharing through both experimentation and learning by doing provide consistently high levels of knowledge sharing (Burns, Acar and Datta, 2011). This research emphasizes that constraints, such as limited resources and self-imposed ethical standards, can be a source of advantage leading to ingenuity and knowledge creation.

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 200 IT firms and partial least squares structural equation modelling was used to analyse the data of this study and to test the research hypotheses. Findings: The results revealed that both customer involvement in social media and top management support (TMS) for social media had a significant impact on OI adoption. However, only the relationship between TMS for social media usage and OI link was mediated by knowledge management capability. Practical implications: This study stresses the importance of social media policy development for business managers to create an interactive platform for their customers to participate in the activities of the firm. Moreover, the results suggest that for developing open knowledge management capabilities, leaders must focus on and support the use of social media technologies by the firms. Originality/value: Social media technologies have taken the world by storm. Organisations and individuals are influenced by the knowledge available on Web 2.0 platforms. Most of the current research has focussed on the impact of social media use on OI in developed countries, but developing nations on the Asian continent have been left out of this discussion. Moreover, while most studies have focussed on the OI outcomes, less efforts have been directed towards understanding and exploring the OI antecedents.

The study demonstrates how crowdsourcing as an open innovation mechanism is operationalised within a complex PM context. Specifically, the study seeks to understand how crowdsourcing as a novel form of OM improves key outcomes. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted exploratory research involving five pure-play crowdsourcing firms based in the USA and Australia. Findings The findings indicate that the firms practise a form of crowdsourcing that allows flexible, efficient and low risk operations and links to contemporary notions of PM such as projectification and project society. The crowd can be used in a new manner to boost success factors tied to PM through open innovation and operational novelty. In terms of OM, crowdsourcing offers flexibility, speed, dynamism and scalability to project processes. Research limitations/implications This research is based on five case studies. Further fine-grained, longitudinal research is required to fully understand this phenomenon in a wider range of contexts. Practical implications The paper contributes to practices tied to open innovation and provides guidance on how organisations might use large crowds to enhance PM success. Originality/value The study represents early scholarship on crowdsourcing and project operations. It makes three contributions. First, the authors introduce a new theoretical framework linking PM and novel aspects of crowdsourcing to extend understandings of projectification, as well as open innovation frameworks. Second, the authors showcase the flexibility and fluidity of the crowdsourcing project process.

Evidence from China's banking industry,JOURNAL OF INNOVATION & KNOWLEDGE,,10.1016/j.jik.2022.100219,"In the context of developing FinTech innovation, a commercial bank's use of FinTech innovation can improve its risk management capability, thereby reducing its risk-taking. This paper explores the impact and mecha-nism of a bank's FinTech innovation on its risk-taking using panel data of 65 commercial banks between 2008 and 2020. We innovatively construct a bank-level index based on web crawler technology and obtain the annual numbers of news items about a bank's FinTech innovation from each bank in Baidu News. The empirical results show that improvement in the bank's FinTech innovation significantly reduces its risk -tak-ing. To overcome endogenous problems, including measurement errors and omitted variables, we use the instrumental variables (IV) and difference-in-differences (DID) methods to test the hypothesis and obtain consistent estimated results. The mechanism analysis shows that banks rely on FinTech innovation to reduce their risk-taking by improving their operating income and capital adequacy ratio, optimizing their operating performance, and improving their risk control capabilities. Further, a heterogeneity analysis shows that the effect of a bank's FinTech innovation in reducing its risk-taking is more pronounced in larger, state-owned, joint-stock, and highly-competitive commercial banks. Our research results still hold after a series of robust-ness tests, including changing the construction methods of the bank's FinTech innovation index, replacing the bank's risk-taking indicators, tail-shrinking treatment, and changing samples. Our findings provide micro evidence for the application of FinTech innovation in commercial banks to reduce their risk-taking. (c) 2022 The Authors.

However, little research has systematically explored the key issues of GB in developing countries. This study has revealed the green technical capabilities and barriers to GB in Thailand from the perspectives of consultants, architects, and engineers, using a questionnaire survey and a case study. The results show experience in meeting the combined requirements of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) and the green building rating system that Thailand developed in 2010, Thailand's Rating of Energy and Environmental Sustainability (TREES), and ""skilled in energy systems"" to be the top two most important green technical capabilities. Barriers to GB mainly arise from financial pressure, technical limitations, and inadequate promotion. ""Lack of motivations from owners"" and ""high initial cost"" are ranked as the top two barriers to green building. The results collectively reveal that market demand and technological advancement are fundamental drivers for the GB industry, and the government, economic conditions, education, and corporate social responsibility are the other stimuli for the industry. The findings can help project participants adopt appropriate strategies to boost GB in emerging markets in developing countries. Future policies should focus on increasing market demand, encouraging green technology innovation, and reducing the cost of development and construction of GB.

Design/methodology/approach This study is based on empirical data collected from a survey of 210 companies and their supply chains in mainland China. Structural equation modeling is used to test the proposed relationships. Findings The findings show that SCF significantly mitigates the SCR, which subsequently has a significant positive effect on OP (e.g. operational risk and operational performance). The findings also show that when ED is high, the relationship between SCF and SCR is stronger and vice versa. Moreover, SCR mediates the relationship between SCF and OP. The hypothesis regarding the moderating effect of ED on the paths joining SCF and SCR was also supported. SCR has a significant negative effect on OP. However, the hypothesis regarding the effect of ED on SCR was not supported. Research limitations/implications This study has some limitations. First, this paper conducted the research with Chinese organizations. This may result in low generalizability in other contexts. In addition, this paper used the survey method and cross-sectional data design in this study, which may generate the potential issue of common method bias. However, the findings of this study will help organizations across China and other emerging economies to adopt SCF as a secure financing mechanism to enhance working capital and mitigate risk. In addition, the paper provides some new managerial insights for decision-makers in organizations, while exploring different factors such as SCF, SCR and ED and their effect on the organization.

The study aims to incorporate multiple views, i.e. green innovation theory (GIT), the green institutional perspective (GIP) and the natural-resource-based view (NRBV), to develop a comprehensive model to explore why and how firms implement green product innovation (GPI). Design/methodology/approach: The study explores the relationships among institutional pressure, the firm's green resources and GPI. The research also distinguishes two different types of GPI: exploratory GPI and exploitative GPI. A total of 270 valid questionnaires were collected from electrical and electronics manufacturers in Taiwan. The authors employed structural equation modeling (SEM) using analysis of moment structures (AMOS) 23.0 to test the hypotheses. Findings: The results show that institutional pressure has a significant positive correlation with the firm's green resources. Furthermore, institutional pressure has a significantly positive influence on exploratory GPI and exploitative GPI, respectively. The firm's green resources also have a significantly positive effect on both exploratory GPI and exploitative GPI. In addition, institutional pressures have significantly positive indirect effect on both exploratory GPI and exploitative GPI. Research limitations/implications: Economic benefits and environmental sustainability are the most pressing issues faced by the electrical and electronics industry today. The study's investigation covers Taiwanese electrical and electronics manufacturers only, so the test of the research model has limited generalizability. The authors suggest that to expand the generalizability of the findings, future research should examine this model in the context of other regions such as Southeast Asia, Africa, South America, etc. Practical implications: The study has many interesting implications for both practitioners and policymakers. The authors' findings suggest that while Taiwanese electrical and electronics manufacturers face significant pressure from customers, competitors and regulation requirements (e.g. waste electrical and electronic equipment [WEEE], restriction of hazardous substances [RoHS] and energy using product [EuP] directives), firms in that sector should efficiently and effectively deploy their green resources and then perform proper GPI (e.g. exploratory GPI or exploitative GPI). These results also serve as a reminder to policymakers that balancing coercive (command-and-control) mechanisms with incentives and voluntary mechanisms is the best means by which to develop motivational and effective GPI policies. Originality/value: First and foremost, the paper divides GPI into exploratory GPI and exploitative GPI. Furthermore, the research incorporates two important schools of thought, i.e. the GIP and NRBV, thus providing a more holistic view by which to explore why and how companies adopt GPI.

Based on the comparative institutional framework, it asks whether Chinese state entrepreneurship has a comparative disadvantage because of its incoherent institutions in liberal or coordinated economies. Hence, does the Chinese institutional system of innovation lag behind that of US or liberal countries of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) economies in the transformation of national science into economic products measured as high-technology exports? Design/methodology/approach: This study uses panel data analysis based on 29 OECD economies and the Chinese economy over 23 years. Regarding national science productivity (explorative capabilities), it includes published and patented science streams; regarding technological transformation (exploitative capabilities), it measures the percentage of high-technology exports in gross domestic product (GDP). The interactions between the types of entrepreneurship and national science institutions serve as predictors in the design. Findings: The results show that Chinese state entrepreneurship has a comparative advantage over liberal economies in published science. However, Chinese state entrepreneurship has a comparative disadvantage compared to liberal entrepreneurship in patent science. Regarding the dyadic level of comparability between the national economies, there are mixed results in the transformation of national science. Research limitations/implications: This study supports the three following theoretical points: national institutions differ regardless of the pressure of convergence through globalization; national science contingencies influence different paths of the transformation of national science to technology; and mixed economies, such as state entrepreneurship, can achieve high performance without fully conforming to liberal markets. Practical implications: This study emphasizes institutional mechanisms for future research to support the innovation of incoherent institutions and suggests the benefit of cross-pollination of senior managers between state and private organizations for a defined duration. Originality/value: Theoretically, this research combines an interdisciplinary and interinstitutional level of analysis, and in so doing, it deals with the transformation of national science in scientific publications and patents in the vertical value chain. Empirically, this study links the national published and patented science with the national economic artifacts in high-technology sectors. This novel approach to assess the national and discipline-level interaction sets a context for the future research in other settings. It also informs policy decisions regarding the growth of science, innovation and development. Â© 2019, Tariq H.

Through the exploration of the use of sustainable, iterative circles in a manufacturing environment, this paper explores their role in facilitating customer-focused innovation practices. Other supporting antecedences for innovative behavior are reviewed, and their combined effect upon delivering cost-effective product developments are assessed. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected through semi-structured interviews in manufacturing organizations from the automotive industry. Interviews were conducted with senior functional managers to interpret the application of sustainable, iterative development circles. Analysis of the data was undertaken via thematic analysis based upon pertinent and emergent themes. Findings: Sustainable, iterative development circles overcame the inherent path-dependency of traditional linear development approaches, whereas, traditional approaches structure the involvement of key business functions, iterative circles facilitate more flexible approaches to product development that more closely met the requirements of the customer, especially when those requirements are in a state of flux. Practical implications: This iterative, customer-centric approach to product development reflects the increasingly dynamic market environments in which manufacturing organizations operate. Using this approach helps to focus the organizationâ€™s attention upon customer requirements rather than the challenges of adhering to the rigid dogma of a chosen development methodology. Originality/value: This study proposes a new approach toward the development of innovations in manufacturing organizations utilizing the sustainable, iterative circles, and therefore, contrasts with the traditional, linear development methodologies that are usually employed.

The purpose of this paper is to explore a work-based learning (WBL) model, based on systemic negotiations between actors from the three parties: the academy, the industry, and the students. The purpose is to investigate how teachers, supervisors, and students value negotiated WBL as a boundary activity and to enhance the understanding of the learning potential at the boundary. Design/methodology/approach - Activity theory is used as a lens to analyse the results from a survey to the three stakeholder groups and interviews of students. The four learning mechanisms are used to explore learning at the boundary between the two activity systems. Findings - Diversity and mobility in education and work addressed by the notion of boundary crossing are associated with both challenges and a learning potential. There is a constant dynamic between structure and agency, where structure, the negotiated model, influence the individual agency. When gradually removing scaffolding students can as boundary crossers engage behaviourally, emotionally, and cognitively and have agency to handle contradictions at a local level. However, they did not seem to prioritise both systems equally but instead they were gradually socialised into the activity system of the industry. Originality/value - When WBL is framed by a negotiated partnership it can manage and customise inherent conflicts of interest and enhance individual learning opportunities at the boundary and can be conceptualised as an open learning practice.",2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/HESWBL-01-2015-0003,WOS,Journal

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationships between internal environment, external environment, knowledge exploitation, knowledge exploration and university performance. Design/methodology/approach This study applies confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling to test the conceptual model in the Chinese education system. Findings The findings confirm the higher impact of internal environment on both knowledge exploitation and knowledge exploration as compared to external environment. Knowledge exploitation is more strongly related to university performance than knowledge exploration. These results highlight the imperative role of internal university stakeholders in fostering knowledge management strategies. In addition, they encourage academicians, practitioners and policy makers to focus their attention on the impact of knowledge management models, tools and practices in universities to achieve the entrepreneurial development which, in turn, has a positive impact on individual graduates and innovation ecosystems. Originality/value The necessity to develop a more entrepreneurial university, as well as the lack of evidence of their development in emerging countries, highlights the need to investigate how specific factors and knowledge management processes are impacting the universities' performance. In fact, although previous studies provide an explanation of the impact of internal and external factors on a university's performance, contributions integrating these concepts with strategic knowledge management processes are still lacking.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/MD-11-2018-1240,WOS,Journal

One empirical context demonstrating potential for closing this gap is embodied design, wherein students learn to enact new movement patterns that instantiate mathematical schemes. Changes in studentsâ€™ perceptuomotor behavior in such contexts have been described as bearing markers of systemic phase transitions, but no research to date has characterized these dynamics quantitatively. This study applied a nonlinear analysis method, continuous cross-Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA), to touchscreen data excerpts from 39 study participants working with the Mathematics Imagery Trainer on the Parallel Bars problem. We then conducted linear regression analysis of a panel of five RQA metrics on learning phase (Exploration, Discovery, and Fluency) to identify how nonlinear dynamics changed as fluency developed. Results showed an increase in determinism from the Exploration to the Discovery phase, and an increase in recurrence rate, trapping time, mean line length, and normalized entropy from Discovery to Fluency phases. To put these dynamics in context, we qualitatively contrasted the RQA metric trajectories of two case study participants who developed different degrees of fluency. Our results support the hypothesized existence of phase transitions in the humanâ€“technology dynamical system during a math learning task. More broadly, this study illustrates the purchase of nonlinear methods on multimodal mathematics learning data and reveals perceptuomotor learning dynamics informative for the design and use of embodied-interaction technologies.

Due to the structure and access conditions associated with such data, their use for research and analysis becomes significantly complicated. New sources of Big Data are rapidly emerging as a result of technological, institutional, social, and business innovations. The objective of this background paper is to describe emerging sources of Big Data, their use in urban research, and the challenges that arise with their use. To a certain extent, Big Data in the urban context has become narrowly associated with sensor (e.g., Internet of Things) or socially generated (e.g., social media or citizen science) data. However, there are many other sources of observational data that are meaningful to different groups of urban researchers and user communities. Examples include privately held transactions data, confidential administrative micro-data, data from arts and humanities collections, and hybrid data consisting of synthetic or linked data. The emerging area of Urban Informatics focuses on the exploration and understanding of urban systems by leveraging novel sources of data. The major potential of Urban Informatics research and applications is in four areas: (1) improved strategies for dynamic urban resource management, (2) theoretical insights and knowledge discovery of urban patterns and processes, (3) strategies for urban engagement and civic participation, and (4) innovations in urban management, and planning and policy analysis. Urban Informatics utilizes Big Data in innovative ways by retrofitting or repurposing existing urban models and simulations that are underpinned by a wide range of theoretical traditions, as well as through data-driven modeling approaches that are largely theory agnostic, although these divergent research approaches are starting to converge in some ways. The paper surveys the kinds of urban problems being considered by going from a data-poor environment to a data-rich world and the ways in which such enquiries have the potential to enhance our understanding, not only of urban systems and processes overall, but also contextual peculiarities and local experiences. The paper concludes by commenting on challenges that are likely to arise in varying degrees when using Big Data for Urban Informatics: technological, methodological, theoretical/epistemological, and the emerging political economy of Big Data.

(2021),Foresighting Australian digital agricultural futures: Applying responsible innovation thinking to anticipate research and development impact under different scenarios,AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS,,10.1016/j.agsy.2021.103120,"CONTEXT: Public and private research institutions are grappling with the challenges and opportunities of embedding dimensions of responsible innovation within their research and development programs, including those seeking to transform agricultural productivity and sustainability through digital technologies. Central to meeting this challenge is building institutional, organisational and professional capacity for anticipation and reflexiveness within multidisciplinary research communities. Foresighting methodologies provide a means by which this might be usefully and practically enabled, whilst also shedding light on the broader social and ethical implications of alternative agricultural technology development pathways under uncertain environmental and industry futures. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the results of a participatory foresighting exercise undertaken as part of a large, publicly funded multi-disciplinary research initiative designed to build a common big data infrastructure to harness the benefits of the digital revolution for the Australian agricultural and land sectors. We seek to explore what role digital technology will play in the future of Australian agriculture and to consider the social and ethical implications. METHODS: We ran a one-day foresighting workshop comprised of four steps ? 1) horizon scanning to identify trends 2) selecting two drivers of change 3) producing a matrix to generate scenarios 4) building and refining scenarios. Participants explored different possible futures of farming in Australia, with a focus on scenarios involving socio-technical dimensions of digital agriculture to consider the implications of these futures for research practice and for farming communities. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Four scenarios were developed, distinguished by the interplay of two critical but uncertain drivers of change identified by participants, namely: the degree of resource security or insecurity that future agricultural enterprises are likely to experience; and the degree to which farming sectors maintain traditional farm business models and associated value chains or transition to more diverse or innovative business models. The process highlighted the need to increase the capacity and opportunity for more reflexivity in research and development, if positive outcomes were to be achieved. SIGNIFICANCE: The scenarios we produced provide a catalyst for conversation about the implications of digital technology development in Australia and globally, for industry, policy and research and development. In particular, the scenarios highlight potential changes in farm business models, decision making, and beneficiaries and inequities of new technologies and other components of food value chains. The paper also serves as a guide and prompt for others, by demonstrating one way reflexivity can be achieved in organisations attempting innovation.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2021.103120,WOS,Journal

The main goal is to examine the dissemination of I4.0 knowledge, exploring the main mechanisms for its spreading and highlighting the main factors shaping such processes. Focus is on dissemination processes in IDs active in traditional industries, which could represent the periphery of I4.0 application context. Design/methodology/approach The methodology is qualitative. Notably, this paper presents a case study of the Pesaro ID specialized in furniture/woodworking machinery sector. A total of 18 in-depth one-to-one interviews have been conducted with relevant informants from a variety of organizations within the cluster: companies, institutions and universities. Findings The complexity of I4.0 requires a combination of traditional mechanisms with innovative ones within IDs characterized by the emergence of new players, activities and resources. These changes led to three main evolving patterns: the horizon of I4.0 upgrading shows blurred boundaries in terms of sectors and geographic location, the I4.0 diffusion appears fragmented in terms of initiatives and projects by both firms and institutions and the dissemination of I4.0 knowledge pushes ID firms and institutions to pursue deliberate initiatives leading to innovative forms of collective cooperation. Originality/value This paper contributes to both theory and practice. From the theoretical point of view, this paper contributes to the literature on innovation in IDs and clusters on two interrelated grounds. First, it provides further research on I4.0 and IDs and clusters. Second, it contributes to the stream of research on knowledge creation and diffusion in IDs and clusters, providing empirically based insights over emerging local learning processes in IDs.

The study aims to incorporate multiple views, i.e. green innovation theory (GIT), the green institutional perspective (GIP) and the natural-resource-based view (NRBV), to develop a comprehensive model to explore why and how firms implement green product innovation (GPI). Design/methodology/approach The study explores the relationships among institutional pressure, the firm's green resources and GPI. The research also distinguishes two different types of GPI: exploratory GPI and exploitative GPI. A total of 270 valid questionnaires were collected from electrical and electronics manufacturers in Taiwan. The authors employed structural equation modeling (SEM) using analysis of moment structures (AMOS) 23.0 to test the hypotheses. Findings The results show that institutional pressure has a significant positive correlation with the firm's green resources. Furthermore, institutional pressure has a significantly positive influence on exploratory GPI and exploitative GPI, respectively. The firm's green resources also have a significantly positive effect on both exploratory GPI and exploitative GPI. In addition, institutional pressures have significantly positive indirect effect on both exploratory GPI and exploitative GPI. Research limitations/implications Economic benefits and environmental sustainability are the most pressing issues faced by the electrical and electronics industry today. The study's investigation covers Taiwanese electrical and electronics manufacturers only, so the test of the research model has limited generalizability. The authors suggest that to expand the generalizability of the findings, future research should examine this model in the context of other regions such as Southeast Asia, Africa, South America, etc. Practical implications The study has many interesting implications for both practitioners and policymakers. The authors' findings suggest that while Taiwanese electrical and electronics manufacturers face significant pressure from customers, competitors and regulation requirements (e.g. waste electrical and electronic equipment [WEEE], restriction of hazardous substances [RoHS] and energy using product [EuP] directives), firms in that sector should efficiently and effectively deploy their green resources and then perform proper GPI (e.g. exploratory GPI or exploitative GPI). These results also serve as a reminder to policymakers that balancing coercive (command-and-control) mechanisms with incentives and voluntary mechanisms is the best means by which to develop motivational and effective GPI policies. Originality/value First and foremost, the paper divides GPI into exploratory GPI and exploitative GPI. Furthermore, the research incorporates two important schools of thought, i.e. the GIP and NRBV, thus providing a more holistic view by which to explore why and how companies adopt GPI.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EJIM-04-2021-0217,WOS,Journal

(2017),Is the learning value of workplace-based assessment being realised? A qualitative study of trainer and trainee perceptions and experiences,Postgraduate Medical Journal,,10.1136/postgradmedj-2015-133917,"Purpose Workplace-based assessments (WBAs) were originally intended to inform learning and development by structuring effective observation-based feedback. The success of this innovation has not yet been established due in part to the widely varied tools, implementation strategies and research approaches. Using a conceptual framework of experience, trajectories and reifications in workplace learning, we aimed to explore trainer and trainee experiences and perceptions of the learning value of WBAs. Study design Trainers and trainees who had used at least one WBA in the previous year were invited to participate in semistructured interviews for this phenomenological study. We used a template analysis method to explore and compare the experiences of the two groups, using the emergent themes to develop an understanding of the impact of these experiences on perceptions of learning value. Results Nine trainers and eight trainees participated in the study. Common themes emerged among the two groups around issues of responsibility and engagement along with (mis)understandings of the purpose of the individual tools. Trainer-specific themes emerged related to the concurrent implementation of a new e-portfolio and perceptions of increased workload. Trainees associated WBA with a training structure support value but could not translate experiences into learning values. Conclusions WBAs provide trainees with a justified reason to approach trainers for feedback. WBAs, however, are not being reified as the formative assessments originally intended. A culture change may be required to change the focus of WBA research and reconceptualise this set of tools and methods as a workplace learning practice. Â© 2017, BMJ Publishing Group.

To address this need, the purpose of this paper is to present both critical and practical insights into the nature of public sector learning, based on a detailed mapping of learning in a knowledge-based public sector organization. Design/methodology/approach - A purposive case study is employed to explore learning in a knowledge-based organization facing few of the known impediments to learning. Findings - Learning occurred in a range of ways, through both formal and informal mechanisms. Four learning sites were observed: project, program, operational and strategic. Little use was made of formal evaluation products. Learning was constrained by mental models and organizational context and was, thus, found to be strongest in areas relating to the agency's core business and dominant professional expertise (international agricultural research). Research limitations/implications - The findings of the study are based on the learning experience of a single public sector organization in the applied research and development sector. Further work is needed on public sector organizations operating in a variety of situations to determine the generalizability of the patterns reported here and to develop and validate the mapping approach employed in the study. Practical implications - The mapping approach enabled parts of the organization that were not included in the learning conversation to be identified. The involvement of the researchers also precipitated learning activities and consciousness, suggesting that practically-oriented research may be a useful learning catalyst for small organizations. Originality/value - Learning in public sector organizations is usually approached through the lens of models developed in business settings. Mapping learning provides a way of showing what is learned, how it is learned, and its relationship to the public sector environment, characterized by legislation, political variables and ministerial oversight. This approach offers a way forward in the understanding and development of public sector learning.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJPSM-08-2016-0137,WOS,Journal

In general, there are few studies on the use of social media in organizations, and many of these emphasize on issues related to knowledge transfer. Although learning traditionally has been as acquisition of knowledge, increasingly researchers point to learningas-participation occurring through work collaboration. Social media promise increased opportunities for communication and collaboration, extending the context of collaboration beyond the local setting. However, there exists limited research on how social media can foster workplace learning, for example, between globally dispersed colleagues. Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on an exploratory, in-depth single case study of an international professional service firm's implementation of an internal wiki system to address the research question: how are social media utilized in an organization to foster workplace learning among its dispersed individual experts? Data are gathered in 35 semi-structured interviews, as well as documents studies and observations. Data are coded and analyzed utilizing the context and learning factors of workplace learning. Findings - The paper shows how the wiki system enables hybrid knowledge management strategies linked to virtual collaboration on daily project tasks, involving documentation, search, interaction and knowledge exchange, as well as socialization and learning from practice among dispersed groups and individuals. The learning mechanisms involved in virtual collaboration do not differ much from what is reported on face-to-face workplace learning, however, the context factors are extended beyond the local setting. Practical implications - The findings identify four determinants for using the wiki that can be of use to other organizations implementing similar virtual collaboration technology. First, the wiki must directly relate to the daily work by offering interactive and updated information concerning current project challenges. Second, the system must enable transparency in the daily project work to allow search. Third, the intention with the search is of lesser degree to identify encyclopedic information than it is to visualize individual competence. Fourth, the quality assurance of the data posted at the wiki is important. Originality/value - The study reveals how an international knowledge-based organization can utilize social media to leverage knowledge and experiences from multiple geographically dispersed projects by enabling virtual collaboration. Extant empirical research on workplace learning emphasizes on face-to-face interactions in groups, for example, when engineers, or accountants, in teams interact and collaborate at client premises. However, there exists limited knowledge concerning how workplace learning can be achieved through virtual collaboration.",2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/TLO-07-2014-0041,WOS,Journal

The first project, 'Biornametics', dealt with patterns from nature; the second project 'Growing as Building (GrAB)' took on biological growth as a specific theme for the transfer to architecture and the arts. Within a timeframe of five years (2011-2015), the research was conducted under the Program for Arts-based Research PEEK (Programm zur Entwicklung und Erschliessung der Kunste) of the Austrian Science Fund FWF (Fonds zur Forderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung). The underlying hypothesis was that growth processes in nature have not been studied for transfer into technology and architecture yet and that, with advanced software tools, promising applications could be found. To ensure a high degree of innovation, this research was done with an interdisciplinary team of architects, engineers, and scientists (mainly biologists) to lay the groundwork for future product-oriented technological solutions. Growth, as one of the important characteristics of living organisms, is used as a frame for research into systems and principles that shall deliver innovative and sustainable solutions in architecture and the arts. Biomimetics as a methodology was used to create and guide information transfer from the life sciences to innovative proto-architectural solutions. The research aimed at transferring qualities present in biological growth; for example, adaptiveness, exploration, or local resource harvesting into technical design and production processes. In contrast to our current building construction, implementing principles of growth could potentially transform building towards a more integrated and sustainable setting, a new living architecture. Tools and methods, especially Quality Function Deployment (QFD) for matching biological role models with growth principles and architecturally desired functions and a Biolab as an experimentation platform are presented. Three main experimental trajectories were explored that matched the objectives of the research: (1) Transfer from biology into architecture, namely self-growing structures (proto-steps in form of a mobile 3D printer working with local material); (2) Integration of biology into material systems, namely fragmented waste matter grown into one solid building material (mycelium); and (3) Interventions in existing architecture, namely optimization of 3D path-finding through a single cell organism (slime mold).",2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings7020032,WOS,Journal

Design/methodology/approach The concept of maturity models is adopted to support companies in developing distinctive capabilities for servitization. A systematic literature review and case study approach are employed to develop the maturity model. Findings The findings highlight 46 capabilities classified into seven categories: strategy and leadership, performance, offerings, customers, organization, network and digital technology. Furthermore, the evolutionary path is defined by combining two types of levels, i.e. capability and maturity levels, to develop these capabilities. Research limitations/implications The evolutionary path was partially validated through the application, while further investigation is required to validate the evolutionary path. Therefore, future research should investigate the further validation of the evolutionary path by conducting multiple case studies. Practical implications The proposed maturity model enables companies to not only capture the bigger picture of the required capabilities without oversight, but also determine a process for improving the requisite capabilities with feasible efforts. Originality/value Existing maturity models focused on the transition from less to more advanced services. However, recent studies emphasized that companies need to determine strategies that reflect their capabilities rather than simply move toward more advanced services.

Design: Presented as the 2018 Charles L. Schepens, MD, Lecture at the American Academy of Ophthalmology Retina Subspecialty Day, Chicago, Illinois, on October 26, 2018. Participants: None. Methods: Review of published literature and sources on creativity and innovation. Main Outcome Measures: Recommendations for future AMD research. Results: Innovative solutions to problems often seem intuitively obvious in hindsight. Yet, some problems seem impossible to solve. In the 1990s, AMD was a significant unmet need, with only destructive therapies for neovascular disease. This changed with the development of 2 therapies: (1) verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT) and (2) antiâ€“vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies, which are now administered to millions of people annually around the world. Now, we are frustrated by the lack of therapies for early and intermediate AMD and geographic atrophy. Photodynamic therapy and anti-VEGF drug development occurred through a combination of analytic thought and creative disruption through innovation. To get past our current impasse in understanding and treating AMD, we need to harness both analysis and innovation. We have many important building blocks in placeâ€”information on genetics, clinical findings, imaging, and histologyâ€”and have identified key pathways and potential therapeutic targets. Perhaps we need additional investigation, analysis, and integration to improve our understanding through work on structure/function and genotype/phenotype correlations and development of imaging and systemic biomarkers. We likely also need an innovative disruption. This innovation might be the concept that there are subtypes of early and intermediate AMD characterized by specific clinical phenotypes, genotype, functional characteristics, and biomarkers that are dependent on particular pathways and treatable with a specific agent. We need to encourage innovation in each of us within our research and clinical community. Conclusions: Although we have accumulated extensive knowledge about AMD, we are currently at an impasse in the development of new treatments. We need to continue the analytic process, but at the same time encourage innovative disruption to develop successful AMD therapies.

It also explores the role of specific institutional factors - corruption and intellectual property rights (IPR) protection - on this relationship. Design/methodology/approach In the study, co-inventor data from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) applications have been used to construct networks of technological knowledge collaboration at the country level over the years 2002-2015. Using eigenvector centrality as the dependent variable, the study uses fixed effect regression analyses on a panel of 171 countries, contributing to recent debates on knowledge networks and international cooperation. Findings Building on research in economic development, innovation and social network theory, this research finds that co-patenting with Chinese inventors is positively related to a country's centrality in global knowledge networks and that this relationship is negatively moderated by collaboration with the current most central knowledge network - namely that of the USA - suggesting a substitution effect. It also finds a partial substitution between institutional factors, IPRs protection and transparency, and collaboration with China on a country's knowledge centrality. Practical implications Regarding policymakers, the findings can be used to encourage international collaboration for increased access to new sources of knowledge that fosters innovation while keeping a close eye on local institutions, especially emerging economies that want to increase their international knowledge network centrality.

We analyzed a sample of 136 cross-sectional surveys collected from business managers of 132 medium- and high-tech firms in China by employing a structural equation model combined with moderation analysis to test our hypotheses. Our findings indicate that the second-order theoretical model fits the data well and AO, represented by a higher-order construct, positively affects IA. Instead of structural ambidexterity, balanced contextual ambidexterity and radical performance management can be effectively applied as the factors of the second-order construct; the design comprising balanced contextual ambidexterity and performance management is thus helpful in resolving strategic dilemmas. Our findings demonstrate that Chinese firms, as technology latecomers, are more inclined to conduct near-radical innovation. The risk of exploration crowding out exploitation efforts exists in Chinese high-tech firms. Furthermore, we provides greater insights into the moderating impact of intra-organizational practice on IA based on the fact that performance measurement balance (PMB) did not directly influence the achievement of IA and clarifies the positive role that PMB plays in improving IA.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.797645,WOS,Journal

The market of infrastructural developments so derived is attractive for international construction organizations, including those in China. Moreover, these developments are complex technically, culturally, and even politically. Fierce competition among international contracting organizations can be expected. Although price competition is common in construction contracting, increasing competitiveness through cost-cutting is no longer a sustainable strategy. Cutthroat pricing may provide a short-term edge in bidding, but increasing competitiveness through innovation will provide the determining advantages in these BRI projects. To engender innovation, an organization must first have the capacity to do so. It is therefore proposed that organizational competitiveness (OC) can be harvested through building organizational innovation capacity (OIC). This proposition was tested with data collected from 102 construction professionals and using structural equation modeling (SEM). A positive correlation was found in this OC-OIC relationship. It was further found that core competence is the powerhouse of OC. The adoption of appropriate company strategies and project performance were also found to be significant components. For OIC, the results show that the ability to learn, manage information, foster entrepreneurship through appropriate human resource management policies, and cultivate innovation culture are key contributors. These findings and the suggestions derived there from were further explored in a reflective study of an organization with notable innovations. It was concluded that manifesting these OIC building strategies will enhance OC and enable organization to better meet the challenges of the international construction markets. Thus, this paper also provides suggestions on how to put these strategies into practice.

Despite all the hype around it, blockchain remains at a nascent state. In the early stage of the development of an IT innovation, its success is to a degree contingent on building legitimacy around it. This seems to be particularly relevant in the context of blockchain due to the questionable reputation that its most famous application, the bitcoin, has gained over time. This paper explores the usage of social media by four key actors in the blockchain ecosystem -media, IT, financial services and consulting firms - over a calendar year and through the lens of 'organizing visions' to identify how these organizations are trying to legitimize blockchain. Our results show that these actors employ three primary legitimation micro-level strategies through two types of legitimation mechanisms - advertising affiliations with influential field level actors (pragmatic legitimacy), describing positive market responses to blockchain and emphasizing its ongoing development (cognitive legitimacy), and describing characteristics of blockchain that are in alignment with current technological best practices (cognitive legitimacy).

Thus, in view of the objective of restructuring the disciplinary group of industrial design, a new structure has been developed and implemented that could offer students the opportunity to explore problems and challenges that have real applications, increasing the possibility of acquiring competences effectively needed to practice the profession of designer. This restructuring had as its starting point the concept of Project-based learning, which is designated as student-centered pedagogy that involves a dynamic classroom approach in which it is believed that students acquire a deeper knowledge through active exploration of real-world challenges and problems. Consequently, resulting in a learning process organized into levels with increasing degree of complexity. As well, different assimilations of markets and design scenarios. Starting from the first year of the course, where students are still understanding the context of industrial design and its potentialities. At a time when their techniques, principles and methods are still very raw and basic. They are initiated in a LOW-ID and local industry context, to acquire basic skills. The second year allows embark on an intermediate level called MID-ID, with new skills in international brands approach. In the last year of the course the 3rd level is reached, HIGH-ID, with projects with the national industry. The first year of implementation of this curriculum structure showed good results. Thus, favoring a solid interdisciplinary formation with, skills and competences that allow future designers to intervene creatively and competently in a variety of fields. This process allows to progress to the next academic degree to complete and validate the entire formation of the student. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Resources and experiences may give platform owners an advantage to expand their business to new areas of possible growth. However, can the winner take it all? Or is the spandex rule - ""just because you can, does not mean you should""- valid for platforms, as well? The present study is aimed at narrowing this research gap by focusing on the innovation through brand extension impact on customer satisfaction and brand loyalty in an ever-greater area of the service sector. Design/Methodology/Approach. The partial least-squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) is applied to analyse the questionnaires and explore the relationships between the proposed research model's constructs. Findings. The results reveal that service innovation through brand extension impacts customer satisfaction and loyalty favourably. Customer satisfaction mediates the relation between innovation through brand extension and brand loyalty. Parent brand reputation intensifies service innovation through the impact of brand extension on customer satisfaction and loyalty, while perceived risk deters its effects. Customer innovativeness enhances customer satisfaction. Finally, perceived category similarity (fit) augments customer satisfaction while impacting loyalty negatively. Practical Implications. The findings provide a deeper understanding of innovation and brand management in digital platforms and forge a promising path forward for marketing researchers investigating the platform economy. Originality/Value. Little remains acknowledged regarding the theoretical interface of innovation through brand extension in the digital platform sphere and its consequences on customer behaviour. Building on this lacuna, the authors adopt an underexplored object that focuses on digital platform innovation through brand extension, customer satisfaction, and brand loyalty.

Sustainability learning refers to knowledge produced to address environmental risks. Design/methodology/approach - Case study design highlighting the personal experience of participants in relation to sustainability learning. Data collected through seven face-to-face, semi-structured interviews during a six-week fieldwork. Purposive sampling was used, and recruitment was carried out through the snow balling method. Deductive and inductive logic were used in data analysis. Findings - Sustainability-focused learning only took place informally in the organization studied. The organization did not have formal systems to embed sustainability learning in its rules, processes and practices. It was also found that organizational politics acted as an impediment to sustainability learning, as people in power often blocked support for sustainability related initiatives. Research limitations/implications - Data would have been richer if more than one case study was developed, as this would have enabled inter-organizational comparisons and richer analysis. Practical implications - This research is useful for practitioners, as it contributes to a better understanding of desirable sustainability learning practices and processes, and challenges that prevent it from occurring effectively in organizations. Social implications - This research contributes to a better understanding of sustainability learning in an emerging economy such as Brazil. The implementation of sustainability learning practices in emerging economies poses particular challenges given their emphasis on economic growth. Understanding these challenges can enable managers working with sustainability to formulate better strategies to ensure a smoother transition to a sustainable future. Originality/value - The originality of this research is twofold: first, it examines sustainability learning in the specific context of a government institution in an emerging economy; second, it draws attention to organizational politics as a major impediment to the systematic implementation of sustainability learning practices.",2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJOA-02-2015-0842,WOS,Journal

(2019),Knowledge sharing in the automotive sector: A comparative study of chinese and brazilian firms,Production,Automotive; Brazil; China; Knowledge sharing,10.1590/0103-6513.20180084,"Paper aims: This research aims to evaluate factors that influence knowledge sharing in automotive production context in Brazil and China. Originality: Despite the growing recognition of the factors that enable knowledge sharing in organizations, our understanding about the unique challenges encountered by the blue-collar workers in a production context is rather limited. Also, the paper raises issues and challenges involved for production organizations to engage in cross-national knowledge sharing, which remain relatively under-explored. Research method: Drawing on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach, we conduct a comparative survey among the production managers in five automotive plants in China and Brazil. The AHP approach is based on Objective: Promote knowledge sharing among production workers; Criteria of knowledge conversion as Socialization, Externalization, Internalization; and Alternatives as Structure, Communication, Training, Incentive, Standard Operating Procedure, Problem Solving Methodology. The methodology focused on the 3 Brazilian and 2 Chinese automotive plants in our fieldwork. Main findings: While many authors argue that socialization (dialogue) is the key form of worker knowledge sharing, our findings indicate that workers and managers perceive internalisation as more important in the automotive context. The significant differences between Chinese and Brazilian workers on the relative importance they attributed to knowledge sharing processes and corresponding enabling factors reinforce our understanding about the challenges of knowledge sharing across cultures and lends support to a more particularistic debate of knowledge management. While automotive workers in Brazil preferred to receive more training and better incentive schemes as essential knowledge sharing support mechanisms, Chinese workers valued more standardization through structure and standard operation procedures. The study reaffirms the role of knowledge sharing in continuous improvement and incremental innovation in shop floor operations. Implications for theory and practice: In lieu of the gaps in the extant literature, this research aims to further identify and evaluate factors that influence cross-national knowledge sharing in automotive production contexts. The research addressed the gaps to promote supportive ways to provide employees interaction, best practices and lessons learning sharing.

Our main objective is to perform a systematic literature review to better understand the associations between leadership and innovation/creativity, analyzing the knowledge thus far developed that addresses the mechanisms through which the two phenomena are connected. Theoretical framework - We present and analyze conceptual definitions for the three constructs involved in our review - leadership, creativity, and innovation. We also briefly highlight the main leadership theories and perspectives, their key conceptual elements, and their interface with creativity/innovation. Design/methodology/approach - We applied a combination of systematic and narrative review methodologies together with bibliometrics, and the review is unprecedented in its focus, depth, and breadth. We examined a sample of 2,724 published articles on the L-C/I relationships, analyzing 113 papers in depth published in the top 27 management journals. Findings - We observed an accelerated growth of research on the topic. Most studies address the effects of leadership on creativity, while its connections with innovation still need to be better understood. Transformational leadership is the main perspective adopted by researchers, but there has also been an emergence of studies applying the LMX, entrepreneurial, and positive leadership approaches. While some mediators and moderators have been explored, there remains the need to build comprehensive frameworks that are able to address the complexity of the issue. Transversal study designs predominate, and the few experimental studies mostly rely on student samples. Practical & social implications of the research - We discuss the possibilities and limitations of the present knowledge, synthesize existing gaps in the research, and offer direction to further expand the knowledge boundaries. We also contribute to fostering more systematic studies, which could avoid redundancies and unbridled construct proliferation, as well as to promoting the theoretical and methodological robustness that the field deserves. Originality/value - The study applies a combination of systematic and narrative review methodologies together with bibliometrics, and it is unique in its focus, depth, and breadth, therefore making a distinguished contribution and consolidating the research with varied approaches, while also identifying gaps to inspire future research that could bring momentum to the field.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.7819/rbgn.v24i1.4151,WOS,Journal

Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 200 IT firms and partial least squares structural equation modelling was used to analyse the data of this study and to test the research hypotheses. Findings The results revealed that both customer involvement in social media and top management support (TMS) for social media had a significant impact on OI adoption. However, only the relationship between TMS for social media usage and OI link was mediated by knowledge management capability. Practical implications This study stresses the importance of social media policy development for business managers to create an interactive platform for their customers to participate in the activities of the firm. Moreover, the results suggest that for developing open knowledge management capabilities, leaders must focus on and support the use of social media technologies by the firms. Originality/value Social media technologies have taken the world by storm. Organisations and individuals are influenced by the knowledge available on Web 2.0 platforms.

Additionally, it evaluated the influence of CEO cognitive trust on the marketing innovation of small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs). Design/methodology/approach The authors empirically assessed the impact of CEO cognitive trust on SMME marketing innovation. Furthermore, the authors examined the mediating effect of governmental support on this relationship. The authors then studied a sample of 1,770 SMMEs in China by applying partial least squares structural equation modeling. Findings The authors found that CEO cognitive trust was negatively associated with marketing innovation. Moreover, governmental support has a competitive mediating effect on this relationship. Thus, while governmental support is urgently needed to enhance the marketing innovation of SMMEs, CEO cognitive trust negatively impacts this relationship. Research limitations/implications This study empirically establishes the importance of CEO cognitive trust and governmental support as antecedents in SMME marketing innovation. This contributes to the knowledge base of the management field, adding to important streams in the wider business literature, such as marketing studies, leadership management, strategic management and innovation. While the model is parsimonious, the relationships it highlights are robust and can be generalized to other contexts. Practical implications Managers must not only have high levels of trust and authority but must also embody these characteristics rationally. Simultaneously, managers must actively establish a trusting relationship with the government, thereby improving their company's ability to integrate government policy information while also actively seeking governmental support. These measures are helpful in enhancing the marketing innovation capabilities of SMMEs. Social implications SMMEs occupy an important position in all countries' economies and their vitality directly determines the strength of the economy. Formulating reasonable marketing strategies will help enhance market competitiveness and promote the rapid development of SMMEs. Originality/value The literature on marketing innovation has paid little attention to CEO cognitive trust, while CEOs' cognitive characteristics are an increasingly relevant antecedent in SMME marketing innovation. This study analyzed CEO cognitive trust as a possible antecedent of marketing innovation activities in SMMEs, with this influence path being evaluated. This study extends the current knowledge in this field by considering the effects of CEO cognitive trust on marketing innovation.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JKM-06-2021-0454,WOS,Journal

In this study, our objective was to examine if and how the learning-centered leadership of principals influenced academic optimism of teachers and the resulting effects on their engagement in professional learning. More specifically, we examined this hypothesized set of leadership effects among teachers and principals in high schools located in Thailand. Design/methodology/approach The study was conducted with 1,763 teachers and 152 principals from 159 randomly selected, medium size secondary schools located in Thailand. The research employed multi-level structural equation modeling and bootstrapping analyses in order to test and explore these relationships in a mediation model of school leadership effects on teacher professional learning through academic optimism. Findings Results of this study reinforce prior research which has found that principal leadership can have significant direct and indirect effects on the professional learning of teachers. This finding is important because, as elaborated earlier, scholars believe that teacher professional learning is a key to sustainable improvement in schools. More specifically, our results extend prior research in two ways. First, as the first study to link Learning-Centered Leadership with Academic Optimism, this study extends findings that point to the role of school leadership in sustaining a culture of academic optimism in schools. Second, this study also established Academic Optimism as a mediator through which school leadership supports Teacher Professional Learning. Research limitations/implications Although our results support a positive conclusion concerning the effects of school leadership and academic optimism on teacher learning, this was a cross-sectional study. Therefore, caution must be exercised before drawing causal attributions. For example, research has also found that teachers who work in schools that evidence features of a professional learning community are more likely to have a greater sense of collective teacher efficacy, a variable that is also associated with Academic Optimism. Therefore, although our study proposed Academic Optimism as the mediator and teacher professional learning as the dependent variable, it is also possible that this relationship could be reversed or reciprocal (i.e. mutually reinforcing). Future research should continue to examine these possibilities using longitudinal and/or experimental research designs that enable clearer delineation of causal relationships. We also suggest the utility of qualitative and mixed methods studies capable of exploring in greater depth the mechanisms through which school leadership contributes to productive teacher learning. Practical implications There is a need in Thailand, and elsewhere, to redefine the formal roles and professional standards of school leaders to include learning-centered practices. These standards should be embedded into the redesign of pre-service and in-service education programs for teachers and principals. We believe that, at present, relatively few school leaders in Thailand genuinely understand the meaningful impact they can have on teacher learning, and by extension, on student learning. Thus, there is a need for systemic change that recasts the nature of leadership expected from principals as well as the level of lifelong learning expected of teachers. Originality/value The findings from this research contribute to an evolving knowledge base on how school leaders influence teacher learning in different national contexts. The research also extends prior research by exploring the role of academic optimism as a mediator of school leadership effects on teacher learning.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JEA-12-2019-0222,WOS,Journal

However, there are still challenges in understanding the cognitive structure of evolving R&D processes. The study of the patent landscape can provide a complementary perspective on the trajectories of technological change and facilitate interdisciplinary discussions that help make future technology planning more rationally. In this study, we investigate the technological development trajectory of post-lithium-ion battery technologies based on the analysis of patent data. A data-driven approach, which comprises of patent co-classification analysis, application of link prediction algorithm and text mining technique, is used to highlight the recent research progress on selected post-lithium-ion battery technologies. These are lithium air, lithium sulfur and sodium-ion batteries. A lithium air battery is composed of a lithium metal anode, a porous carbon cathode with high catalytic activities towards electrochemical oxygen reactions, and either an aqueous or non-aqueous electrolyte. Similarly, a lithium sulfur battery consists of a lithium metal anode, a sulfur composite cathode, and an organic electrolyte. Sodium-ion batteries share the same architecture as the lithium ion-batteries, but are normally based on carbonaceous anode materials, layered transition metal oxides cathode demonstrating a minimal structural change upon intercalation, and aqueous electrolytes. The results indicate that the number of patents related to postlithium-ion battery technologies has noticeably increased since 2008. A few East Asian countries and USA dominate the underlying patent landscape. The co-classification analysis showed that not only the amount of interacting knowledge areas but also the cross-linking with adjacent technological knowledge areas has increased. Moreover, the knowledge areas related to the electric vehicles and polymer applications are predicted to gain more relevance in the future. According to the text mining results, the most common application areas comprise vehicles, devices, energy storage, computers and phones. The main innovations of this study are as follows: First, it identified the current research trends and prospects for the post-lithium-ion battery technologies based on the insights gained from objective data, assisting R&D planners in determining their further directions for research and development. The exploration of the technological development trajectory of post-lithium-ion battery could serve as a reference for relevant researchers to better understand the dynamics and make strategic adjustments, which have profound significance for the progress of clean energy and green chemistry development. Second, it discovered the dynamics of interacting knowledge areas, which indicate an increased tendency of technology convergence. In case of lithium air and lithium sulfur batteries, notable interactions between knowledge areas pertaining to the core battery components (cell configurations and electrolytes) and application-driven knowledge fields (electric vehicles and phones) were observed. The intensity of these interactions was rather weak in case of sodium-ion battery technology. Accordingly, researchers need to seek for new knowledge outside of their traditional knowledge boundaries to accelerate the commercial breakthrough of post-lithium-ion batteries. In particular, knowledge areas related to electrical vehicles have gained in importance in all of the examined battery technologies, reflecting the drive to produce high-energy battery systems. Third, it predicted the knowledge areas that could gain more relevance in the future research by comparing the predictive power of different machine learning algorithms. This forward-looking approach can add a new empirical perspective to the discussion of sustainable technology development. Fourth, in contrast to common assumption, it showed that SIBs could also power up portable applications like mobile devices or electric vehicles. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Second Life may be a useful medium for simulating and testing geo-physical and social manoeuvres using the modeling tools. This may allow for collaborative decision-making in simulations which can prepare or rehearse people for emergency conditions. It may be useful in an emergency with information streamed and coordinated at a single online site. A shared network like Second Life may be shared by many people co-synchronously or a-synchronously, despite their geographic distance. Second Life applications may also be useful in the aftermath of emergencies for design and rebuilding, for analytical and educational purposes. Research limitations/implications - It is clear that social networks like Second Life provide a valuable tool with which to learn about and share data and information about bushfires, community emergencies and safety precautions in a social setting. It can also provide, at the local level, a forum for community information and discussion, as well as for counselling and reconstruction in the aftermath. Practical implications - The authors suggest that the range and flexibility of tools and their excellent geographic visualization and social networking functions may in future allow for learning and decision-making among diverse and disparate groups who can come together in virtual space. It is especially useful in remote communities as a means of uniting people who are otherwise isolated by distance or trapped in emergency situations. Second Life is useful for sharing information, organizational and local knowledge about disaster and mitigation management. This media-rich platform is valuable to a community that is increasingly adept with shared, 3D graphic computer interfaces. Social implications - Applications like Second Life may provide a space where users can access a range of tools as a means of informing, educating, empowering and warning participants in emergency scenarios, both real and simulated. They are more than virtual spaces; they are also social spaces. A platform like Second Life may provide a virtual solution for such communication challenges especially where communities are too remote, too dispersed or even too many in number to be easily accessible in the field. Originality/value - This paper contains new and significant information about emerging communication systems and platforms that may be of use to those researching and planning around disaster management, mitigation and resilience. It addresses the use of new techniques which are the result of innovation in technology, software design and network design. It applies a discussion of these techniques to several hypothetical and real-life scenarios to explore the potential for virtual tools as a way of providing enriched information, mapping and communication tools across a range of disaster response scenarios.",2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJDRBE-08-2013-0032,WOS,Journal

Design/methodology/approach: Regression analysis is used to test the direct effects and the moderating roles of financial and power incentives. It screens 685 listed companies from Chinese stock market, with the time window from 2016 to 2018. Findings: CEOâ€™s knowledge breadth has a significant impact on innovation strategy, but the moderating effects of power and financial incentives are not significant. CEOâ€™s knowledge depth is negatively correlated to corporate innovation strategy; moreover, power incentive significantly strengthens the relationship, whereas financial incentive significantly weakens it. Research limitations/implications: Firms are suggested to optimize CEO knowledge structure and organizational incentive system for better implementing innovation-driven development strategy. Originality/value: It is beneficial to the exploration of the micro-mechanism that enables corporate innovation strategy. Scholars may gain additional insights into the strategic management of corporate innovation from the perspective of CEOâ€™s knowledge structure.

In this context, policy-makers and organizations are increasingly interested in fostering entrepreneurial competences to improve the success of policies and venture capital investments. This paper aims at identifying the core relevant entrepreneurial competences, mapping the current literature and the main clusters and going beyond toward a meta-competence framework. Design/methodology/approach The research approach is a literature review, combining bibliometric, network and content analysis. The sampling process was conducted in the Scopus and Web of Science databases. The bibliometrics and content analysis were performed with a computer aid approach applying VosViewer1.6, Ucinet and NetDraw 2.139. The content analysis approach was performed considering a detailed coding schema developed. Finally, toward the meta-competences framework, the study applied quantitative analysis on the coding schema, particularly cross-tabulation, core-periphery and network analysis. Findings The results show the state of the art concerning entrepreneurial competences. The research identified a list of 98 entrepreneurial competences. Finally, the study proposes a meta-competence framework and clusters the 33 core entrepreneurial competences previously identified. Originality/value The proposed conceptual framework exploring meta-entrepreneurial competences offers an original contribution with implications for theory and practice. The research contributes to broadening the understanding of the entrepreneurial competences, helping on the creation, design, development and improvement of entrepreneurship educational initiatives, which are important to entrepreneurs' educators. The proposed framework contributes by providing relevant knowledge for the policy-makers' strategy formulation processes. As implications for the practice, the proposed framework can allow better assessment process for incubators and accelerators, besides more robust ventures considering learning trails based on meta-competences frameworks.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJEBR-02-2020-0079,WOS,Journal

Design/methodology/approach: This study used structural equation modelling to test the data from 3,125 engineering professionals in the Australian Public Service (APS). Findings: The structural model indicated that leadership for innovation and ambidextrous culture for innovation influenced workplace innovation which, in turn, improved career satisfaction. Moreover, modelling revealed a significant relationship between ambidextrous culture for innovation and career satisfaction. This study also investigated mediation effects and revealed both simple and sequential mediation paths in the model. It was found that improving workplace innovation and career satisfaction through recognition of an engineerâ€™s contribution to their agency would assist in retaining and advancing in-house engineering expertise. Practical implications: The structural model could be used to address current shortages of engineering professionals in the Commonwealth of Australia departments. The findings emphasise the importance of Commonwealth departments providing opportunities for their engineers to engage in creative and innovative projects which enhance their professional career.

(2020),"Decolonization, social innovation and rigidity in higher education",SOCIAL ENTERPRISE JOURNAL,,10.1108/SEJ-10-2019-0074,"Purpose Reconciliation between Indigenous peoples and the Canadian plurality has stalled. While the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's (TRC) Calls to Action could be a focusing event, creating a window of opportunity for transformative social innovations; we see coalescing of interest, social capital and investment in decolonization and indigenization in the proliferation of professorships, programs, installations and statements. However, Blackfoot (Siksika) Elder Roy Bear Chief raised significant concerns that Indigenous knowledge, experiences and people are not yet seen as relevant and useful in higher education; such marginalization must be addressed at a systems level for authentic reconciliation at any colonial university. The purpose of this paper was to explore this dual goal of exploring barriers to and opportunities for Indigenous knowledges and knowledge holders to be valued as relevant and useful in the Canadian academy, using a complexity- and systems-informed lens. Design/methodology/approach Local Indigenous Elders provided guidance to reflect study purpose and target audience of academics, with an approach that respectfully weaved Westernized research methods and co-learning through indigenous knowledge mobilization strategies. This analysis extends results from a qualitative grounded theory study to explain social processes of professors and administrative leadership in a Canadian mid-sized university regarding barriers and facilitators of implementing TRC Calls to Action. This further interpretation of applied systems and panarchy heuristics broadens understanding to how such micro-social processes are positioned and influence larger scale institutional change. Findings This paper discusses how the social process of dominionization intentionally minimizes meaningful system disruption by othering indigenous knowledge and knowledge holders; this form of system-reinforcing boundary work contributes to rigidity and inhibits potentially transformative innovations from scaling beyond individual niches and moments in time. Elders' consultation throughout the research process, including co-learning the meaning of findings, led to the gifting of traditional teachings and emerging systems and multi-scale framework on the relevance of indigenous knowledges and peoples in higher education. Research limitations/implications This study was performed in one faculty of one Canadian institution; an important and potentially widely-present social process was identified. Further research is needed for greater generalizability. Conditions that led to this study are increasingly common across Canada, where at least one third of higher education organizations have explicit indigenization strategies and internationally where the rights and self-determination of indigenous peoples are growing. Social implications Insights from this study can inform conversations about social innovation in institutional settings, and the current systems' resistance to change, particularly when exploring place-based solutions to national/international questions. These initiatives have yet to transform institutions, and while transformation is rarely rapid (Moore et al., 2018), for these potential innovations to grow, they need to be sustainable beyond a brief window of opportunity. Scaling up or deep within the academy seems to remain stubbornly elusive despite attention to the TRC. Originality/value This study contributes to a growing literature that explores the possibilities and opportunities between Indigenous epistemologies and social innovation study and practice (McGowan, 2019; Peredo, McLean and Tremblay, 2019; Conrad, 2015), as well as scholarship around Indigenization and decolonization in Canada and internationally.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/SEJ-10-2019-0074,WOS,Journal

It is very relevant when AI is dramatically reshaping hiring function in the changing scenario. Design/methodology/approach: The objectives are achieved with the help of three studies involving Delphi method to explore the criteria for AI adoption decision. Followed by two multi criteria decision-making techniques, i.e. analytic hierarchy process to identify weights of the criteria and fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution to assess the extent of AI adoption in hiring. Findings: The findings reveal that information security and return on investment are considered two very important criteria by human resources managers while contemplating the adoption of AI in hiring process. It was found that AI adoption will be suitable at the sourcing and initial screening stages of hiring. And the suitability of the hiring stage where AI can be applied has been found to have changed from before and after the onset of COVID-19 pandemic situation.

Second, prior works discussed the outcomes of cocreation; however, the process mechanisms are still under-explored, this study thus aims to explore these process mechanisms that drive value co-creation in the agro-food industry. Design/methodology/approach Case study is used as the method; specifically, six in-depth interviews on an agro-food company and its suppliers (i.e. farmers) are conducted, and data are analyzed using the grounded theory approach. Findings (1). Agro-food company and its rice suppliers invest different resource types and resource density, and the agro-food company is a main actor, i.e. resource investor and integrator; (2). While motivations of the agro-food company and farmers are different, they are mutually fit in the sustainability value; (3).

Building upon the ideas of transformational and transactional leadership (TFL and TAL), explorative â€“ and exploitative â€“ learning (ERL and ETL), dynamic capabilities (DCs) and intellectual capital architecture (ICA), this paper develops a model of organizational learning. The model explains how leadership styles trigger versatile learning, and how DCs and ICA of a firm influence this process. Design/methodology/approach: This paper builds upon a systematic review of the literature to develop propositions delineating the complex and poorly understood relationship between leadership styles, organizational learning and the role of DCs and ICA in this process. The paper develops multiple propositions, which together constitute an overarching framework explaining how leadership styles shape organizational learning. Findings: Leadership approaches, DCs and ICA of a firm all have a differential effect on ERL and ETL. TFL and TAL promote ERL and ETL, respectively. The presence of DCs facilitates the effect of TFL in supporting ERL but negatively influences the role of TAL in ETL. The effect of ICA is discussed in terms of knowledge stocks (generalist vs specialist), social architecture (entrepreneurial vs cooperative) and organizational capital (organic vs mechanistic). The generalist knowledge facilitates TFL â†’ ERL, while the specialist knowledge facilitates TAL â†’ ETL path. Entrepreneurial architectures are suitable for TFL â†’ ERL, while cooperative structures promote TAL â†’ ETL trajectory. Finally, organic systems facilitate TFL â†’ ERL, while the mechanistic systems promote TAL â†’ ETL. Originality/value: The key contribution of the paper is in developing a model furnishing profound insights into leadership approaches and organizational learning and the role of two critical factors.

This paper uses panel data of state-owned listed enterprises from 2008 to 2019 to explore mixed-ownership reform's influence on the green transformation of SOEs and its specific mechanisms. The results show that the diversity of mixed shareholders, the depth of mixed equity, and the restriction of mixed equity significantly promote the SOEs' green innovation. Moreover, there are distinctions in the impact of the shareholding ratio of heterogeneous shareholders on green innovation. Only the increase in the shareholding ratio of foreign shareholders has a positive correlation with green innovation. The mechanism tests indicate that the mixed-ownership reform plays a governance role in the green transformation of SOEs by optimizing the reasonable allocation of environmental protection subsidies and propelling environmental social responsibility's active performance. Our study further subdivides the significant promotion effect of mixed-ownership reform on green innovation, finding that it only exists in the SOEs in heavily polluting industries and regions with a high degree of marketization.

New multi-level insights of team relational conflict,Journal of Knowledge Management,Knowledge hiding; Moral disengagement; Multi-level analysis; Negative workplace gossip; Relational conflict; Social cognitive theory; Social learning theory,10.1108/JKM-08-2021-0609,"Purpose: Despite the recent extending research on knowledge hiding, there is still scant research on social stressor phenomena-related contextual antecedent factors and new cognitive mechanisms of knowledge hiding behaviors. To shed new light on this unexplored gap, this research explores the multi-level moderated mediation model that examines how and when negative gossip experienced by targets in the workplace induces their knowledge hiding from coworkers drawing from the lens of social learning and cognitive theories. More specifically, this study aims to evaluate the relationship between negative workplace gossip and knowledge hiding via moral disengagement, and this mediation effect is also moderated by team relational conflict as a novel boundary condition. Design/methodology/approach: This study collected multi-wave 338 employeesâ€™ data from 68 teams of cross-sectional industries in China, which were nested within teams. The collected nested nature data were analyzed by employing multi-level analysis based on hierarchical linear modeling. Findings: The results suggested that negative workplace gossip first triggers moral disengagement and thereby, leads to knowledge hiding. Furthermore, the direct positive association between negative workplace gossip and moral disengagement was strengthened by increasing intra-team relational conflict. In addition, the mediation effect of moral disengagement between negative workplace gossip and knowledge hiding was also strengthened through increasing intra-team relational conflict. Originality/value: This study first empirically examines the multi-level model using a new underlying mechanism (moral disengagement) and team-level boundary condition (relational conflict) and enriches the current literature on knowledge management and workplace gossip. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings and future research lines are also discussed, which will facilitate practitioners and academicians to curb counterproductive knowledge behavior.

(2021),The Sustainability of Knowledge-Sharing Behavior Based on the Theory of Planned Behavior in Q&A Social Network Community,Complexity,,10.1155/2021/1526199,"With the update and iteration of Internet technology, the socialized Q&A (question-and-answer) platform realizes the cross-border dissemination of knowledge with the main purpose of disseminating and sharing knowledge. Zhihu, as a knowledge-sharing platform that relies on the user-generated content model to maintain operation and the strong willingness of users to share knowledge, plays a key role in the development of the community. Currently, social Q&A platforms are facing problems such as low user participation rate and gradual decrease in the number of active users. It is very important and urgent to explore the factors that affect users' willingness to share knowledge. In response to this problem, this paper builds a theoretical model of the factors that are affecting users' willingness to share knowledge and uses questionnaire research methods to conduct research design and collect sample data and uses methods such as correlation analysis and structural equation modeling to verify the model and hypothesis. The research results show that the theoretical model of planned behavior has strong explanatory power and self-efficacy and material rewards have a positive effect on knowledge-sharing attitudes. Finally, according to some research results, this paper shows that, with the change of time, young people have different needs for knowledge sharing than before, while realizing self-worth through sharing experience, and we also hope to protect own interests and hope that there are more factors to encourage more users to share their knowledge and experience. Therefore, we propose that the platform can use incentive mechanisms to promote knowledge sharing while helping sharers realize their self-worth, improve the existing functions of the platform, or carry out activities to encourage users to participate, so as to achieve the purpose of knowledge sharing and maintain the operation of the Zhihu platform.

This paper explores the evolution of nanotechnology via an analysis of the patent co-classification from the database at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). A total of 518 patents on nanotechnology were analyzed. The trend of nanotechnology and the patents of high betweenness centrality were identified. It was found that the technical classifications of ""semiconductor device manufacturing"" and ""chemistry of inorganic compounds"" have the highest potential for future growth. These classifications have shown a stable number of filed patents and have become the mainstream in nanotechnology development since the 1980s. Furthermore, this study also showed that the patents owned by the US comprise a significant portion of the applications in the major technical classifications, which has played an important role in the evolution of nanotechnology. The results demonstrated that an analysis of the patent network can be a useful tool for both understanding and predicting the trend of an emerging technology.

Since few studies have explored the relationship between leadership and innovation in construction projects, this study fills this research gap and makes a significant theoretical contribution to the existing body of literature. Based on a knowledge-rated and resource-based view, this study aims to investigate various effects of different types of leadership on innovation performance in a construction project-based organization. Therefore, a theoretical model was constructed to explore the mediation mechanism and boundary condition of different types of leadership to improve innovation. The theoretical model was validated with empirical data covering project managers and engineers from the project-based organization in China via regression analysis and path analysis. The results show that transformational leadership and transactional leadership have some positively significant effects on knowledge sharing and innovation performance. Meanwhile, knowledge sharing partially mediates the relationship between transformational leadership and/or transactional leadership and innovation performance. Additionally, by considering different levels of social capital, transformational leadership is likely to have a strong positive impact on innovation performance through knowledge sharing. Our findings ensure a better understanding of the role of leadership, knowledge management, and social capital in the innovation process of construction projects. Therefore, project managers should promote a higher stimulation of a leadership behavior, encouraging knowledge management, and establishing the social capital, thus improving the innovation performance in the project-based organizations in construction projects.",2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su9101893,WOS,Journal

Design/methodology/approach: Two groups of CFPs were created from a previous single-case study to examine the learning paths of the two groups. Both groups were digitally competent yet differed in their ability to adapt to the increased usage of digital technologies by their customers: adaptive or conservative CFPs. Research questions addressed perceived learning needs, learning strategies to meet needs and factors that helped or hindered success. Transcripts were coded based on the five elements of a learning path, described within the learning network theory (i.e. motives, learning themes, learning activities, social context and facilities), using the Dedoose coding software. Group findings were compared to identify similarities and differences in their learning path elements. Findings: CFPs learning path elements varied individually and between adaptive and conservative CFPs. Individually, they varied in learning themes: digital or traditional customer-facing competencies and learning activities such as learning from experience, self-directed learning and learning from others. Drive and ambition emerged as a learning motive for several CFPs in both groups. Although small samples, adaptive CFPs saw a need for digital competencies and engaged in self-directed learning (e.g. solving problems and using digital technologies), more so than conservative CFPs. A positive work environment (e.g. healthy relationships and support from others) was perceived as necessary for success for both groups. Originality/value: This study sheds light on how oneâ€™s approach toward technology influences the creation of oneâ€™s learning path. It shows the increased importance of digital competencies for CFPs in a digital world and how CFPs who embrace technology develop technological savviness, solve problems using online resources and experiment with technology and systems, strive for self-sufficiency and rely on self-directed learning.

Organizations in these environments have to be agile in order to adapt their strategies and actions to be successful. While it is recognized that information technology can enable firms to be agile, there is a limited understanding of the mechanisms through and the contexts in which Information Technology (IT) enhances agility. This study examines two key antecedents of organizational agility, namely the IT competence of a firm and its innovation capacity and, examine their independent and joint effects on agility. We test our model using data collected from large firms in the US. The results provide strong support for our model. We found that firms with superior IS capabilities coupled with an aggressive IT investment orientation create digital platforms that enable them to be agile. We also found that the innovation capacity of the firm has a positive relationship with organizational agility and that firms with higher innovation capacity are better able to leverage their digital platforms to enhance agility. Our results indicate that organizational agility has a strong positive impact of firm performance. We interpret and discuss these results and their theoretical and practical implications.

In the context of the high-quality development of regional integration, the management of Lake Taihu is facing more new, complex and difficult challenges. It highlights two aspects of the water environmental improvement and water resource supply. In detail, the separate management measures on lake and land cannot effectively solve the water problems, the management responsibility divided by administrative areas fails to meet the new requirements of regional integration, and the lack of mechanism of environmental integrated protection/harness and water resources protection/sharing, all of which actually become obstacles to the integrated development of the YRD region. This paper believes that the water deterioration of Lake Taihu is not limited to Lake Taihu itself but closely related to the Taihu Basin and the intensive human activities around. To promote the high-quality integrated development of the YRD region, the systematically management and governance of Lake Taihu should be improved out linking with the perspective of lake-basin system. It means to form a multi-factor coordination of resources, environment, ecology, society, and economy etc, and to achieve a coordinated management of land exploitation and water protection and a trade-off among economic, social and natural benefits in different sub-regions. Therefore the paper suggests several practical ways: First, the government concerned should explore the way to manage the complex lake-basin system with multiple factors, so as to promote the innovative thinking on the regional ecological and environmental integration; Second, put more effort on the research, development and application of key technology of lake-basin harness, and on the formation of comprehensive scientific system of lake-basin process simulation, evaluation and management, so as to promote the technological and scientific innovation in the field of ecological environment; And third, explore the mechanisms of resource and environmental protection/harness/sharing cooperation, and green development modes as well, so as to promote the institutional innovation of the integrated development.

Yet, comprehensive research on SSP adoption by these companies, such as the handicraft organizations in Vietnam, is scarce. To supplement the inadequacy, this study takes an integrated supply chain perspective to examine holistically the critical factors affecting SSP adoption by Vietnamese handicraft organizations. Data were collected from a countrywide survey of 310 handicraft organizations with SSP adoption in Vietnam. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was employed to test the hypotheses. The findings reveal that organizational behavior and readiness impact directly on SSP adoption, whereas stakeholder pressures show some indirect impacts. The results also validate the mediating roles of organizational behavior and readiness in the adoption of SSP. By combining the technology-organization-environment framework with the institutional theory, this study successfully explains the diverse SSP adoption behaviors in Vietnamese handicraft organizations. It is the first attempt to explore the critical role of internationalization readiness in SSP adoption in the Vietnamese context. The research outcomes provide insights and references for sustainability practitioners and policymakers to promote SSP adoption that extends across the entire supply chain.

However, both the development and diffusion of innovations are subject to framework conditions not only within, but also across, multiple layers of innovation ecosystems. The design and management of foresight exercises are thus liable to addressing and serving these different layers â€” especially when the goal is to improve the performance and impact of such â€œinterconnected and interdependent systemsâ€. This paper develops further the concept of â€˜multi-layered foresightâ€™ by addressing multiple layers of innovation ecosystems in foresight design and management. We explore the implications of applying this type of foresight on improving systemic understanding, enhancing stakeholder networking and developing innovation capacities across the layers of ecosystems. The theoretical underpinnings are tested through a case study of the â€˜Personal Health Systems (PHS) Foresightâ€™ project. This project explored international future developments in the health sector, which is characterised by multiple disciplines, communities of practise, technologies, and geographical contexts. In the case of PHS the emerging innovation ecosystems are often conditioned by fragmented development communities, major barriers to market development, and duplication of efforts. The project combined analytical, social networking, online envisioning and scenario building methods to address complexity and create impact in multiple layers. Possible futures for personal health systems were explored through intense dialogues with stakeholders and a desirable future state was sketched through the success scenario methodology. The implications and strategic issues for different groups of stakeholders were outlined, enabling these stakeholders to articulate their efforts as part of a broader agenda at the multiple layers of innovation ecosystems.

Consequently, as firms launch new product development (NPD), it has become more critical to determine a method by which to integrate technology and knowledge together and to enhance absorptive capability (AC) of firms in the process of information, technology and knowledge sharing. This study thus combines the concepts of corporate social capital (CSC), intellectual capital, and AC, and discusses the influence of internal/external resource integration on technology integration mechanisms (TIM) and knowledge integration mechanisms (KIM), as well as AC's effect on NPD. Three hundred and ninety-four valid responses were collected and partial least squares structural equation modeling was adopted for data analysis. The results show that interaction ties and the shared language of CSC positively affect TIM, while human capital and organizational capital have positive influences on KIM. In addition, TIM and KIM both have significant and positive influences on AC and AC further influences NPD performance. Therefore, this study suggests that firms have to establish interaction bases for utilizing external knowledge to assist in NPD, and this can be achieved by offering a friendly environment to encourage employees to be more willing to contribute their knowledge.",2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10796-016-9629-y,WOS,Journal

Design/methodology/approach A qualitative approach with a convenience sample is adopted since there is no formal body that has accurate data about the number of companies, governmental bodies, nongovernmental organizations, universities, labs, etc. that already have adopted 3D printing. Findings The results indicate that the technological usefulness of 3D printing and its ease-of-use factor were found to be lacking among community members and governmental officials. Yet, these factors were the most influential factor affecting the spread of 3D printing technology adoption in the GCC countries. Nevertheless, the adaptation of 3D printing is not yet at the level of its global markets, nor is it used within leading companies' assembly lines. In addition, the 3D printing awareness and use increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, the adaptation rate is still below expectations due to several challenges that face the growth of the 3D printing market in the GCC countries. The most vital challenge facing 3D printing growth is manifested in governmental policies and regulations. Practical implications Companies' managers can benefit from the current study results by focusing on the factors that facilitate 3D adoption and avoiding bottle-neck factors that hinder the speed of the 3D adoption. 3D providers can also benefit by understanding the factors that affect 3D adoption and designing their machine and marketing strategy in a way that helps the intended companies to easily adopt 3D printing. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that explored 3D printing adoption on the GCC countries' level. It also adds a new flavor to the literature by exploring 3D adoption during the COVID-19 crisis.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JSTPM-02-2022-0037,WOS,Journal

This study develops a model by integrating dedication-constraint framework and self-presentation theory. The model proposes that knowledge outcomes at the post-adoption phase rely on relationship development between community members, conceptualized as commitment. The authors also hypothesize that members' perceived online self-presentation quality, theorized as personal control and social influence, serves as the key means to motivate members' commitment. Design/methodology/approach - This study used survey instrument to collect data and adopted partial least squares to test the proposed hypotheses.

(2022),How Supportive Leadership Promotes Employee Innovation under Uncertainty: Evidence from Chinese E-Commerce Industry,SUSTAINABILITY,,10.3390/su14127491,"Innovative behavior (IB) is an important issue in academic and other sectors. The increasing uncertainty caused by COVID-19 has resulted in rising job insecurity for employees in the e-commerce industry. This has jeopardized career sustainability (CS). Numerous studies have explored the influence of supportive leadership (SL) on IB, but so far there is still a dearth of research investigating the role of CS. In addition, CS must be considered because the perceived sustainability of a career has an impact on individual innovation. Therefore, based on job demands-resources (JDR) theory, we analyzed the effects of SL on IB as well as the roles of CS in IB. The mediating role of employee's perceived occupational sustainability was explored. This study investigates the associations between supportive leadership style (job resource) and employee innovative behavior (job demand). In total, 308 valid samples were collected from China. Structural equation modeling examines the construct validity and path relationships. The results show that in China's e-commerce industry, under the uncertainty brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, only when employees perceive CS can SL promote the transformation of job resources into workplace IB. That is, CS completely mediates SL and IB. This provides new information for the management of employee behavior in the current special period. The result revealed that SL improves IB through CS. Theoretically, this study fills the gap and establishes a theoretical framework for SL and IB. Practically, we offer guidance for enterprises and managers in that they should provide their employees with work resources which are good for employee CS so as to promote employees' IB.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14127491,WOS,Journal

The aim is to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. Electric vehicles with fuel-cells that use hydrogen as an energy carrier are touted to be one of the most important potential replacements of the gasoline vehicle in both future transportation scenarios and emerging smart energy grids. However, hydrogen storage is a major technical barrier that lies between where we are now and the mass application of hydrogen energy. Further exploration of onboard hydrogen storage systems (OHSS) is urgently needed and, in this regard, a comprehensive technology opportunity analysis will help. Hence, with this research, we drew on scientific papers and patents related to OHSS and developed a novel methodology for investigating the past, present, and future development trends in OHSS. Specifically, we constructed a heterogeneous knowledge network using a unique multi-component structure with three core components: hydrogen carriers, hydrogen storage materials, and fuel cells. From this network, we extracted both the developed and underdeveloped technological solutions in the field and applied a well-designed evaluation system and prediction model to score the future development potential of these technological solutions. What emerged was the most promising directions of research in the short, medium, and long term. The results show that our methodology can effectively identify technology opportunities in OHSS, along with providing valuable decision support to researchers and enterprise managers associated with the development and application of OHSS.

Design/methodology/approach: In this study, multisource data from 266 employees and their supervisors in 11 large high-tech Chinese companies were collected through a field study and an online survey. The hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling and bootstrapping. Findings: The results of this study show that leader narcissism has a negative impact on employeesâ€™ innovative behavior and that employeesâ€™ cognitive dependency plays a mediating role between leader narcissism and employeesâ€™ innovative behavior. Cognitive dependency and environmental uncertainty play moderated mediation roles between leader narcissism and employeesâ€™ innovative behavior. Research limitations/implications: In the future, longitudinal research and experimental methods can be used to avoid common method bias. Further studies could allow leaders to evaluate environmental uncertainty and explore the emotional path by which leader narcissism has negative effects on followersâ€™ innovation from social information processing theory. In addition, future studies can explore cognitive dependency more deeply from the perspectives of forced obedience and active worship. Practical implications: Organizations should warn leaders to control the dark side of narcissism and minimize environmental uncertainty to reduce barriers to innovation. Originality/value: This study constructs the path of the effect of leader narcissism on employeesâ€™ innovation through employeesâ€™ cognitive dependency in a specific context, which enriches theoretical research on the link between leadersâ€™ traits and employeesâ€™ innovative behavior.

This study examines the contingent nature of the relationship between university-industry alliances and a firm's follow-on contribution to open science in the context of therapeutic biotechnology. It integrates insights from organizational learning theory and sociology of science to explore boundary conditions of the efficacy of the organizational learning mechanism across the realms of business and academic science. Specifically, our contention is that, under certain circumstances, for-profit firms are likely to learn from their university alliance partners how to harness the dynamics of the open system of scientific knowledge exchange and embrace open science. Our contingency model elucidates the moderating role of a firm's R&D pipeline of drug candidates in clinical development and a firm's R&D expertise diversity across therapeutic categories. The empirics are based on a longitudinal analysis of a sample of therapeutic biotechnology firms in the United States over the period 2003-2010. We estimate negative binomial models to test our predictions. In support of our hypotheses, our findings indicate that reaching out to university alliances is positively related to firms' publishing with academic co-authors when firms develop stronger R&D pipeline and more diverse R&D expertise across therapeutic categories. The results of our study point to complementarities between collaborations with universities and a firm's investments in strengthening and diversifying its drug development pipeline in the process of public knowledge creation.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpim.12611,WOS,Journal

The coordination among the members of the supply chain becomes difficult when we consider the triple bottom line of sustainability in it. Moreover, the complexity increases with the change in dominance power of the respective members. However, the task of managing the channel further becomes complicated after incorporating sustainability and dominance power simultaneously into the supply chain. To fill this gap, this paper focuses on designing of mechanism and demonstration of three-echelon model to coordinate sustainable supply chain. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, the noncooperative game theoretic method has been applied for the exploration of models. The various structures of the centralized and decentralized supply chain are considered on the basis of a player's dominance power. The model uses simultaneous and sequential move games to analyze optimal profit of supply chain agents, total channel profit, green innovation level and corporate social innovation level. Findings Analytical results show that simultaneous game performs better than the sequential game. The consumer sensitivity toward green and social innovations increases total channel profit. We also proposed a linear two-part tariff contract model. The proposed model enhances the sustainability level and leads to perfect channel coordination. Using a numerical example, we present the effectiveness of multiple game structures under centralized and decentralized settings. The results reveal that channel efficiency is the highest in the two-part tariff contract followed by a simultaneous move game structure and lower in the cases of sequential move game. Research limitations/implications In this research, model setting are deterministic and there is no any information asymmetry. Therefore researchers are encouraged to study multiechelon sustainable supply chain coordination models under stochastic and information asymmetry settings. Practical implications The paper includes implications for the development of sustainable supply chain coordination model to tackle the problems of dominance power, sustainability issues and lower channel efficiency of supply chain.

Approach: There is a structural disconnect between civil society and the world of innovation. However, the exploration of the divergences between the neo-institutional and neo-evolutionist perspectives of the triple helix makes it possible to state that the evolution of funders in different contexts can generate an emerging articulation. The effects on the existing ""systemness"", particularly in Latin America and the Caribbean, will depend to a large extent on the conceptual approach adopted and on its institutionalization in terms of restructuring the systemness of innovation systems and their governance. Findings: The evolution of the relationships between emerging financing mechanisms and innovative projects in Latin America and the Caribbean constitutes both an opportunity and a risk. If ""systemness"" is restructured, the region could follow a path with high expectations; if traditional sub-dynamics persist, the emerging phenomenon could be stripped of its full potential. Contribution: A different conceptual and practical analysis of the topic of financing innovation is proposed, with emphasis on the Latin American and Caribbean case. Additionally, research paths are suggested that reduce uncertainty about the relationship between the actors of the innovation system and civil society and its potential impact.

The current rapid development of cloud resource technology and the concept of ubiquitous learning, which is characterized by personalization anytime and anywhere, has challenged the absolute teaching function of teachers and the neat and uniform teaching methods of textbooks and classrooms. Ubiquitous learning is a historical return to human learning, and teachers need to transform their roles in this change, to improve their adaptability and to become the organic driving force to realize the contemporary information aggregation structure. Based on this understanding, this paper begins with an analysis of the intelligent form of current cloud resources and explores the conceptual understanding and transformation pathways of the ecological context of ubiquitous learning and the corresponding role of teachers. In this paper, we design a system consisting of a teacher, a student, and an administrator, which can publish English test papers, create and manage a personal library of test papers, monitor students' practice status, and review students' performance. Storage management can be automated and intelligent, and all storage resources are integrated together, and customers see a single storage space. It improves storage efficiency, solves the waste of storage space through virtualization technology, can automatically redistribute data, and improves the utilization of storage space, while having load balancing and fault redundancy functions. Cloud storage can achieve scale effect and elastic expansion, reduce operating costs, and avoid wasting resources. Through the cloud platform, teachers can answer questions and assign homework for students online.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/4451210,WOS,Journal

An organizational routinesâ€™ perspective,Journal of Organizational Change Management,Case study; Innovation implementation; Management innovation; Organizational routines; Routine evolution,10.1108/JOCM-07-2016-0124,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to address how management innovations are implemented deeply at the most micro level of organizations, namely, organizational routines, or to investigate the process through which organizational routines evolve in implementing management innovations, with existing routines overturned and new routines created and solidified. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts an interpretive and exploratory case study on the case of Day-Definite (DD) innovation which has successfully brought Arima World Group Company Limited (HOAU) into a new value-added arena, in terms of timing, security and high service quality. Considering that DD innovation reflects a systematic innovation of the whole organization, this paper focuses on it to explore the complex implementation mechanism of management innovation. Multiple approaches were utilized during data collection to meet criteria for trustworthiness, including semi-structured interviews, archival data and observation; and the data analysis went through a five-step process. Findings: The results confirm management innovation as a complex project concerning organizational routines which represent a central and fundamental element of organizations. Also, it finds that organizational routines evolve in innovation implementation through a three-phase process consisting of the existing-routine-domination phase, the new-routine-creation phase and -solidification phases, each exhibiting different innovation activities and characteristics of participantsâ€™ cognition and behaviors; recreation of new routines is the key for routine evolution, thus for success of management innovations. Research limitations/implications: This research is constrained by several limitations. The set-up framework of organizational routine evolution in innovation implementation needs a further confirmation in more organizations; other elements, such as cognition of managers, resource orchestration, environmental elements or organizational culture, should be considered for the success of innovation implementation; and more attention should be paid to the potential power asymmetries among participants and its potential influence on forming shared schemata and subsequent new routines, besides interactions and role taking. Originality/value: The findings offer some valuable insights for further research on management innovation and organizational routines and hold important implications for management practices. This research extends research on management innovation and the Kurt Lewin Change Theory and Change Model to explore innovation implementation at a most micro level; furthers research on organizational routines, especially routine dynamic theory, by holding the two-component view and exploring the process through which organizational routines evolve; and contributes to research on the relationship between organizational routines and innovations by taking an organizational routinesâ€™ perspective. It reminds managers of the depth and complication of innovation implementation.

The framework is illustrated with case material from a retrospective analysis of changes in a UK university that was differentiating its mission to become the enterprise university. Making explicit the implicit ways of change management and partnership working involved in strategic transformation, the framework draws out those leadership and governance processes operating in practice. In this way, those practices and processes promoting healthy idea flow are identified as well as those acting as barriers to innovation. It is posited that the framework could support universities and other knowledge organizations to more fully advance their purpose by enhancing value creation released through social networks driving innovation. The leadership and governance model dominant in most university and industry management systems is a hierarchical, formal authority structure. While relevant to organizational resourcing, accountability and scaling, bounded hierarchy is not well-positioned to support the healthy flow of ideas necessary for successful entrepreneurial activities. Given that universities and many industries are â€˜idea factoriesâ€™, new models of leadership and governance that serve to more fully leverage the creativity embedded in the organization can accelerate delivery against the shared goals emerging from collaboration. New ways of working that better reflect the actuality of innovation and the idea ecosystem are identified, given that ideas emerge from community systems comprised of diverse individuals connecting with others in groups with ideas flowing along social networks. Peer-to-peer exchanges are inherently more agile, and engagement is characterized by idea exploration, harvesting and co-creation with idea flow across institutional barriers. New models of leadership and governance that underpin the dynamic articulation of the formal hierarchy with the unbounded community of social networks can support entrepreneurial activities and are key to securing sustainable university-industry partnerships. The model described here draws upon learning explored in executive education and talent development programs exploring institutional sustainability leadership, including approaches to driving innovation and social enterprise (undertaken in the USA, Europe and UK). New ways of working are proffered that re-frame university-industry partnerships as dynamic social networks, where ideas are exchanged and developed, supported by leadership and governance processes that promote, rather than hinder, healthy idea flow. Trustful relationships are developed over time across boundaries, both disciplinary and organizational, and support experimentation and innovation in line with the expressed shared purpose. In an entrepreneurial university, leaders at every level need to be conscious of the organizational senior management hierarchy operating as one system and the community of social networks acting as another system, and seek to understand how best to harness the creative tensions between the two systems. Rather than an organizational chart defining membership, creative and decision-making processes and systems are designed to better reflect actual interactions and idea flow throughout the organization and with its partners. Developing new models of leadership and governance that map against the stages of idea flow can serve to drive up successful entrepreneurial (and intrapreneurial) activities. In this way, entrepreneurial universities can increase idea flow within the university-industry network(s) in line with their strategic intent. Inmaking the implicit explicit it is possible to transform the behaviour of the people involved and, through them, the culture that supports entrepreneurial partnerships. The conceptual framework described here is necessarily reductionist in nature, however, mapping idea flow from successful projects and applying such knowledge to future project flows along with the associated governance processes could add atomic-level detail relevant to the organizations and projects concerned to drive healthy idea flow over the long-term. The conceptual framework is illustrated by reference to the strategic transformation of a UK university becoming more entrepreneurial as it delivered change in linewith differentiating its academic mission to become the enterprise university.

A self-designed questionnaire, consisting of 17 critical indicators of online self-regulation, project-based learning and 5-competence development, was administered to collect data from 87 college students in China. The partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze the relative factors. The results indicated that an integrated model, combining online self-regulation and project-based learning, provided a marginally better explanatory power; project-based learning had a better prediction of 5-competence development than online self-regulation. An integrated model is proposed to detect the latent relationships among the data with structural equation modeling (SEM). The SEM provides a clear picture of the relations among the variables, and shows that online â€œHelp seekingâ€ in MOOC lecture videos and engagement in â€œTeamworkâ€ in class are the key indicators of student engagement in flipped learning. This study adopted an innovative approach which emphasizes the diagnosis of studentsâ€™ engagement, and proposes an integrated model combining online self-regulation and project-based learning constructs for a theoretical framework to predict learning performance in flipped learning.

Bidding behaviors of suppliers do not always align with predictions from rational agent models due to task uncertainty and bounded rationality, which could result in non-optimal supplier offers and ultimately hurt buying firm interests. This paper aims to discuss the aforementioned issues. Design/methodology/approach The authors built an analytical model that considers the impact of supplier technological risk, buyer-supplier coordination cost and supplier loss aversion on the optimal bid of the supplier. Next, using limited information processing capacity as a theoretic lens, the authors explore antecedents to the size of a focal supplier's bidding error, the absolute difference between the actual bid and the optimal bid. The authors used quantitative lab experimental data to test the hypotheses. Findings (1) Bounded rational bidders often fail to differentiate between relevant and irrelevant competitive information when placing bids, (2) loss aversion of a bidder significantly affects not only levels of bids, particularly for bidders with competitive disadvantages, but also sizes of the bidding error and (3) competitive information that has clearer performance implications are more influential in reducing sizes of bidding errors. Originality/value The results provide a comprehensive view of the bidding behaviors of a bounded rational supplier in an innovation outsourcing context with competition. With the results, managers now have a better understanding of behavioral influencers behind non-optimal supplier bids in an innovation outsourcing context.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJOPM-01-2022-0006,WOS,Journal

The payoffs can take many years to materialize or may never come. Even though the traditional venture capital/entrepreneurial model has been shown to stimulate innovation in a wide range of technology settings (software, computers, Internet, electronics, etc.), it wasn't designed to deal with the costs, risks, and slow payout of science-based industries. Although venture capital continues to flow into industries like biotechnology, there has been a significant shift away from funding ventures at the earliest stages. A key concern is that lack of availability of future rounds of financing can shut off the flow of venture capital funding abruptly. In this article, authors Andrew W. Lo and Gary P. Pisano draw on comparisons to projects in the moviemaking industry and propose the project-focused organization (PFO) as an alternative structure for undertaking long-term, high-risk, highly capital-intensive R&D programs in science-based industries such as biotech. PFOs are entities created to conduct a specific R&D project. The authors discuss how they could work in practice, using the example of biopharmaceutical R&D. Researchers innovating in a science-based context must overcome two specific challenges. First, they need to raise sufficient capital to fund a long-term, highly risky, and very expensive project. Second, they must have a governance mechanism for allocating capital (human and financial) and conducting projects. The authors propose that governance centered on the project rather than the company may be a more efficient way to organize innovation in science-based industries. To reduce overhead, they propose contracting out for resources as necessary. As with movie projects, investors could choose projects they want to invest in, with the understanding that they will receive returns only if those projects succeed. Although the authors write that organizing innovation through PFOs has benefits for investors and companies, they say that one size doesn't fit all when it comes to organizing innovation and that many models need to be explored.

In this paper will be presented one option to foster these policies by establishing university research parks supported by Community Universities in Brazil. The interactive design innovation certainly was a step toward adopting the systemic model that basically brought an approach and focus not only businesses and market, or in research, thus recognizing a system and interaction of agents. It is understood that the political and institutional arrangements that support and streamline the scientific and technological production showed changes in their training and performance in recent years. It is at this point that the dynamics of university-industry relations, public-private-partnership (PPP), are emerging as one of the key solutions to enhance technology and foster innovation. Thus, combining scientific knowledge and technique can bring technology, new processes that influence behavior including social, economic, from one location. In Brazil, one of the trends to foster this interaction between agents is the combination of efforts between universities and the productive sector in the formation of regional university research parks. In this context, they are Community Universities, which in its constitution differ from the Brazilian public universities, as they allow for greater flexibility and agility in the development of relations with the private sector. Brazilian Community Universities represent a segment of higher education institutions, which, in addition to teaching, are directed to the community, providing various social activities for several decades. Created by civil society and the public of local government in which they operate, they have no profit, all of which earned funds are invested in the institution and in projects for the community. They are strongly recognized by the community as an important factor of development. This study aims to present the importance of creating regional policies at Community Brazilian universities to local and regional technological development, especially in the university research parks training support. On the methodology adopted in this study, we adopted the basic qualitative research where data collection was done through the analysis of documents and professional experiences. As to the objectives, it is an exploratory research in order to explain the main features of the issues addressed. The sources, it is a secondary literature, based on previously published material. The conclusions point out that the strengthening of regional technology policy is fundamental to the Community Brazilian universities further contribute to the technological development of the regions in which they operate. In this sense, university research parks, demonstrate to be an important tool for universities, allowing them a strengthening of their role and importance in the locality and likewise for university research parks that get a scientific and organizational support already structured.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on a global review of relevant architectural courses in universities, a set of green building learning behaviors was proposed and a survey was conducted in architectural schools in South China to verify the â€œvalue-belief-normâ€ theory through the lens of green building learning behaviors. The psychological path that affects studentsâ€™ green building learning behaviors was analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings: The results showed that biospheric and altruistic values could directly affect studentsâ€™ motivation to learn green building, while personal norms served as the mediating condition for personal values and beliefs, and ultimately improved motivation. Practical implications: The study suggests that the cultivation of environmental awareness and a sense of the ecological crisis should be developed through foundation courses, by establishing an ecological architecture curriculum, to more effectively guide students to learn and practice green building. Originality/value: This study, for the first time, applied the â€œvalue-belief-normâ€ theory, which was developed to explain the psychological path for pro-environmental behaviors, to green building learning behaviors of architectural students.

This study aims to identify whether BD and KM can be established in these emerging issues. We used a survey questionnaire to collect data from various firms and industries. We used structural equation modeling (SmartPLS and SPSS) to validate the research model with a sample of 155 companies in a developing country such as Indonesia. The result demonstrates a positive relationship between KEEC and BPI, followed by several significant findings such as BDAT with KEEC; KEEC on big data knowledge management (BDKM); BDKM and BPI; and BDAT on BDKM. In contrast, BDAT is nonsignificant for direct relationship on BPI, and interestingly, it becomes a significant result after mediated by BDKM. Similarly, BDKM has successfully mediated the relationship between KEEC and BPI. The management level ideally develops and increases such a knowledge creation/acquisition practices and BDAT in an organization to gain more meaningful benefits from these two capabilities. BDAT, KEEC, and BDKM simultaneously are a clear antecedent approach, which ultimately results in flexibility, effectiveness, and effectivity of BPI. The cases of this research are profit firms in a developing country such as Indonesia. A future study could be considered in different settings such as type of industries or more specific company's type, the economy level of countries (comparing between developed and developing countries), and environmental dynamical.

The authors investigate how entrepreneurial ingenuity is enhanced by self-imposed ethical constraints, by using a case study of sustainability-driven technology enterprises in an emerging economy. The authors find that self-imposed ethical constraints can enhance entrepreneurial ingenuity because they encourage entrepreneurs to solve more complex problems as a result of considering the impact of the business on a more diverse set of stakeholders. The aim of this study is to show that while additional resources are normally considered an advantage, a dearth of resources can be a source of competitive advantage leading to ingenuity. By self-imposing ethical constraints, founders increase engagement of stakeholders who shape the firm's industry toward greater sustainability knowledge. Design/methodology/approach The authors used semi-structured interviews which are typically the most important data source in the Gioia methodology because they provide both retrospective and present accounts by individuals experiencing the phenomenon of theoretical interest (Gioia et al., 2012). The authors focused on founders at each enterprise who had sufficient knowledge to speak comprehensively and authoritatively about their organizations. The goals of the semi-structured interview protocol were to focus on the research question, avoid the use of terminology that could lead interviewees in their answers and maintain flexibility to explore spontaneous themes during the interviews. Findings The authors examined the influence of entrepreneurial ingenuity on the creation of knowledge in an organization's environment. They defined entrepreneurial ingenuity as a type of organizational ingenuity (Lampel et al., 2014a, 2014b) and by focusing on the role of ethical constraints, examined the conditions under which it is influenced. They emphasized that ethical constraints warrant consideration in the knowledge management process (Rechberg and Syed, 2013) because they can stimulate entrepreneurial ingenuity. The authors also investigated the relevance of ethical constraints for founders of social enterprises in Brazil, an emerging economy of growing interest to knowledge management scholars. Originality/value Resources are critical to both knowledge management and entrepreneurial activity and have been examined from numerous perspectives (Alvarez & Busenitz, 2001; Barney, Wright, & Ketchen, 2001; Moustaghfir and Schiuma, 2013). Entrepreneurs following a creation strategy depend less on accumulating existing knowledge and resources before beginning, and more on forming new knowledge or relationships that do not yet exist. They do this through a process of entrepreneurial trial and error (Alvarez & Barney, 2007, 2010). From a knowledge management perspective, individual knowledge sharing through both experimentation and learning by doing provide consistently high levels of knowledge sharing (Burns, Acar and Datta, 2011). This research emphasizes that constraints, such as limited resources and self-imposed ethical standards, can be a source of advantage leading to ingenuity and knowledge creation.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JKM-11-2018-0707,WOS,Journal

However, data analysis negated the positive impact of political ties on frugal innovation, which remains non-significant with the introduction of sustainable leadership among Pakistani SMEs. Hence, future studies are recommended to explore other conditional factors and mediating mechanisms in the relationship between managerial ties and frugal innovation. This idea can bring a deeper insight into the vital role of networking. To the best of the author's knowledge, no prior study is available about the integrated relationships of managerial ties, frugal innovation, and sustainable leadership. This study enriches the literature in innovation management, especially concerning the social network and situational leadership model.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.948530,WOS,Journal

For latecomer countries such as China, standards, and standardization are an important means to upgrade their industrial structure. Using the framework of a sectoral system of innovation, this article leverages China's hardware industry to investigate the relationships among factors that influence the performance of industrial upgrading via standards. Expert opinions and the decision making trial and evaluation laboratory method are used to evaluate the relationships. The evaluation results show that if some firms in a system have the capability to execute standardization and innovation, with the support of the government to build and shape standardization institutions and infrastructures, the knowledge and technological capabilities of the entire industry can be enhanced, leading to the gradual introduction of high-quality standardized products into markets by firms even as they move toward more knowledge-intensive segments. This article contributes to two academic fields. First, standards are an important but often neglected topic in the innovation system literature. This article not only investigates the neglected topic but also explores the mechanism through which standards influence industrial upgrading at the meso-level. Second, several previous studies assumed that the drivers of supplier upgrades in developing countries are mostly driven by powerful buyer firms that are based in advanced countries. However, this article finds that customer requirement is not the most influential driver of the industrial upgrading of developing countries.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TEM.2019.2939909,WOS,Journal

Can We Accomplish the RIS3 Target?,"Studies on Entrepreneurship, Structural Change and Industrial Dynamics",Hurdle panel data; Public funding; RIS3; University-firm linkages,10.1007/978-3-030-47697-7_4,"The failure of the deterritorialised innovation policy addressing the regions based on the â€œone-size-fits-allâ€ policymaking made the Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation (RIS3) become the Holy Grail of the European cohesion. This policy strategy is part of a multilevel framework, which encompasses national and regional vectors harmonising transversal strategies and combining different aspects to generate a consistent policy mix. This growth strategy will reinforce the existence of an innovative and knowledge-based society, which aims to raise welfare, promote responsible practices, modernise economic activity and spread prosperity. Sustainable growth will optimise the use of resources, boost the efficiency levels, generate competitiveness and respect the environment. Inclusive growth will promote social and territorial cohesion which is sought after in the convergence policy, which has slowed down the pace after the financial crisis. The development of regional competitive advantages will rely on the establishment of relevant linkages between the Academia and the private institutions in knowledge creation and transfer. In this vein, the University is expected to play a central role, facing important challenges and requiring transformations, mostly in the case of less favoured regions. Productivity raise, construction of comparative advantages, market consolidation and profit maximisation, required to avoid the obsolescence of firms, will rely in the prosecution of innovative activities. Despite being risky, these activities are sought by firms as a source of economic performance increase, being the building blocks of a profit maximisation strategy. The velocity at which innovation occurs will differ among industrial sectors due to their singularities along with other firm structural characteristics, still, those who perform innovative activities are more prone to achieve higher standards of turnover growth and profits. The organisational competences concerning human capital, knowledge absorption, accumulation and diffusion will enhance the innovation capabilities, thus generating advantages. In this path, Universities will be determinant as they may leverage the success of the entrepreneurial innovativeness throughout the provision of relevant knowledge, productive techniques and methods. Absorbing, transforming and exploiting the general knowledge provided by the University will be the firmsâ€™ incumbency which will reflect the speed and the success of the individualâ€™s innovative performance. Considering the reinforced role of the Academia as a knowledge producer and therefore inside the innovation process, the existence of incipient connections with firms will be unbearable. What enables and hindersÂ University-firm linkagesÂ is, so far, overlooked in the literature demanding for the comprehensive analysis, in particular the causes of its failure, and the accurate policy mix that overcome the situation is vital for a successful RIS3. The singularities of this policy framework require redirection of the tools and actions to be taken such as incentives, grants, loans and subsidisation strategies. Empirical results shed light to the significant difference observed in the classification of the University as a source of information for innovation between public monies recipients and other firms. Among public funding beneficiaries, the Academia is an important source of knowledge to draw upon; conversely, for the other firms, it seems of poor importance the knowledge conveyed in the contact. In general, firms fail to consider the University as a relevant source of information for innovation, which seems to be incompatible with the establishment of smart specialisation strategies. These unexploredÂ connections, which pledge the success of the present innovation policy, and reinforce the importance of its appraisal to fully understand the determinants of University-firm linkages and its connection to public subsidisation, encompassing the identification of the most effective beneficiaries. The econometric estimations, relying on the CIS, were run considering a panel of firms operating in Portugal, which provides the empirical evidence for a moderate innovation milieu which is poorly done so far as most of the studies focus on innovation leader. The findings reinforce the existence complementarities among policy instruments and highlight that new avenues of research should explore other policy instruments such as open innovation frameworks.

An IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5Â Â°C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty, 2018). Numerous studies report the specific impact of current and projected urban overheating on the increase of the energy demand for cooling purposes during the warm period. Urban climate and the phenomenon of â€˜Urban Heat Island Intensityâ€™ (UHI) have been extensively investigated in the last decades and a lot of research has been conducted in South Europe (Santamouris, Energy and climate in the urban built environment, 2013). Moreover, the EU policies promote research and innovation actions on urban regeneration through nature-based solutions, both using and improving existing technologies to face challenges, as well as exploring more novel materials and architectural components, for improving well-being in urban areas. In this work, an evaluation of the impacts of a design proposal developed for the urban regeneration of Largo Annigoni in Florence is done to reduce heat stress at a micro-urban scale of the built environment. Simulation of microclimate conditions of the analyzed area was performed using the three-dimensional software ENVI-met for urban modelling comparing indexes of environmental comfort such as Mean Radiant Temperature, the PMV Index (Predicted Mean Vote), and the PET Index (Physiologically Equivalent Temperature). Besides, climate-adaptive design became an important tool to encourage the regeneration of contemporary cities, with a particular focus on the effects generated from the combination of innovative technologies for mitigation and adaptation to climate change of urban space.

This paper aims to explore how critical factors affect the effectiveness of horizontal and vertical CPKTand how to form the CPKT mechanism within PBOs. First, a theoretical model and 14 hypotheses were proposed based on the literature reviews and the pilot study carried out. Then, structural equation modeling (SEM) was done to examine the influencing factors and their relationships with the effectiveness of knowledge transfer according to the data collected from a survey questionnaire developed for this study. The results indicated that the project task context (i.e., temporary nature and time urgency) plays a negative role in the willingness to transfer knowledge. The organizational management context (i.e., organizational climate and incentive mechanism) promotes the increase of transfer intention, which further positively impacts the transfer effect. The trust relationship also has a positive effect on project teams' willingness to transfer knowledge. Additionally, the richness of transfer channels provides convenience for knowledge-exchange activities between projects, thus enhancing the effectiveness of CPKT. This research not only offers recommendations for project managers and company executives to promote CPKT within PBOs but also contributes to the development of a theoretical framework for knowledge-transfer theory.

Many studies have also used the construct of slack to explore how it affects a firm's innovation/performance. Even so, only a vague relationship has been drawn between a firm's slack and its corporate greening. Drawing on green innovation literature, institutional theory, and firm slack from a resource-based view, we argue that two antecedents (i.e., institutional pressure and the firm's green slack) positively influence companies' propensity to engage in green product innovation (GPI) and improve their results (e.g., green new product success, aka GNPS). In particular, this research empirically investigates the indirect relationship between institutional pressure and GPI through the firm's green slack. This study also tests the mediating role of GPI in the relationship between the two antecedents and GNPS. We test our proposed model using a sample of 170 Taiwanese high-tech firms, including both electrical and electronics manufacturers. The results of structural equation modeling analysis provide support for all direct and indirect hypotheses.

The use of new technologies has changed the way people work, and effected the design and innovation processes of firms even in more traditional sectors. In recent years research was devoted to understand the specific process of knowledge creation in the innovation process, both within an internal view or and external one. Some studies (Edvardsson & Tronvoll, 2013), consider All social and economic actors are resource integrators defining resource integration as the involved actors' activities and interactions when resources are integrated and operated upon. According such a view innovation is the result of a resource integration process (Carida et al., forthcoming). The aim of the paper is to understand which kind of practices emerges in a crowdsourcing platform. Design/methodology/approach - We adopted an explorative research approach (Dubois and Gadde, 2002) characterized by an iterative process of systematic combinations and inferences between theory and empirical contextualizations (Dubois and Gadde, 2002), such as crow-contest examples, that allow theory to be informed by reality. To address the iterative process of systematic combinations and inferences between theory and empirical contextualization (Dubois and Gadde, 2002), we analised an Italian crowdsourcing platform. We analysed in depth the case we selected to understand the different forms of interactions among the participants. The analysis was qualitative in nature and involved both secondary data (companies reports, press releases, etc.) and primary data coming from the observation of the crowd contest platform, as well as, from the codification of the crowd comments, of the contest rules, etc. Originality/value - Currently, extant research on knowledge creation has not investigated enough the interactions among customers and firms (especially according to a social perspective). We find that knowledge is a central issue in the crowdsourcing context where different practices are adopted to foster innovation. Our findings will contribute to the literature on knowledge creation in service-logic environment. Practical implications - The first results show how the platform implemented different practices, adopting practices to create knowledge. They work as a connection place and may enable different process of value co-creation depending on the specific aim of the actors. They are open systems (Vargo and Lusch, 2011; Edvarsson and Tronvoll, 2013) which favourite the interaction between different actors and then, they are site were practices take place.",2017,,WOS,Conference Paper

The paper discusses the effect logistics 4.0 innovations have on Intellectual Property (IP) management. Logistics 4.0 has marked a new era and introduced a novel concept to both industry and service communities. New entrepreneurial ideas based on different technologies are introduced which enables the digital transformation of logistics. This transformation also impacts innovation and various IP processes and its management. The approach used in this paper is exploratory in nature. The case study methodology is followed. This paper will discuss various examples of digital applications. Then a case will be selected for the analysis and categorization of innovation and IP. The categorization will take place based on different logistics 4.0 definitions as well as with concepts related to the types of innovation provided by the Oslo Manual and the IP management implications that are generated. This study has a limitation concerning the empirical part. More empirical research and studies should be conducted concerning logistics 4.0, innovation and IP management context.

The authors also investigate the relationship between performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and OLR of students. Moreover, this work examines the mediate role of learner satisfaction in the linking of OLS usage and performance in Vietnamese higher education. Design/methodology/approach A total of 558 valid questionnaires were collected from students at five large universities in Vietnam to test the fit of proposed model, measurement model and structural relationships between constructs by using partial least squares (PLS) path analytics. Findings Performance expectancy, effort expectancy and social influence have significant positive effects on OLR of students in online learning context. OLR has a positive impact on both learner satisfaction and OLS usage. The learner performance is significantly influenced by satisfaction while it is indirectly affected by OLS usage via satisfaction. In addition, OLS usage plays as a partial mediation variable in the relationship between OLR and satisfaction. The path model could explain 56% of variance of the learner performance. Research limitations/implications This study has a few limitations. First, this study is cross-sectional, which allows the elaboration of correlations between variables but lacks confidence in causality exploration. Second, the self-reported data are inherently subjective, which might generate biased results in measuring learner performance. Practical implications This research has implications for instructors and higher education organizations. The findings provide insights for instructors to manage efficiently the OLS adoption of students. Higher education organizations should understand and identify factors in terms of OLR, OLS usage, learner satisfaction and learner performance when OLSs are implemented in university.

The existence of research and innovation strategies for smart specialisation (RIS3) was set as a prerequisite for European regions to be eligible for receiving funding for European structural investment funds (ESIF). Today, the focus of European Commission (EC) is to strengthen the sustainability aspect of the smart specialisation approach. It is not enough that regions develop smart specialisation strategy as a one-time effort. The regions should ensure the establishment of continuous collaboration with the entrepreneurial actors to realize smart specialisation strategy, to assess the results of the implementation efforts and to refine strategy when needed. There has been few studies in prior research related to continuous entrepreneurial discovery process and the underlying mechanisms to sustain stakeholders' engagement. Our paper explores how regional councils in Finland facilitate continuous stakeholder interaction in the context of smart specialisation. The objective is to identify key mechanisms for continuous entrepreneurial discovery process. As key findings of our semi-structured interviews with the regional councils in Finland, we identify the development of specific frameworks and tools, the establishment of horizontal and vertical innovation networks and the integration of smart specialisation in regional development cycle as key mechanisms to facilitate continuous stakeholder interaction. Our work contributes to current debate on conceptual underpinnings of continuous entrepreneurial discovery process. We also provide practical examples for other EU regions how to sustain continuous stakeholder interaction in the context of smart specialisation.

An organizational routines' perspective,JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT,,10.1108/JOCM-07-2016-0124,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to address how management innovations are implemented deeply at the most micro level of organizations, namely, organizational routines, or to investigate the process through which organizational routines evolve in implementing management innovations, with existing routines overturned and new routines created and solidified. Design/methodology/approach - This paper adopts an interpretive and exploratory case study on the case of Day-Definite (DD) innovation which has successfully brought Arima World Group Company Limited (HOAU) into a new value-added arena, in terms of timing, security and high service quality. Considering that DD innovation reflects a systematic innovation of the whole organization, this paper focuses on it to explore the complex implementation mechanism of management innovation. Multiple approaches were utilized during data collection to meet criteria for trustworthiness, including semi-structured interviews, archival data and observation; and the data analysis went through a five-step process. Findings - The results confirm management innovation as a complex project concerning organizational routines which represent a central and fundamental element of organizations. Also, it finds that organizational routines evolve in innovation implementation through a three-phase process consisting of the existing-routine-domination phase, the new-routine-creation phase and - solidification phases, each exhibiting different innovation activities and characteristics of participants' cognition and behaviors; recreation of new routines is the key for routine evolution, thus for success of management innovations. Research limitations/implications - This research is constrained by several limitations. The set-up framework of organizational routine evolution in innovation implementation needs a further confirmation in more organizations; other elements, such as cognition of managers, resource orchestration, environmental elements or organizational culture, should be considered for the success of innovation implementation; and more attention should be paid to the potential power asymmetries among participants and its potential influence on forming shared schemata and subsequent new routines, besides interactions and role taking. Originality/value - The findings offer some valuable insights for further research on management innovation and organizational routines and hold important implications for management practices. This research extends research on management innovation and the Kurt Lewin Change Theory and Change Model to explore innovation implementation at a most micro level; furthers research on organizational routines, especially routine dynamic theory, by holding the two-component view and exploring the process through which organizational routines evolve; and contributes to research on the relationship between organizational routines and innovations by taking an organizational routines' perspective. It reminds managers of the depth and complication of innovation implementation.",2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JOCM-07-2016-0124,WOS,Journal

The effect of emotional brand attachment on the perceived risk of really new products,JOURNAL OF PRODUCT AND BRAND MANAGEMENT,,10.1108/JPBM-09-2018-2005,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of emotional brand attachment in consumers' evaluation of new products that represent technological innovation. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative study was conducted using survey data from a nationally representative probability sample of US consumers (n = 624) to understand the role of emotional brand attachment in the context of consumers' evaluation of really new products (RNPs). A framework was developed and tested using structural equation modeling that included emotional brand attachment, brand trust, product incongruity, product familiarity, perceived risk, willingness to try, product evaluation and word-of-mouth intentions. Findings The results support the role of emotional brand attachment in the diffusion of RNPs. Specifically, results indicated that increased brand attachment reduces consumers' perceived risk associated with a RNP and increases brand trust. Both constructs played a key role in shaping willingness to try the innovation, word-of-mouth intentions and product evaluation. Findings of this paper add explanatory power to demand-prediction models that more accurately describe the mechanism of the innovation adoption process. For marketing managers, the results emphasize the importance of consumer-brand emotional connections. Research limitations/implications The paper used a cross-sectional design; it would be interesting to use a longitudinal design to examine if the role of emotional brand attachment changes over time and how the changes might impact consumers' perceptions and behaviors in the context of RNPs.

It is possible to entertain indigenous knowledge into adult education through modelling, guided practice, and application approaches. However, there are several limiting factors to do so. Today, many indigenous knowledge systems and practices are at risk of becoming extinct because of rapidly changing natural environments and fast pacing economic, political, and cultural changes on a global scale. Considering this, therefore, this study is aimed at exploring the integration, existing practical challenges of indigenous based adult education, and forward contextual consideration from the perspectives of learning material development. In doing so, a case study research design was employed. Date was collected from adult education experts, adult literacy centre coordinators and adult learners who were drawn by using purposive sampling technique. Data were obtained through interview and FGD. Thematic analysis was placed as the centre of data analysis method. As a result, the integration of indigenous knowledge into educational programs especially in adult education has been passed with many ups and downs. The inclusion was found at a substandard level due to a lack of gratefulness and value regarding what indigenous knowledge might bring to educational practice and how it might be enacted into learning materials. Although the integration has been challenged with many barriers, fortunately, many opportunities which need to be considered are emerging. Context-based working strategies and guidelines have to be advanced by governments aim at mobilizing community support for indigenous based education development and handover to generations through revitalizing all forms of educational provision within the local and global market context.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/2294593,WOS,Journal

In addressing this gap, two related questions guided our investigation: (1) How do organizations experience and resolve contradictory tensions throughout the evolution of digital infrastructure? and (2) What can we learn about the organizational capabilities that drive strategic actions in resolving these contradictory tensions? We approach these questions using an in-depth case study at RE/MAX LLC, a global real estate franchise. Based on our findings, we propose a theoretical model of digital infrastructure ambidexterity. The model recognizes three pairs of capabilities (identifying and germinating, expanding and legitimizing, and augmenting and implanting) and two supporting factors (leadership and structure) that are key to resolving contradictory tensions during this evolution. This study responds to a recent research call for dynamic process perspectives at multiple levels of analysis.

Findings The results indicate that authoritarian leadership can positively influence perceived insider status and EIB within a certain range in Chinese organizational culture, although this is counterintuitive. In addition, perceived insider status has a high level of explanatory power on EIB and can mediate the relationship between authoritarian leadership and EIB. Furthermore, proactive personality can moderate the positive influence of authoritarian leadership on perceived insider status.

Design/methodology/approach: In total, 213 valid questionnaires from SMEsâ€™ top management positions were evaluated to investigate the proposed model of the research empirically. As a methodological approach, partial least square (PLS) path modeling approach, a variance-based structural equation modeling was employed. Findings: The statistical results imply that explorative learning has a positive impact on improvisational creativity and innovation while improvisational creativity has a positive influence on compositional creativity and innovation as well. Compositional creativity and innovation are also positively associated. Surprisingly, improvisational creativity mediates the relationship between explorative learning and innovation. Furthermore, PLS-multi group analysis reveals that heterogeneity exists in the collected data and number of employees is a moderating variable. The results of the research indicate that companies with number of employees between 51 and 100 are more creative and innovative in comparison with other groups. On the other hand, the positive relationship between explorative learning and compositional creativity was not supported in this research. Originality/value: This study is one of the few research works in the realm of examining the structural relationship among explorative learning strategy, improvisational creativity, compositional creativity, and innovation in ICT-SMEs, regarding the number of employees as a moderating variable.

But there are a series of problems in the process of technological innovation so that many science and technology enterprises can hardly get loans from banks. In August 13,2015 China State Council issued Some opinions on accelerating the development of modern insurance services(Insurance state ten for short) which proposed definitely Insurance will play an important role. Technological innovation has the characteristics of high-risk, which has a natural combination with the function of insurance. However, insurance has not play a part in every stage of S&T achievements transformation because small science and technology enterprises have huge financial pressures and business owners are not aware of such insurance. This article proposes a guidance fund for S&T achievements transformation insurance( hereinafter to be referred as the Fund) in order to further protect business owners' rights and interests. It bases on government guidance and private capital's participation, and equipped the professional risk management techniques of insurance companies. It aims at declining business owners' risks when they failed in the process of by S&T achievements transformation because the insurance can spread risks to the whole society so that it can reduce the influence of Market Failures. Meanwhile, if a science and technology enterprise have been insured, the insurance will reduce the loss which caused by the failure of S&T achievements transformation and make the company easier to gain loan from banks. At first, this paper analyses the Fund's organizational structure and mechanism which involve the necessity and disadvantages of government investment; if insurance companies take part in it will increase efficiency; designing transformable premium (premium exchanges stocks when S&T achievements transformation is achieved); how to attract private capitals and etc. And I analyse venture capitalists' expected return by setting three endings which are publicly listed, being merged and bankruptcy liquidation. Otherwise, in empirical aspect, this paper builds random effects model to analyse if insurance plays a role in S&T achievements transformation can promote success rate, and makes the conclusion compare with uninsured companies.

Design/methodology/approach Based on a case study of a new practice called 11X integration strategy in Guangzhou Pharmaceutical Holdings Limited, a Chinese pharmaceutical group in Guangdong province, through applying Grounded Theory the authors get a concise systematic framework of generation process that is more practical and more understandable than the counterparts in current literature. Findings First, this paper uncovers five stages and two parallel sub processes in the generation process of IDMI. The sub processes involves practical exploration process (i.e. primary activities) carried out by the internal change agents and theoretical support process (i.e. support activities) carried out by the external change agents. Second, by adopting a process perspective the authors are able to demonstrate how the different activities in both types of processes are combined over time in an intertwined way. Research limitations/implications First, the case the authors studied is embedded in the context of China's transitional economy, and the single case study limits us to make comparisons of the generation process of management innovation between different market economies. Second, the external-driven management innovation is still a field untouched. Third, in the research the authors explore the issues of how new management innovation is generated and implemented, but the authors do not systematically research on why different companies exhibit different levels of management innovativeness. Practical implications First, the findings suggest that firms should consciously and systematically invest in IDMI to create sustainable competitive advantage. Second, the process framework provides a clear guidance to the managers in Chinese state-owned enterprises who are engaged in developing or adopting management innovation. Third, the study indicates the managers in Chinese company should be aware of the importance of external change agents to IDMI. Fourth, this study could facilitate the enterprises to develop or adopt management innovation based on their real needs rather than just jumping on the bandwagon when adopting certain new management skills. Originality/value This study offers a new generation framework by identifying possible facilitators of IDMI that does not yet exist in extant literatures, and the two sub processes - the practical exploration process and the theoretical support process - deepen the understanding of the generation mechanisms of IDMI.

The first is the development of project management, aimed at improving the performance of innovation management, while the second, the internationalization of innovation organizations and processes in response to strategies of redeployment toward emerging countries. Both streams have been closely analyzed in the fields of project management and international management, respectively. However, the links between the two have been less studied. The purpose of this paper is to consider the hypothesis that a firm's projectification might have an important impact on its pattern of internationalization in innovation. Design/methodology/approach First, we present the models of internationalization of innovation processes used in the multinational corporation literature. This field essentially focuses on the components of permanent organizations: global internationalization strategy and legacy, R&D footprint, characterization of local subsidiaries and the role of central head offices. Projects figure only as a context in which those elements operate, not as a structuring variable of the global innovation process pattern. The authors challenge this view by exploring whether the specificities of the firm's projectification pattern can influence how it builds its global innovation process. The paper is based on a longitudinal case where the authors analyze the organizational transition within the Renault group, an emblematic case of a multinational that implemented a spectacular internationalization transition in the 2000s. Findings Our results demonstrate project organizing's major impact on the internationalization patterns of innovation processes within the firm. They show how the deployment of a polycentric innovation footprint has been the consequence of a specific projectification transition, giving the project and program functions the autonomy to transgress centralized product development norms to adapt their project to the local environment; use the initial breakthrough project as the foundation for a new and specific global product development network through a lineage logic; and sustain this innovation global network as a permanent process of the firm. Originality/value Bridging project management literature with multinational management literature. Demonstrate the key impact of projectification on internationalization pattern of the firm.

A qualitative inquiry from international consultancy alliance,INTERNATIONAL MARKETING REVIEW,,10.1108/IMR-03-2021-0111,"Purpose The current study attempts to bridge the existing gap related to the role of knowledge acquisition from international alliance partners to improve competitiveness by examining the distinct processes of knowledge acquisition and the challenges confronted in this learning process in order to enhance local and international market performance. Design/methodology/approach Following case-study approach based on systematic combining, the study presents a case of knowledge acquisition and learning in the context of an international consultancy alliance between leading Pakistani and Chinese engineering firms using six in-depth interviews of key engineers to explore the dynamic mechanisms for knowledge acquisition and learning from the Chinese firm. Grounded analysis drawn upon the Straussian version of grounded theory (GT) {{Strauss, 1990 #136} Strauss, 1998 #139} is used for data analysis in this research. Findings It was found that the processes of explicit and implicit knowledge acquisition from Chinese firms are integrated consultancy working, social and technical adaptability and seeking confirmation about the work done and knowledge/theories and models used in work. However, these processes are quite complex, posing serious challenges for National Engineering Services, Pakistan to acquire the required knowledge, which can be addressed through partners' motivation to share and acquire knowledge, cultural intelligence and friendship and informal association. The study also found that the knowledge acquired from technologically advanced international organizations by the host partner in the international strategic alliance not only provides a competitive edge to the local host in its local market but also builds its capacity to undertake similar projects in other parts of the world, substantially enhancing its market success. Originality/value Adding up to the current literature that focuses on knowledge acquisition in a parent-subsidiary relationship, the current research proposes a framework for knowledge acquisition in the unique context of international strategic alliances. The research provides managerial guidelines to manage knowledge acquisition for gaining a competitive edge that would be helpful for the managers in the era of growing interdependence among the organizations across the borders.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IMR-03-2021-0111,WOS,Journal

The organizational responses are quite heterogeneous even when the firms face similar pressure. The authors have tried to explain this heterogeneity by using innovative capability as mediating variables. Design/methodology/approach: Empirical survey data from Indian manufacturing firms are obtained to test the proposed hypotheses. The hypotheses are grounded in resource-based view of the firm. The authors used structural equation modeling approach with maximum likelihood methods of approximation. Findings: The results indicate that exploratory innovation positively influences the firms to adopt CE practices. Whereas, exploitative innovation capability inhibits the adoption of CE practices. Practical implications: This study guides business managers to focus on develop exploratory innovative capabilities before the adoption of CE practices. This study also provides guidance to policy maker about the role of regulatory mechanism plays to encourage/inhibits firms for adoption of CE practices. Originality/value: This is first study to analyze the idiosyncratic behavior of the firms when subjected to stakeholder pressure for CE practices adoption. Innovative capabilities (exploratory/exploitative) are able to explain the reason for diverse response to stakeholder response.

Indian firms which were previously catering to domestic demand are now the exporters of major agricultural machinery such as tractors and pesticides. Design/methodology/approach: Rapid growth in demand for the agricultural inputs and improvement in technology implementations have led us to study the performance and transformation of these input industries. An empirical analysis was performed on the listed agricultural input firms during 2001â€“2019 to investigate the relationship between the R&D efforts and growth of firms in the seed, pesticide, fertiliser and agricultural machinery industries using the system-generalised methods of moments (GMM) technique on the panel of 1,320 firm-year observations. Findings: The findings reveal that investments in innovations have a positive and lagged effect on the growth of firms in the Indian agricultural inputs industry. A further analysis reveals that younger firms grow faster when they invest in R&D. More specifically, the author finds evidence in the case of the agricultural inputs industry that import of raw materials negatively affects the firms' growth (FG) and export intensity (EI) positively affects the growth in the case of R&D firms. Investments in R&D are also seen to enable firms to reap benefits from externalities present in the industry. Research limitations/implications: This study suggests that the government should encourage the industries to invest optimally in R&D projects by providing favourable fiscal treatments and R&D subsidies which are observed to have positive effects in various developed countries. Originality/value: There are very few studies that have explored the impact of R&D expenditure on the firm performance in agricultural inputs industry, especially in an emerging economy context like India.

(2021),Using the antibody-antigen binding interface to train image-based deep neural networks for antibody-epitope classification,PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY,,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008864,"High-throughput B-cell sequencing has opened up new avenues for investigating complex mechanisms underlying our adaptive immune response. These technological advances drive data generation and the need to mine and analyze the information contained in these large datasets, in particular the identification of therapeutic antibodies (Abs) or those associated with disease exposure and protection. Here, we describe our efforts to use artificial intelligence (AI)-based image-analyses for prospective classification of Abs based solely on sequence information. We hypothesized that Abs recognizing the same part of an antigen share a limited set of features at the binding interface, and that the binding site regions of these Abs share share common structure and physicochemical property patterns that can serve as a fingerprint to recognize uncharacterized Abs. We combined large-scale sequence-based protein-structure predictions to generate ensembles of 3-D Ab models, reduced the Ab binding interface to a 2-D image (fingerprint), used pre-trained convolutional neural networks to extract features, and trained deep neural networks (DNNs) to classify Abs. We evaluated this approach using Ab sequences derived from human HIV and Ebola viral infections to differentiate between two Abs, Abs belonging to specific B-cell family lineages, and Abs with different epitope preferences. In addition, we explored a different type of DNN method to detect one class of Abs from a larger pool of Abs. Testing on Ab sets that had been kept aside during model training, we achieved average prediction accuracies ranging from 71-96% depending on the complexity of the classification task. The high level of accuracies reached during these classification tests suggests that the DNN models were able to learn a series of structural patterns shared by Abs belonging to the same class. The developed methodology provides a means to apply AI-based image recognition techniques to analyze high-throughput B-cell sequencing datasets (repertoires) for Ab classification. Author summary The ability to take advantage of the rapid progress in AI for biological and medical application oftentimes requires looking at the problem from a non-traditional point-of-view. The adaptive immune system plays a key role in providing long-term immunity against pathogens. The repertoire of circulating B-cells that produce unique pathogen-specific antibodies in an individual contains immense information on both the status of the immune response at particular time and that individual's immune history. With high-throughput sequencing, we can now obtain Ab sequences for thousands of B cells from a single patient blood sample, but functionally characterizing antibodies on this scale remains on daunting task. Here, we propose to use AI to functionally classify Abs from sequence alone by re-casting this classification problem as an image recognition problem. Just as traditional image recognition involves training AI to distinguish different types of objects, we sought to use AI to distinguish different types of Ab-antigen binding interfaces. Towards that end, we generated ensembles of Ab structures from sequence, and generated 2-D 'fingerprints' of each structure that captures the essential molecular and chemical structure of the Ab binding site regions, and trained a Convolution and Deep Neural Network based AI model to classify Ab fingerprints associated with different functional characteristics. We applied this DNN-based approach to accurately predict antibody family lineage and epitope specificity against Ebola and HIV-1 viruses, and to detect sequence-diverse antibodies with similar binding properties as the ones we used for training.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008864,WOS,Journal

Based on the theory of transformative agency conceptualized in a multi-level governance context, we build on recent novel inter- and transdisciplinary research in Brazil to explore the opportunities for transformation in the dynamic, complex, and multi-level field of ocean governance. We focus this analysis on three transformation processes toward developing a socially and ecologically coherent marine protected area network as the core of a marine spatial planning process for enhanced ecosystem-based polycentric governance of the country's Exclusive Economic Zone. The findings illuminate leverage points for achieving (much needed) transformation in Brazilian ocean governance and potentially beyond. These include: connecting transformative actions into coherent narratives and testing strategic advice derived from theories of transformative agency to promote regime shifts in ocean governance systems; setting of more ambitious social mobilization targets; fostering orchestration of knowledge-networks considering multiple issues, territorial and institutional levels; implementing institutional learning experiments; supporting transformational trajectories toward co-evolutionary, polycentric, ecosystem- and area-based ocean governance systems; and pursuing gradual, incremental structural understanding of a given knowledge network field as a major driver of catalyzing transformative change.

(2020),Assessing hERG1 Blockade from Bayesian Machine-Learning-Optimized Site Identification by Ligand Competitive Saturation Simulations,JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING,,10.1021/acs.jcim.0c01065,"Drug-induced cardiotoxicity is a potentially lethal and yet one of the most common side effects with the drugs in clinical use. Most of the drug-induced cardiotoxicity is associated with an off-target pharmacological blockade of K+ currents carried out by the cardiac Human-Ether-a-go-go-Related (hERG1) potassium channel. There is a compulsory preclinical stage safety assessment for the hERG1 blockade for all classes of drugs, which adds substantially to the cost of drug development. The availability of a high-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure for the channel in its open/depolarized state solved in 2017 enabled the application of molecular modeling for rapid assessment of drug blockade by molecular docking and simulation techniques. More importantly, if successful, in silico methods may allow a path to lead-compound salvaging by mapping out key block determinants. Here, we report the blind application of the site identification by the ligand competitive saturation (SILCS) protocol to map out druggable/regulatory hotspots in the hERG1 channel available for blockers and activators. The SILCS simulations use small solutes representative of common functional groups to sample the chemical space for the entire protein and its environment using all-atom simulations. The resulting chemical maps, FragMaps, explicitly account for receptor flexibility, protein-fragment interactions, and fragment desolvation penalty allowing for rapid ranking of potential ligands as blockers or nonblockers of hERG1. To illustrate the power of the approach, SILCS was applied to a test set of 55 blockers with diverse chemical scaffolds and pIC50 values measured under uniform conditions. The original SILCS model was based on the all-atom modeling of the hERG1 channel in an explicit lipid bilayer and was further augmented with a Bayesian-optimization/machine-learning (BML) stage employing an independent literature-derived training set of 163 molecules. BML approach was used to determine weighting factors for the FragMaps contributions to the scoring function. pIC50 predictions from the combined SILCS/BML approach to the 55 blockers showed a Pearson correlation (PC) coefficient of >0.535 relative to the experimental data. SILCS/BML model was shown to yield substantially improved performance as compared to commonly used rigid and flexible molecular docking methods for a well-established cohort of hERG1 blockers, where no correlation with experimental data was recorded. SILCS/BML results also suggest that a proper weighting of protonation states of common blockers present at physiological pH is essential for accurate predictions of blocker potency. The precalculated and optimized SILCS FragMaps can now be used for the rapid screening of small molecules for their cardiotoxic potential as well as for exploring alternative binding pockets in the hERG1 channel with applications to the rational design of activators.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c01065,WOS,Journal

It is very relevant when AI is dramatically reshaping hiring function in the changing scenario. Design/methodology/approach The objectives are achieved with the help of three studies involving Delphi method to explore the criteria for AI adoption decision. Followed by two multi criteria decision-making techniques, i.e. analytic hierarchy process to identify weights of the criteria and fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution to assess the extent of AI adoption in hiring. Findings The findings reveal that information security and return on investment are considered two very important criteria by human resources managers while contemplating the adoption of AI in hiring process. It was found that AI adoption will be suitable at the sourcing and initial screening stages of hiring. And the suitability of the hiring stage where AI can be applied has been found to have changed from before and after the onset of COVID-19 pandemic situation.

Results: Analysis of 26 interviews revealed five themes thought to be integral in an effective, sustainable LHS: (1) Systematic approaches and iterative, continuous learning with implementation into healthcare contributing to new best-practice care; (2) Broad stakeholder, clinician and academic engagement, with collective vision, leadership, governance and a culture of trust, transparency and co-design; (3) Skilled workforce, capability and capacity building; (4) Resources with sustained investment over time and; (5) Data access, systems and processes being integral to a sustainable LHS. Conclusions: This qualitative study provides insights into the elements of a sustainable LHS across a range of leaders in data-driven healthcare improvement. Fundamentally, an LHS requires continuous learning with implementation of new evidence back into frontline care to improve outcomes. Structure, governance, trust, culture, vision and leadership were all seen as important along with a skilled workforce and sustained investment. Processes and systems to optimise access to quality data were also seen as vital in an effective, sustainable LHS. These findings will inform a co-designed framework for implementing a sustainable LHS within the Australian healthcare and Academic Health Science Centre context. It is anticipated that application of these findings will assist to embed and accelerate the use of routine health data to continuously generate new knowledge and ongoing improvement in healthcare delivery and health outcomes.

(2022),Study on the Deep Learning Product Classification Based on the Motivation of Consumers,Communications in Computer and Information Science,Consumers; Deep learning; Motivation process framework; New Product Development; Product classification,10.1007/978-3-031-06391-6_66,"New Product Development (NPD) is actually a complex area involving strategy, management, research and development, production, marketing and decision-making, technology and the market need to be closely integrated. Due to the dynamic and competitive market environment, the compatibility of new products, that is, the consistency between a new product and the values of consumers, is a dynamic and complex system. Compatibility is related to the consumerâ€™s experience, lifestyle, religious beliefs, and prior knowledge of the product item. According to the process of product development, the first step is often to define the nature and function of the product, which is actually a process of new product positioning and classification in the process of product innovation. In general, the traditional process of product classification only focuses on the product and the market, and it is also the process that the designer deduces the product on the basis of successive generations. This method has become the bottleneck or restriction factor of raising productivity and standardizing production in the practical production which needs innovation constantly. Weâ€™ve learned that to better understand something, we need to better categorize it. In recent years, the method of artificial intelligence technology has been widely used in product classification, identification, search and other fields, which is in line with our technical requirements. And the use of machine learning to solve the classification problem in product classification has been a widespread concern of researchers, they believe that digital, intelligent and networked means to enable us to find new solutions. In this context, this paper presents a fast and effective product classification method based on deep learning technology, the deep learning-based Motivation process framework, which embeds human-based motivational thinking into machine learning. Itâ€™s a new kind of experiment. This framework consists of three parts: target customer modeling method based on deep learning technology; customer feature closed loop based on Motivation process framework; Weighted fusion partially outputs an iterative classification result that combines a consumer perspective with a producer perspective. We use the consumer information reasoning method and the weighted fusion module to test the deep learning-based Motivation process framework method on Cars. The experimental data show that this method can improve the performance of new product classification. This paper introduces the consumer motivation analysis into the traditional deep learning method for the first time, and finds that it has a strong application prospect. Based on this fact, this paper proposes a framework of classification algorithm based on deep learning technology, which integrates relevant design and human psychology methods. In order to improve the traditional classification algorithm which only inputted the customerâ€™s Past purchase traces Past purchase Library-CNN, the original PPL-CNN was optimized by Motivation process framework multi-neural network fusion to improve the overall performance of the network. Firstly, the image data of the target user is preprocessed and characterized to be transformed into feature vector. For example, Pearson product-moment Correlation Coefficient was chosen to evaluate the correlation between the interests and expectations of target consumers, thus making up for the limitations of having to enter and use data from large databases. The target consumer modeling module is then used to capture consumer interest, which is then fed to subsequent Motivation process framework modules. The target consumer modeling module uses image retrieval technology to model the target consumerâ€™s past purchase behavior, explores the relationship between the consumerâ€™s purchase history information and the new product information, and consummates the target consumerâ€™s personalized modeling. In this experiment, the image data representing the userâ€™s expectation is used to extract the feature information from the userâ€™s motivation. The image is then further feature extracted from the serialized data by the convolutional neural network, so that more dimensional information can be used for classification, and finally the output is combed and converged through the fully connected layer. According to the product characteristics of the producer, the paper proposes a multi-neural network-based feature fusion method for the classification of motive requirements. Because of the bi-directional coupling of the data features, the neural network model designed based on this method can better fit the data, on the basis of the original, a two-way fit mechanism between consumer and producer is added to better deal with this kind of problems. The experimental results show that the model based on this method can effectively extract the multi-dimensional features of User requirements, compared with other comparative models, the performance of the model takes into account the optimal ranking of consumers and producers, thus producing a more comprehensive classification result. This approach and technical framework will influence the future development of NPD.

Building upon the ideas of transformational and transactional leadership (TFL and TAL), explorative - and exploitative - learning (ERL and ETL), dynamic capabilities (DCs) and intellectual capital architecture (ICA), this paper develops a model of organizational learning. The model explains how leadership styles trigger versatile learning, and how DCs and ICA of a firm influence this process. Design/methodology/approach This paper builds upon a systematic review of the literature to develop propositions delineating the complex and poorly understood relationship between leadership styles, organizational learning and the role of DCs and ICA in this process. The paper develops multiple propositions, which together constitute an overarching framework explaining how leadership styles shape organizational learning. Findings Leadership approaches, DCs and ICA of a firm all have a differential effect on ERL and ETL. TFL and TAL promote ERL and ETL, respectively. The presence of DCs facilitates the effect of TFL in supporting ERL but negatively influences the role of TAL in ETL. The effect of ICA is discussed in terms of knowledge stocks (generalist vs specialist), social architecture (entrepreneurial vs cooperative) and organizational capital (organic vs mechanistic). The generalist knowledge facilitates TFL -> ERL, while the specialist knowledge facilitates TAL -> ETL path. Entrepreneurial architectures are suitable for TFL -> ERL, while cooperative structures promote TAL -> ETL trajectory. Finally, organic systems facilitate TFL -> ERL, while the mechanistic systems promote TAL -> ETL. Originality/value The key contribution of the paper is in developing a model furnishing profound insights into leadership approaches and organizational learning and the role of two critical factors. To the best of the author's knowledge, these aspects have not been discussed in a unified framework in the previous studies.

Extensive contact with suppliers, customers, scientific research institutions, and other subjects for boundary-spanning knowledge search, absorption, and reconfiguration is considered a critical path to enterprise sustainable innovation. Studying the process of how boundary-spanning search affects enterprise sustainable innovation  has become an urgent and valuable task. Therefore, based on an innovation search perspective, this study explored the path and mechanism of boundary-spanning search affecting enterprise sustainable innovation, revealed the intermediary effect of capability reconfiguration, and clarified the regulatory role of information technology (IT) governance. We also proposed an integrated model promoting enterprise sustainable innovation process. Using questionnaire data from manufacturing companies in China, this study empirically tested the proposed model hypothesis. The results demonstrated that all boundary-spanning searches (supply-side, demand-side, and cross-regional searches) positively and significantly impacted enterprise sustainable innovation. However, the effects of the search types varied. Capability reconfiguration played a partial intermediary role between boundary-spanning search and enterprise sustainable innovation. IT governance positively moderated the relationship between boundary-spanning search and enterprise capability reconfiguration, particularly between cross-regional search and enterprise capability reconfiguration. This study enriches our understanding of the sustainable innovation process and provides theoretical guidance for enterprises to improve their sustainable innovation performance by effectively using boundary-spanning search strategies.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pr9112092,WOS,Journal

Extremely large telescopes are overwhelmingly equipped with pyramid wavefront sensors (PyWFS) over the more widely used Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor to perform their single-conjugate adaptive optics (SCAO) mode. The PyWFS, a sensor based on Fourier filtering, has proven to be highly successful in many astronomy applications. However, this sensor exhibits non-linear behaviours that lead to a reduction of the sensitivity of the instrument when working with non-zero residual wavefronts. This so-called optical gains (OG) effect, degrades the closed-loop performance of SCAO systems and prevents accurate correction of non-common path aberrations (NCPA).Aims. In this paper, we aim to compute the OG using a fast and agile strategy to control PyWFS measurements in adaptive optics closed-loop systems.Methods. Using a novel theoretical description of PyWFS, which is based on a convolutional model, we are able to analytically predict the behaviour of the PyWFS in closed-loop operation. This model enables us to explore the impact of residual wavefront errors on particular aspects such as sensitivity and associated OG. The proposed method relies on the knowledge of the residual wavefront statistics and enables automatic estimation of the current OG. End-to-end numerical simulations are used to validate our predictions and test the relevance of our approach.Results. We demonstrate, using on non-invasive strategy, that our method provides an accurate estimation of the OG. The model itself only requires adaptive optics telemetry data to derive statistical information on atmospheric turbulence. Furthermore, we show that by only using an estimation of the current Fried parameter r(0) and the basic system-level characteristics, OGs can be estimated with an accuracy of less than 10%. Finally, we highlight the importance of OG estimation in the case of NCPA compensation. The proposed method is applied to the PyWFS.

Design/methodology/approach - The framework adopted assumed that for employees from both public and private sectors a range of factors contributes to a configurational effect. These factors-that can shift their behaviour towards being or becoming an intrapreneur-are the novelty of entrepreneurship, opportunities for permanent learning, the possibility of creating value for others and personal motivation. Findings - Four possible combinations of antecedent conditions that could lead to the expected outcome (being or becoming an entrepreneurial employee/intrapreneur) are consistent with the proposed model. Using a quantitative approach was appropriate for examining contrasting entrepreneurial intentions, specifically in identifying the profiles of the employees who might bring the company to the next level: information that could be useful to all managers. Research limitations/implications - Due to the exploratory nature of the research, with descriptive statistics, the correlations focused solely on the respondents' demographical characteristics. Further comparative analysis should be conducted, therefore, between public and private sectors and with larger numbers of respondents. Originality/value - To the best of our knowledge, the proposed study is novel as the first empirical integrative study using the fsQCA methodology to address the intrapreneurial phenomenon of employees from public and private organisations.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJEBR-05-2021-0400,WOS,Journal

Set within the context of secondary age phase education in England and Wales (11â€“16Â years old), this paper explores how teachers working within the field of design and technology education acquire new knowledge in STEM; how understanding is developed and subsequently embedded within their practice to support the creation of a diverse STEM-literate society. The purpose being to determine mechanisms by which knowledge acquisition occurs, to reconnoitre potential implications for education and learning at work, including consideration of the role which new technologies play in the development of STEM knowledge within and across contributory STEM subject disciplines. Underpinned by an interpretivist ontology, work presented here builds upon the premise that design and technology is an interdisciplinary educational construct and not viewed as being of equal status to other STEM disciplines including maths and science. Drawing upon the philosophical field of symbolic interactionism and constructivist grounded theory, work embraces an abductive methodology where participants are encouraged to relate design and technology within the context of STEM education. Emergent findings are discussed in relation to their potential to support teachersâ€™ educational development for the advancement of STEM literacy, and help secure design and technologyâ€™s place as a subject of value within a twenty-first Century curriculum.

The question of what kinds of purposeful innovation might benefit smallholders in developing countries has been raised. This issue presents and analyses the work of Innovation Platforms (IPs) established by the COS-SIS (Convergence of Sciences-Strengthening Innovation Systems) programme in nine agro-enterprise domains in West Africa, drawing on Theory Guided Process Inquiry data recorded through 2011-end 2013. Six papers synthesise individual IP experiences, complemented by a cross-case analysis of external influences on the IPs and their responses, a reflection on how well the IPs in Mali dealt with local conflicts, and an analysis of how the work of the IPs in Ghana led to changes in university curricula and in the researching practices of three leading agricultural institutes. An analysis of thirteen case studies from Kenya, Benin, and South Africa supported by the JOLISAA (Joint learning in and about Innovation Systems in African Agriculture) programme, adds further insights. Five general lessons are drawn, expressed as propositions that can be further tested against others' experiences: (i) IPs can bring about significant socio-technical and institutional changes at a range of levels, and in a wide variety of agro-enterprise domains and contexts; (ii) the IPs are not isolated from nor independent of the networks of influence in which they are embedded; thus they cannot be treated as the sole causal agents of the changes accomplished; (iii) research that tracks the IPs' work and performance provides evidence that enables the members to learn from experience and adjust activities in the light of effects; (iv) there is no blueprint for what an IP is nor a recipe for the processes by which such changes are brought about; the form, activities, and changes co-evolve with whatever is happening in the wider context; (v) field-based diagnosis of opportunity, evidence-based information-sharing and experimental exploration of pathways of change establish the legitimacy and influence of IPs.",2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/cagri/2016051,WOS,Journal

Some critical findings and contributions may not be recognized unless they are presented through a formal writing narrative. On the other hand, the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) has stipulated the engineering education outcomes as (f) an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility; (g) an ability to communicate effectively; (h) The broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global and societal context; (i) A recognition of the need for and an ability to engage in life-long learning, and (j) Knowledge of contemporary issues. These outcomes are hard to achieve in a traditional compartmentalized engineering curriculum. These intangible ABET outcomes can be better accomplished by providing writing assignments to engineering students. In our civil engineering senior design elective course, CE 4883-6883 Engineered Environmental Systems at Mississippi State University, we have incorporated various types of writing exercises such as informal writing, free writing, exploratory writing, formal writing (project report), and reflective writing to enhance student learning of the subject matter. Informal writing involved a critical review of different stormwater pollution management issues and current best management practices and a comparison of the alternatives. Free writing was given in class to promote free thinking and thinking through writing. Exploratory writing exercise involved a topical discussion of stormwater treatment process. A formal writing exercise was given in the form of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) assignment which included a peer-review session prior to final grading. A reflective writing exercise was included to summarize learning experiences through classroom and writing activities throughout the semester to identify areas of strengths and weaknesses and accomplishments and pitfalls and areas/topics for future development. Student learning experiences and the effectiveness of writing exercises were discussed. The benefits of writing exercises were evaluated through the ABET outcomes and a survey and evaluation of students' performance throughout the semester. Results from this preliminary study suggested the need for more structured writing assignments and detailed analysis and assessment/evaluation process for identifying the effectiveness of writing exercises for developing critical thinking skills and for achieving ABET outcomes.

There is much research and development investigating this area, with a wide variety of proposed explanation techniques for AI/ML across a variety of data modalities. In this paper we investigate which modality of explanation to choose for a particular user and task, taking into account relevant contextual information such as the time available to them, their level of skill, what level of access they have to the data and sensors in question, and the device that they are using. Additional environmental factors such as available bandwidth, currently usable sensors and services are also able to be accounted for. The explanation techniques that we are investigating range across transparent and post-hoc mechanisms and form part of a conversation with the user in which the explanation (and therefore human understanding of the AI decision) can be ascertained through dialogue with the system. Our research is exploring generic techniques that can be used to underpin useful explanations in a range of modalities in the context of AI/ML services that operate on multisensor data in a distributed, dynamic, contested and adversarial setting. We define a meta-model for representing this information and through a series of examples show how this approach can be used to support conversational explanation across a range of situations, datasets and modalities.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2520282,WOS,Conference Paper

This study provides a theoretical framework and empirical validation for how an NPD team manages knowledge resources and strategic orientation to enhance its knowledge management capabilities, which, in turn, lead to business-to-busienss (B-to-B) new product advantages. Methodology/approach: A total of 100 sets of data was collected from B-to-B firms in U.S. high-tech industries. In order to validate the proposed hypotheses, we estimated the main effects using path analysis in AMOS, and tested for interaction effects using interaction term regressions. Findings: Our findings show that the two dimensions of NPD knowledge management capabilitiesâ€”acquisition and applicationâ€”are important but differential drivers of product quality superiority and product differentiation. In testing whether NPD management capabilities matter for two product advantage constructs, we confirmed that product quality superiority can be enhanced by both NPD knowledge acquisition and application capabilities, whereas product differentiation can be increased strongly by NPD knowledge acquisition capabilities. Research implications: Our research confirms the importance of strategic orientation as a driver of NPD knowledge management capabilities, which enhances understanding of how strategic factors operate under a resource-based view. Our results further provide direct empirical support for the knowledge-based view of firms, in that an NPD teamâ€™s abilities to manage and deploy knowledge-based resources by acquiring and applying NPD knowledge lead to competitive advantages, for outcomes of quality superiority and differentiation. Practical implications: Our findings have relevance for managers in three ways. First, NPD knowledge acquisition and application capabilities have differential impacts on product quality superiority and differentiation. Second, in exploring NPD resource factors as antecedents, managers should manage levels of NPD market intelligence, resource tacitness, and NPD resource deployment differentially to directly improve NPD teamsâ€™ acquisition and application capabilities. Third, managers should not underestimate the importance of market and technological orientations in enhancing NPD knowledge management capabilities. Market orientation drives both NPD knowledge acquisition and application capabilities; technological orientation drives NPD knowledge application capabilities. Originality/value/contribution of the paper: An NPD teamâ€™s knowledge management capabilities generally, but differentially, mediate the relationships of knowledge resources and strategic orientation factors with new product competitive advantage. However, simply enhancing NPD knowledge management capabilities is not a panacea for developing product competitive advantage in B-to-B settings, because of their differential effects.

Defined as energy transition, such change involves at least two dimensions: one technological and one social. Especially the latter is gaining importance because it is argued that the impact of technological innovation could be limited, if not harmful, if the technological would not be matched with social innovation. This refers to the emergence of decentralized energy systems at the local scale, and the increased involvement of non-state actors in shaping the transition, like civil society, business, and local public authorities. It includes new forms of governance, ranging from energy communities to the design of urban living labs. This work aims to provide the first insights for the further development of a theoretical framework in relation to governance and social innovation in the context of energy transition. It builds on a bibliometric quantitative analysis to explore the extent to which changes in energy governance are reflected in the scientific literature. Results indicate that energy governance issues have quite settled in the scientific literature across the world, but that social innovation is only a recently emerging topic. A snapshot interpretive analysis is then performed to get a better understanding of what types of energy governance and social innovations are addressed. These mostly refer to energy communities and organization types related to the use of renewable energies (e.g., cooperatives and publicâ€“private partnerships), as well as obstacles and opportunities that drive their implementation. A keyword analysis is used to get the first indications on the direction of the discussion. Generally, this seems rather heterogeneous, though most often it is related to urban development and cities, as well as in relation to the planning practice. Future research should extend and carry out further in-depth analysis of the preliminary insights outlined in this work.

Following the logic of Ajzen's theory of planned behavior (TPB) and incorporating organizational learning culture (OLC), this study reveals the formation mechanisms underlying SMCEs' ICT adoption behavior. The behavioral model was empirically tested through a hierarchical regression analysis of 177 questionnaires completed by top managers of SMCEs in China. The results indicated that mimetic pressure (MP), strategic value judgment (SVJ), and behavioral control capability (BCC) can drive adoption behavior directly. Although normative pressure (NP) and efficiency value judgment (EVJ) do not exert direct effects on adoption behavior, their indirect effects on adoption behavior are fully mediated by adoption intention. The impact of coercive pressure (CP) on adoption intention and adoption behavior was not supported. In addition, OLC was found to be a positive moderator for the relationship between adoption intention and adoption behavior. This study extends the explanatory context of TPB and provides the feasibility for the industry to guide SMCEs to adopt ICT from multiple paths of intention and behavior.

(2021),The Emergence of Artificial Intelligence within Radiation Oncology Treatment Planning,ONCOLOGY,,10.1159/000512172,"Background: The future of artificial intelligence (AI) heralds unprecedented change for the field of radiation oncology. Commercial vendors and academic institutions have created AI tools for radiation oncology, but such tools have not yet been widely adopted into clinical practice. In addition, numerous discussions have prompted careful thoughts about AI's impact upon the future landscape of radiation oncology: How can we preserve innovation, creativity, and patient safety? When will AI-based tools be widely adopted into the clinic? Will the need for clinical staff be reduced? How will these devices and tools be developed and regulated? Summary: In this work, we examine how deep learning, a rapidly emerging subset of AI, fits into the broader historical context of advancements made in radiation oncology and medical physics. In addition, we examine a representative set of deep learning-based tools that are being made available for use in external beam radiotherapy treatment planning and how these deep learning-based tools and other AI-based tools will impact members of the radiation treatment planning team. Key Messages: Compared to past transformative innovations explored in this article, such as the Monte Carlo method or intensity-modulated radiotherapy, the development and adoption of deep learning-based tools is occurring at faster rates and promises to transform practices of the radiation treatment planning team. However, accessibility to these tools will be determined by each clinic's access to the internet, web-based solutions, or high-performance computing hardware. As seen by the trends exhibited by many technologies, high dependence on new technology can result in harm should the product fail in an unexpected manner, be misused by the operator, or if the mitigation to an expected failure is not adequate. Thus, the need for developers and researchers to rigorously validate deep learning-based tools, for users to understand how to operate tools appropriately, and for professional bodies to develop guidelines for their use and maintenance is essential. Given that members of the radiation treatment planning team perform many tasks that are automatable, the use of deep learning-based tools, in combination with other automated treatment planning tools, may refocus tasks performed by the treatment planning team and may potentially reduce resource-related burdens for clinics with limited resources.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000512172,WOS,Journal

The modern entrepreneurial approach is, therefore, more and more focused on the identification and actualization of new opportunities, like emerging on the international scene, rather than being based on a rational combination of know-how and of marketing expectations. Nowadays, the phenomena of internationalization affects every type of organization: private and public, for-profit and nonprofit, and large and small. As a consequence of the above, international entrepreneurship (IE) has recently emerged as a research field and this article aims at exploring some its implications. IE may be considered a set of new and innovative activities aiming at the creation of value and growth beyond national borders, by the combination of innovative, proactive, and risk-seeking behaviors that crosses national borders. In this context, we focus on a specific case: knowledge-based firms. In order to achieve this scope, after a preliminary section delineating the research field, we have developed our study in a number of steps that approach the research topic. Firstly, we explore and summarize the literature about research on the emerging area of international entrepreneurship. Then, we present the accumulated knowledge stemming from the relationship between knowledge and internationalization, looking at the phenomena of international start-ups. After this, we explore international entrepreneurship by academic context, identifying the main factors that influence the choice of the market on the part of the knowledge-based firms. Lastly, we characterize knowledge-based entrepreneurship as a virtuous combination of knowledge and entrepreneurship. Finally, we draw conclusions identifying the factors able to boost capacities for such expansion of firms originating from innovation and that have operations suited to a widely ultra-national context.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13132-016-0352-1,WOS,Journal

However, none have been highly satisfying in lessening the impact of disasters. The significant factor for the limited success of modern scientific society is that it views the world from a temporal perspective where humans are believed to be an active agent in modifying every natural possibility into opportunity. The very composite environmental system is simplified whilst extracting resources, resulting in resource depletion and environmental degradation, consequently opening the door for disaster. Technocratic science must recognise the need for a relational or holistic approach rather than believing in reductionist approaches alone whilst dealing with natural calamities. In this context, the knowledge of traditional societies is important to fill up the existing gaps created by the modern society. Traditional knowledge has different sets of ingredients to foster the development of the relational or holistic approach as it involves, interacts and interconnects humans, non-humans (animals and plants) and nature together, setting a perfect balance for sustainable development and DRR. It has vast undocumented observational data of changing natural phenomena, and in today's scenario of climate change and uncertainty, it can create a path for reliable adaptation measures from climate-induced disasters. Thus, a holistic approach is needed for comprehensive DRR measures where both scientific and traditional knowledge systems can work together. The main purpose of this article was to explore the effective ingredients of traditional knowledge in DRR and how this age-old wisdom can be offered a hand to its integration into and collaboration with scientific research and management for DRR. To fulfil the objectives, a theoretical desk study approach was followed by identifying relevant studies, highlighting traditional knowledge in DRR from empirical and grey literatures, archive materials, biblical stories and so on. This research highlights some of the good practices of traditional knowledge in DRR and the possible path of collaboration of two knowledge systems in DRR.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.4102/jamba.v11i1.484,WOS,Journal

Through the use of structural equation modeling and hierarchical regression analyses, we tested the conceptual model with a data set of 298 small- and medium-sized enterprises in China. The results demonstrate that the positive influence of community CSR on service innovation performance is partially mediated by dynamic capability, whereas this effect of environmental CSR is fully mediated by dynamic capability.

First, to understand recombinant innovation (RI) as a potentially significant part of an open innovation (OI) strategy and second, to suggest key routines which would underpin a capability for RI, locating these within the context of enhanced absorptive capacity (AC). Finally, the paper considers how such routines could be developed, drawing on some case examples.

The authors then explore one OI route - RI - and suggest a model framework for operationalizing it based on routines for search, acquisition, assimilation and deployment. Findings - The authors suggest three sets of routines required for RI, around abstract-driven search (ADS), brokerage and cyclic adaptation. As with much of the now widely available toolkit for OI, the challenge is one of moving from potential to realized opportunity and this will require investments in learning and capability building.

Though the advantages of digital supply chain management (DSCM) are many, its implementation is quite slow for several reasons. The purpose of this paper is to identify the major barriers which hinder the adoption of DSC and to analyse the interrelationship among them. The barriers of DSC are explored on the basis of existing literature and expertsâ€™ opinion. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses the interpretive structural modelling (ISM) approach to develop a hierarchical structural model which shows the mutual dependence among the barriers of DSC. Cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification analysis was performed to represent these barriers graphically on the basis of their driving power and dependence. Findings: The research demonstrates that the barriers â€œno sense of urgencyâ€, â€œlack of industry specific guidelinesâ€, â€œlack of digital skills and talentâ€ and â€œhigh implementation and running costâ€ are the most significant barriers to digital transformation of supply chain. This paper also suggests some managerial implications to overcome the barriers which hinder the implementation of digital transformation of supply chain. Practical implications: This paper assists managers and policymakers to understand the order in which these barriers must be tackled and adopts a roadmap for successful implementation of DSCM and reap its benefits. Originality/value: This is one of the initial research studies which has analysed the barriers of DSC using ISM approach.

Education seems to have a significant role in the safeguarding of ICH and UNESCO itself clearly highlights its value, nonetheless, looking at specific cultural expressions, it is difficult (often impossible in the case of rare ICHs) to find formal and structured training initiatives, being them online or face-to-face. This is due to the intrinsic nature of these expressions (that are alive and not stable) and to the traditional methods typically adopted for their transmission, which are usually based on imitation and apprenticeship. In this paper we describe how, in order to maximize the educational opportunities and involve a wider public, the i-Treasures project [2] tried to go beyond the current practice, by conceiving more structured and standardized training initiatives mediated by the technology. To do so, a new methodology for ICH education is proposed, based on the idea that, in order to master any specific cultural expression, a learner needs to get through three main essential stages: (1) s/he needs to acquire a background of knowledge on the cultural expression (2) s/he needs to observe and explore experts' performance in order to become able to appreciate/detect the main features of the ICH itself, (3) s/he needs to practice, getting feedback in such a way to understand her/his mistakes and improve the quality of the performance. The proposed methodology can be implemented either in formal or non-formal learning contexts and it can be applied in technology enhanced learning initiatives, as well as within face-to-face scenarios. Furthermore, within the i-Treasures project, an ad hoc tool, called Pedagogical Planner [3], has been developed, aimed to support the design process (by teachers and ICH experts) of learning paths based the methodology itself [4]. The tool allows the creators to conceptualize the design at macro-level and then to author the sequence of activities to be proposed to learners. The resulting paths can also be automatically transformed into courses on a Learning Management System (LMS) [5]. A particular case study (concerning the Italian cultural expression called Canto a Tenore) is used as an example of application of both the methodology and the tool.",2016,,WOS,Conference Paper

We employ fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), a method that accommodates mutual causality, discontinuity and equifinality, to analyze survey data from a sample of U.S. IT managers. The analysis reveals six different configurations that produce high digital innovation performance.

The innovative capability of organizations depends undoubtedly on how successful they are in the generation of knowledge, either via external acquisition or internal creation, and how organizational culture, management support and human capital factors are significant. Design/methodology/approach: To validate this phenomenon, a quantitative explanatory study was designed. Data collection was carried out through a questionnaire completed by 211 respondent of firms located in Mexico. During data analysis, structural equation modeling was implemented with the support of SmartPLS 3.0 to understand the moderating role of organizational factors and human capital between knowledge support system and innovativeness. Findings: The findings show that it is fundamental to build theories grounded in the particular realities of Latin American countries. For instance, these results suggest that there are two paths of innovation in Mexico in which organizational and human factors play key but differentiated roles. On the one hand, organizational culture, top management support, commitment and openness to innovation are essential to building and maintaining a knowledge support system that enables innovation. Additionally, promoting people-oriented organizations is key to innovation. Human capital factors, such as collaborators' motivation, professional skills and the opportunity to learn, intensify the knowledge support system and innovative capability. Research limitations/implications: The main limitations of the study are that only Mexican firms have been analyzed, and it is not possible to generalize the results to other contexts. Additionally, we have not identified whether the organizations that participated in the study originated in Mexico or are global enterprises that operate in Mexico. It could be significant to analyze whether multinationals from other countries that are operating in Mexico are more committed to learning to innovate than Mexican firms and the differences in their knowledge generation activities. Practical implications: The results of this study invite: (1) Managers to develop strategic initiatives that systematically promote knowledge generation activities identifying external and internal activities that allow them to build and maintain a knowledge support system, (2) Organizations to promote collaborative spaces in which employees can work in teams and strengthen their social ties, identifying communication physical and virtual spaces to share new ideas, seek new ways of doing things, and explore new processes and activities. This process will be significant in a culture where resistance to change predefines how knowledge translates into innovation. Social implications: The improvement of collaborators skills must be accompanied by other policies to enhance the innovation and business environment including the modernization and expansion of infrastructure. It is fundamental that governments firms and universities jointly develop a research agenda that will lead to the identification of significant issues and the effectiveness of solutions to foster innovation in Mexico. Only a holistic approach is likely to help the country move up the value chain and become a knowledge economy. In fact innovation is seen as a social process of public sector organizations that promote knowledge infrastructure such as universities and the government agencies that produce knowledge. Originality/value: These results suggest that there are two paths of innovation in Mexico in which organizational and human factors play a key but differentiated role. In Mexican firms, innovative capability is possible due to knowledge support systems built on organizational factors, and human capital factors, such as professional skills and motivation for opportunities to learn which intensify innovation.

As means of validating this research model, a real-life design project has been chosen to illustrate the practical application of this approach. Feedback and observations from a short end-user questionnaire assessed qualitatively the facade patterning and panelization approach. Findings: The proposed merge (or overlay) of AID images can be used as a parametric thinking method rather than just theory to generate and articulate dynamic facade design. The facade panelization responds to an AID that resembles design-performance data (e.g. solar exposure, interior privacy importance and aesthetics). Originality/value: This work identifies a form of parametric thinking defined as the expression of geometrical relationships and its configuration dependent on the AID pixel Red Green Blue color source values. In this type of thinking, it explores the impact of the digital process and parametric thinking utility when driven by an AID overlay. The framework highlighted the practical application of AID pixel approach within a digital process to benefit both designers and computational tools developer on emerging design innovations.

The field of sustainability transitions seeks systematic solutions for fundamental transformations of socio-technical systems towards sustainability, and exploring the role of policy mixes has been a central research agenda within the field. In the extant literature, there exists a lack of both conceptual and empirical research on the vertical dimension of policy mixes for sustainability transitions. This study provides a multilevel and evolutionary interpretation of the vertical interactions of policy mixes in the process of industrial path development towards sustainability transitions. An exemplary case of solar water heating (SWH) technology in Shandong Province in China is presented, capturing both the bottom-up and top-down processes of interactions. On the one hand, urban-level policy initiatives can inform higher-level policymaking; on the other hand, national-level priorities can greatly configure policy strategies for lower-level governments. Moreover, as the industry matures, the interactions of multilevel policy mixes evolve from simpler, unidirectional patterns to more complex, bidirectional ones through a vertical policy-learning feedback mechanism. This study generates two important policy implications that extend beyond the Chinese context: first, dynamic vertical interactions between multilevel governments indicate the need to develop more nuanced perspectives on the design of policy mixes; second, policy makers need to hold a more dynamic view of policy mixes by recognizing their temporal and coevolutionary nature through the policy learning process.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2019.02.009,WOS,Journal

This paper aims to theorize and examine how central cognition elaboration cue and peripheral cognition elaboration cue impact usersâ€™ continuance intention of mobile health applications in the context of the developing markets. Design/methodology/approach: Applying the elaboration likelihood model as the basic theoretical framework, this paper proposed the hypotheses and research model to explore the internal formation mechanism of usersâ€™ continuance intention of mobile health applications. And the moderating effect of privacy concern was especially studied under the context of the developing market. The empirical investigation (N = 284) collects research data through questionnaire by selecting a certain mobile health application from Chinese markets. Findings: The results show that, both perceived usefulness and trust positively affect usersâ€™ continuance intention. For central route, doctor's service quality and doctor's information quality positively influence perceived usefulness. For peripheral route, app's reputation and app's institution assurance significantly promote usersâ€™ trust. What's more, for the moderating effect, privacy concern can enhance the impact of perceived usefulness on continuance intention and strengthen the effect of trust on continuance intention to a great extent. Originality/value: This paper is one of the first studies to focus on usersâ€™ continuance intention of mobile health apps with the moderating effect of privacy concern in the developing markets. It is valuable to develop the study from the perspective of process-oriented to persuasion to explore usersâ€™ behavioral intention.

Unfortunately, a lack of clarity exists in the conceptualization of adaptive cultures and little empirical research investigates its impact on survival. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was twofold: (1) to identify, define, and develop a measure of adaptive organizational culture and (2) to demonstrate the effect of adaptive culture on organizational survival. Design/Methodology/Approach An adaptive culture rating scale was developed based on a review of the existing literature. Ninety-five organizations founded prior to 1940 were rated on nine characteristics of adaptive culture. Ratings were used to predict likelihood to survive using a Cox regression with proportional hazards survival analysis. Findings Exploratory factor analysis revealed two broad factors of adaptive culture, values toward change and action-orientation. Findings indicate organizations with adaptive cultures were more likely to survive. Implications The present effort provided evidence that culture can serve as an adaptive mechanism with effects spanning decades. Leaders should focus on establishing adaptive cultural norms and values in order to increase chances of surviving. Originality/Value This is one of the first historiometric studies to develop and utilize a measure of adaptive culture. Further, this study looked at the impact of adaptive culture on long-term organizational outcomes using survival analysis, a statistical technique not often employed in the organizational literature.",2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10869-015-9420-y,WOS,Journal

However, the learning of compulsory waste sorting by non-local festival attendees in a semi-free choice festival context and the roles of the relevant factors require further investigation. In particular, for the non-local attendees, the festival context avails both the opportunity and occasion for effective learning of compulsory waste sorting, a unique research window worth further exploration. Employing a systematic modeling approach to comprehensively investigate the interrelationships among the identified significant factors, this study explores and examines the mechanism of this learning process with a hierarchy of positive relationships between the host communications, learning outcomes and behavioral intentions of the festival attendees concerning compulsory waste sorting. The research subject of this study was a branded forest music festival held in a waste-sorting pilot city in East China, which has long been pivoting to the promotion of environmental-friendly values. The objective measurement of the learning outcomes integrated by this study accentuate the effectiveness of the proposed structural model. Our research findings confirmed all of the hypothesized relationships and established positive learning outcomes for the festival attendees on waste sorting as instructed by the festival hosts.

OC has been regarded as the most lethal cancer among women all around the world. There are at least five main types of OCs classified by the fifth edition of the World Health Organization of tumors: high-/low-grade serous carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, and endometrioid carcinoma. With the improved knowledge of genome-wide association study (GWAS) and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses, the knowledge of genomic landscape of complex diseases has been uncovered in large measure. Moreover, pathway analyses also play an important role in exploring the underlying mechanism of complex diseases by providing curated pathway models and information about molecular dynamics and cellular processes. To investigate OCs deeper, we introduced a novel disease susceptible gene prediction method, XGBG, which could be used in identifying OC-related genes based on different omics data and deep learning methods. We first employed the graph convolutional network (GCN) to reconstruct the gene features based on both gene feature and network topological structure. Then, a boosting method is utilized to predict OC susceptible genes. As a result, our model achieved a high AUC of 0.7541 and an AUPR of 0.8051, which indicates the effectiveness of the XGPG. Based on the newly predicted OC susceptible genes, we gathered and researched related literatures to provide strong support to the results, which may help in understanding the pathogenesis and mechanisms of the disease.

It proposes a new approach to reconnect the contingency factors to the optimization of productivity. This helps us to identify the changing characteristics that influence the determinants of decisions, actions and management of the technological projects of the mainly innovative enterprises. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses techniques that effectively solve unobserved endogeneity and heterogeneity problems in enterprises: an empiricalâ€“structural design. With this method, this study enables rich empirical conceptualization and helps with extending theory. However, there is a need to further the research by taking into account the system analysis and the complexity of the research object: one of the options might be to explore a possible follow-up of the research through drawing on ethnostatistics and qualimetrics. Findings: The analysis reveals that the phenomenon of technological project productivity in operational governance context is thus manifested by the coexistence of the applied governance configuration variables, the contingency factors operationalization, the optimizing productivity mechanisms and this with the secular innovation and stagnation and stagnation. Ceteris paribus, the governance operationalizations have an important role in the productivity of technological projects of the innovative enterprises. Originality/value: This research is the first to mobilize as major determinants of the operationalization of governance, the oversight of the capital, the dividend strategy and the system control, the managerial follow-up, the detection of opportunistic behaviours and the application of governing incentives (among others) as governance configuration variables in order to highlight their interactions with productivity in the innovative firm technological projects.

Since previous studies have mostly explored the relationship between the two from the perspective of technological innovation, the endogeneity problem makes the research results lack credibility. This study attempts to fill this gap. Constructing a quasi-natural experiment based on the national innovative city policy, this study explores the impact and mechanism of innovation-driven development on pollution reduction using propensity score matching(PSM) and difference-in-differences(DID) models. The results demonstrate that the construction of national innovative cities has a positive effect on the reduction of pollution emissions intensity, which is mainly achieved through the improvement of urban innovation level and industrial R&D personnel concentration but has not effectively promoted pollution reduction through the advanced industrial structure. Additionally, national innovative city policy exhibits heterogeneous effects on pollution reduction. Specifically, the pollution reduction effect of big cities is weaker than that of small and medium-sized cities. The greater the manufacturing scale and the degree of financial support for science and technology, the stronger the pollution reduction effects. The pollution reduction effect shows a non-linear mechanism as pollution emissions intensity increases, and the overall trend is upward. Accordingly, corresponding policy recommendations are put forward based on the current weakness.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2021.121047,WOS,Journal

Yet, although previous scholarship has explored a number of antecedents of BIM adoption, little is known about factors influencing such a burgeoning phenomenon-BIM integration. Against this background, this study employs knowledge coupling theory to investigate antecedents of BIM integration intention (BII). This study surveys 167 managers in the Chinese construction industry and analyzes the data using the structural equation modeling technique. The results indicate that three types of knowledge inertia (i.e., routine problem-solving strategy) exert different effects on BII. Specifically, experience inertia positively affects BII, learning inertia negatively affects BII, and procedural inertia has no effect on BII. Moreover, both formal and informal knowledge governance are positively related to BII. Further, formal knowledge governance is found to weaken the negative link between learning inertia and BII but strengthen the positive link between experience inertia and BII. These findings contribute to the construction management literature by deepening our understanding of BIM integration. Implications on BIM integration for practitioners are also discussed.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0001018,WOS,Journal

(2022),Lubricant or Stumbling Block?: The Paradoxical Association Between Team Authoritarian Leadership and Creative Deviance,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,,10.3389/fpsyg.2022.835970,"Recently, creative deviance has been lauded to be an innovation-enhancing approach with applications in many new and high-tech domains. Previous study on antecedents to creative deviance remains scattered and vague. Our research conceptualizes creative deviance from the perspective of independent innovation and explores its antecedents, mechanisms, as well as conditions. Team authoritarian leadership is conceptualized as a contradictory unity as it mixes advantages and disadvantages. However, it is surprising to find that there are very few researches that have examined its relevant influence mechanisms and boundary conditions for authoritarian leadership. Contributing to an advanced understanding of authoritarian leadership in research and development teams, we investigated whether team authoritarian leadership is positively or negatively related to creative deviance. Drawing on social information processing theory and regulatory focus theory, we supposed that team authoritarian leadership facilitates creative deviance when the degree is low and inhibits it when the degree is high; dual occupational stress and prevention regulatory focus play mediation roles between team authoritarian leadership and creative deviance respectively, both variables play a chain mediation role in that relationship; and the mindfulness characteristic of an individual moderates the inverted-U team authoritarian leadership-creative deviance association, such that this association is weaker with low individual mindfulness. With two-phase questionnaire data collected from 433 members in 82 R&D teams of high-tech enterprises in electronic information technology, new material technology, new medical technology, resource and environment technology and advanced manufacturing technology randomly selected from five provinces in eastern China, these hypotheses are supported empirically. Overall, we find that, our study broadens antecedents and the relevant occurrence mechanisms of creative deviance when studied through a leadership management lens. Moreover, our research enriches the cognate studies on authoritarian leadership by empirically demonstrating that team authoritarian leadership may function as an double-edged sword of creative deviance in the R&D workplace. These above findings offer insightful thoughts to scholars in the field of authoritarian leadership and bring practical suggestions for team superiors who seek to implement best innovation practice.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.835970,WOS,Journal

To lower the PM talent deficit and mitigate the higher project failure rates, academic institutions have been developing PM curriculums aimed at inculcating a repertoire of competencies to the potential project managers. In developing an ideal well-rounded PM curriculum, academic institutions occasionally engage the input of industry partners and governing entities. The study aims to (1) compare the competencies in one of the leading industry competency model and framework (PMI Talent Triangle) to the competencies in the PM course syllabi learning outcomes, (2) determine the extent to which these two sets of PM competencies are aligned and (3) and explore avenues for improvements. Design/methodology/approach - The study uses a purposeful sampling method to gather PM course syllabi. The PM competencies data are gleaned from the syllabi using the content analysis method. Thereafter, QSR NVivo qualitative statistical software is used to summarize and analyze the competency data from the learning outcomes. Findings - The results reveal that most of the PM competencies in the course syllabi fall under the technical PM domain. Specifically, the top three competency elements in each domain are technical PM domain (PM skills, tools and techniques, schedule management and cost estimation/budget), leadership domain (team building, verbal/written communication and problem-solving) and strategic and business management domain (strategic planning, analysis and alignment, benefits management and realization, customer relationship and satisfaction). Research limitations/implications - The study investigates the alignment of the PM course competencies with competency domains in the PMI Talent Triangle, a global competence model that is well aligned with other global competence models such as the APM Competence Framework, the ICB4 Individual Competence Baseline and the PROMA3. Practical implications - The results from this study provide guidelines useful in informing PM curricula re/design, as well as the inculcation of knowledge, skills, tools, techniques and behaviors needed for effective PM. Social implications - The PM curriculum can be improved by partnering with PM industry leaders who can serve as advisors to the academy on industry needs, direction and emerging innovations that can inform PM learning outcomes, PM curricular design and the development of quality PM talent. The academy and the industry are encouraged to actively strive for mutual partnerships where PM professionals and academicians serve on each other's advisory boards. Also, the academy can partner with the industry professionals by developing curriculum resources such as case studies that bring the real-life PM applications to the classroom. Originality/value - This study is motivated by the call for research studies that provide a holistic picture of the desired PM competencies and an exploration and definition of the educational needs in the PM curriculum.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JEAS-12-2020-0200,WOS,Journal

In this study, the work conditions for employees from Taiwan, Malaysia, and the Chinese mainland are explored and compared, and the relationship between support mechanisms and innovation behaviors (IB) is evaluated with a view of the social cognitive career theory. This study adopts the cross-sectional survey and purposive sampling to collect questionnaires. A total of 623 copies of a questionnaire from Taiwanese, 440 copies from Malaysians, and 513 copies from mainlanders were collected in this study to compare the three groups in developing employeesâ€™ IBs. Smart-partial least squares for partial least squares structural equation modeling was applied in the structural model to conduct a verification of the hypotheses and comparative analysis in this study. According to the findings, compared with employees from the Chinese mainland, the Taiwanese and Malaysian samples show more significant paths regarding employee employability, IB, prior knowledge, perceived organizational support, self-efficacy, and job performance.

The increasing number of research articles in SFSC justifies this. With 80% of publications in SFSC coming up in the last 7 years, this field is expanding and diversifying at a rapid rate. The research on sustainable food supply chain (SFSC) covers a wide variety of areas and has a wide range of research themes in FSC. To facilitate the theoretical understanding of SFSC, we have conducted a review of the literature on SFSC. With the aim to define prominent research themes in SFSC, we follow an integrated review approach of structured literature review (SLR), bibliometric analysis, and thematic analysis. Bibliometric analysis was conducted using the vosviewer software version 1.6.16. The thematic analysis identified- â€œWaste managementâ€, â€œSC sustainability and impact assessmentâ€, â€œDecision supportâ€, â€œOperations management and optimizationâ€, â€œFood quality and safetyâ€, â€œSustainable business modelsâ€, â€œInnovation and technological solutionâ€, â€œSC strategyâ€, and â€œSocial sustainabilityâ€ as the key emergent themes. We discuss the conceptual and theoretical basis of each of these themes. â€œSC sustainability and impact assessmentâ€ is identified as the most dominant theme in SFSC. Innovation and technological solution is an emerging theme with many new publications related to disruptive technologies coming up. Research in collaboration and decision theory-based approaches is important to enable sustainability in FSC. Quantifying waste streams, identifying hotspots are important future directions of research in SFSCM. Circular economy, AFSC, and the use of advanced technologies to enable circularity and sustainability also have great scope. The review aims to help researchers and academicians understand the boundaries and domain of SFSC and the future scope of these themes about how they can enhance the sustainability in SFSC.

Design/methodology/approach This research is from the qualitative point of view and in terms of the purpose of application-development that has been done in the second part. At the first step, Iran's (IRI) national comprehensive policies have been studied from 1993 to 2020; out of 52 documents, 7 were relevant, of which 38 policies were eventually selected. Then, policy statements were explored, and open coding and categorization has been done through theme analysis approach to attain fundamental themes and organizational themes. In the second step, the themes were extracted in the form of soft research method with the approach of interpretive structural modeling to level the financing policies of technological entrepreneurship in Iran. Findings The results show that the most important factors influencing financing and entrepreneurship in Iran are increasing the productivity of goods and services, supporting entrepreneurship, increasing the efficiency of monetary policies that are in the first level. Research limitations/implications Research limitations include access to upstream documents, strategies, administrative and organizational coordination to study documents. Practical implications These findings are very important to scholars, the policymakers and technological entrepreneurship operators in designing their financing strategies.

It uses patent data collected between 2010 and 2018 to systematically examine and visualize promising knowledge interactions that could foster the advancement of solid-state battery technology. Moreover, solid-state battery technology is compared with lithium-ion battery technology to demonstrate the difference in development focus. Based on different metrics and methodological designs, the results indicate that solid-state batteries are an emerging field driven by the uptake of electric vehicles. The results also reveal that a critical factor for desirable cell performance in lithium-based solid-state batteries is improvement to electrode-electrolyte interface stability, while the most critical factor for lithium-ion batteries is electrode materials. Additionally, materials, advanced manufacturing, battery engineering and automotive sectors must work together to establish a dominant design and corresponding value chain. Moreover, like with lithium-ion batteries, Asian manufacturers are dominating the patent space. The proposed framework is expected to add a new empirical perspective to the discussion of sustainable technology development and provide insight on innovation areas where key players can coordinate their activities to ramp up R&D operations.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.131689,WOS,Journal

In BA studies the students who take part in team learning have specialized in marketing since 2009 at the Saimaa University of Applied Sciences (SUAS). The model called ICT entrepreneurship study path (ICT-ESP) has been developed for IT education. The ICT-ESP has been built on the theory of experiental learning and theories of knowledge creation and knowledge management. The students study and complete their degree as team entrepreneurs. The model has been further developed in the Business Administration Degree Programme with students who specialize in marketing. The Degree Programme in IT at the Bachelor's level was terminated in 2011 by Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture. Currently, there are severe discussions on bringing it back - not as an IT but as an ICT Degree Programme. This article makes a cross-section of what has already been explored with the team learning and team entrepreneurship model and what the next steps will be. It makes a comparison of two originally separately developed models and discusses their best practices. The article also argues whether the upcoming ICT education should be organized in a conventional way - as curriculum of courses, or as expansion of the current team learning and team entrepreneurship model. The data consists of field notes, meeting memos, and dozens of unofficial discussions with colleagues and company representatives. Literature studies made during the ongoing research, development, and innovation (RDI) projects offered an extra view of how the business context is changing and what should be done to make benefit out of the change. The results suggest that the upcoming ICT Degree Programme at SUAS should be integrated into the existing deployment of team learning and team entrepreneurship learning environment. This would foster collaboration between different disciplines, e.g. marketing and ICT. Furthermore, the emerging ideation, service design and experimentation ecosystem which we are developing in ongoing RDI projects, would be strengthened by adding more students focused on ICT competencies into it. The article was later extended to include interview data from 12 themebased specialist interviews where the thoughts of original article were tested among administration of our campus, RDI funder, experienced and former team entrepreneurs, and local entrepreneurs. The results validated the author's previous suggestions of how future ICT education should be organized and also provided some new targets for development. The essential findings were: The future ICT education should be deployed in a way that it a) develops students' entrepreneurial mindset b) offers versatile cooperation possibilities with existing marketing team entrepreneurs and other enterprises, and c) the current ecosystem should be internationalized.",2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.3991/ijep.v7i1.6517,WOS,Journal

On the basis of elaborating the mechanism of ER on technological innovation, the Super-SBM-Windows-DEA model is employed to measure the green innovation efficiency (GIE) using provincial-level panel data from 2004-2017 in China. The system generalised method of moments is used to estimate the direct effects of ER on GIE, an innovative mediating effect model that based on structural equation model is utilised to explore their indirect effects. Further, a spatial econometric model is developed to examine the possible spatial effects between ER and GIE. The 'U' shaped relationship between ER and GIE is verified in the direct effect test. The results of the indirect effects indicate that ER is not conducive to GIE by discouraging the inflows and outflows of FDI, while it contributes to GIE by promoting the structural upgrading of industry. The spatial effect results show that the impact of ER on GIE in neighbouring areas has an obvious spatial spillover characteristic, which is manifested as an inverted 'U'-shaped relationship of promotion followed by inhibition. The paper further proposes policy implications including strengthening cross-regional joint prevention and control, integrating ER strategies, and rational application of ER tools, so as to promote a win-win development of innovation and sustainability, and the positive effects of ER are better developed.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sd.2336,WOS,Journal

In a VLC, users are not only the extractors of knowledge results but also the source of the platform knowledge base. The continuous knowledge sharing and communication of VLC users promote the sustainable development of the community. Studying the continuous use behavior of users in the VLC for the sustainable development of the community is of great importance. This study introduces the perceptual normativeness, perceptual enjoyment, perceptual interactivity, and perceptual value variables on the basis of the extended expectation confirmation model of the information system continuance model. After checking and correcting the prediction questionnaire twice, we adopted the ""Questionnaire Star"" network system to distribute the questionnaire and conducted offline questionnaire surveys of borrowers of Shandong University Library, University of Jinan Library, and Shandong Library. A theoretical model of the continuous use behavior of users in the VLC is constructed using the structural equation model. The survey data were empirically analyzed to explore the influencing factors and mechanism of the continuous use behavior of users in the VLC. Interaction perception, value perception, and perceptual normativeness exerted a significant positive impact on user-perceived usefulness and expectation confirmation, whereas perceptual enjoyment had little effect on perceived usefulness. This study also summarized the relationship between usersâ€™ continuous use behavior, continuous willingness and perceived usefulness, expectation confirmation, satisfaction, self-efficacy, and contributing factors in the VLC on the basis of the data results.

This paper also examines the adoption of OI within a firm's practices and models, and within the three dimensions of firm sustainability. Design/methodology/approach - Survey data from 48 specialized SMEs manufacturing supercars were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. SmartPLS software was used to conduct a path analysis and test the proposed framework. Findings - The findings suggest that high adoption of OI models tends to increase firm innovativeness. Similarly, the adoption of OI practices has a positive effect on innovativeness but to a lesser extent than OI models. The moderation results of innovativeness further show that OI models and practices can benefit the performance of SMEs. Specifically, two dimensions of performance - environmental and social performance - were found to be greatly influenced by OI. Research limitations/implications - Due to parsimony in the investigated model, this study only focuses on OI adoption as practices and models without considering its drivers or other contingency factors. Practical implications - This paper could help practitioners in SMEs better understand the benefits of adopting OI to be more innovative but also more sustainable.

This is a perpetual problem given learning environments are constantly changing due to technological innovation. Using technology to create technology-enhanced learning environments (TEL) to increase student engagement, satisfaction and achievement and promote self-regulated learning practices/behaviours in the student cohort, a subsequent research question arises: what outcomes emerge from team-based curriculum design (TBCD) involving academics and experts, such as user-experience designers and learning scientists? This presentation describes a project at Western Sydney University in Australia that aimed to: (1) implement and evaluate an innovative TEL environment in a flipped and blended undergraduate media course; and (2) critically review a model of TBCD engagement; and (3) explore opportunities for scalability to other units at the university. Key features of the case study will be discussed, which include choice of technology to support the design of the innovative TEL environment, analysis of observational data from the perspective of the TBCD team, and analysis of student analytics and feedback data from surveys. Preliminary findings are indicating increased student participation and engagement with learning materials within the TEL environment. In addition, the TBCD partnership has provided critical insights into the practice of members of the team, and the emerging model may have future applications within other disciplines.

Open forms of collective learning, user engagement and social networks have become popular to generate IPs and values. Meanwhile, government policy can support the sectors through subsidies, regulations, standardization, and protections at regional and national levels. This paper aims to explore the role of government policy in the innovation of creative industries from a macro dynamic perspective. The research method combines a structured literature review, a secondary document review of industry reports and government policy, and thematic content analysis. Through in-depth studies of the UKâ€™s and Chinaâ€™s animation sectors, the paper identifies key elements of closed innovation, social innovation, and open innovation systems in the market. Comparisons of national government policies since 2000 reveal different approaches for countries where creative sectors are well-established, and for those starting with limited knowledge resources. A dynamic model is developed to address the evolution of macro dynamic innovation systems and the role of policies as interactive mechanisms.

Indian firms which were previously catering to domestic demand are now the exporters of major agricultural machinery such as tractors and pesticides. Design/methodology/approach Rapid growth in demand for the agricultural inputs and improvement in technology implementations have led us to study the performance and transformation of these input industries. An empirical analysis was performed on the listed agricultural input firms during 2001-2019 to investigate the relationship between the R&D efforts and growth of firms in the seed, pesticide, fertiliser and agricultural machinery industries using the system-generalised methods of moments (GMM) technique on the panel of 1,320 firm-year observations. Findings The findings reveal that investments in innovations have a positive and lagged effect on the growth of firms in the Indian agricultural inputs industry. A further analysis reveals that younger firms grow faster when they invest in R&D. More specifically, the author finds evidence in the case of the agricultural inputs industry that import of raw materials negatively affects the firms' growth (FG) and export intensity (EI) positively affects the growth in the case of R&D firms. Investments in R&D are also seen to enable firms to reap benefits from externalities present in the industry. Research limitations/implications This study suggests that the government should encourage the industries to invest optimally in R&D projects by providing favourable fiscal treatments and R&D subsidies which are observed to have positive effects in various developed countries. Originality/value There are very few studies that have explored the impact of R&D expenditure on the firm performance in agricultural inputs industry, especially in an emerging economy context like India.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JADEE-07-2020-0156,WOS,Journal

Findings - The statistical results imply that explorative learning has a positive impact on improvisational creativity and innovation while improvisational creativity has a positive influence on compositional creativity and innovation as well. Compositional creativity and innovation are also positively associated. Surprisingly, improvisational creativity mediates the relationship between explorative learning and innovation. Furthermore, PLS-multi group analysis reveals that heterogeneity exists in the collected data and number of employees is a moderating variable. The results of the research indicate that companies with number of employees between 51 and 100 are more creative and innovative in comparison with other groups. On the other hand, the positive relationship between explorative learning and compositional creativity was not supported in this research.

Several institutional and conductive factors affecting a country's capacity to support innovative entrepreneurship are explored. Design/methodology/approach Institutional theory is used to examine the national regulatory, normative, cognitive and conducive aspects that measure a country's ability to support innovative entrepreneurship. A cross-national institutional profile is constructed to validate an entrepreneurial innovation model. The impacts of country-level national institutions on innovative entrepreneurial activity as measured by Global Entrepreneurship Monitor data are assessed through structural equation modeling. Findings Knowledge about the influence of specific institutional aspects on innovative entrepreneurship, and hence of institutional structures within and across countries, is enhanced. For new innovative enterprises, conductive and regulatory aspects seem to matter most. All conductive factors have a significant and positive impact on entrepreneurial activity rates. Research limitations/implications Results could support policy makers and practitioners in evaluating government policies' effects on innovative entrepreneurship. Interventions should target both individual attributes and context. Future research could include longitudinal designs to measure the direction of causality. Practical implications Aspects such as regulatory institutions, and conductive factors such as information communication technology use and technology adoption, are important for innovation entrepreneurship development.

We invested in a mix of desk research with qualitative methods, including interviews, surveys, or ethnographic explorations, together with participatory workshops for collective vision building and speculative prototyping for policy. Our main findings underline key sociotechnical challenges and opportunities for the development and uptake of Blockchain in specific European industrial and business contexts, taking into account the complexity of policy, economic, social, technical, legal and environmental elements. But, aiming to push the frontiers of what's common practice in advice for policy when looking into early-stage technologies as Blockchain, we also strive to emphasize how our approach can benefit decision-makers through robust methodological and conceptual processes that are simultaneously evidence-based and experimental in their delivery and impact.

An enormous acceleration of ready-to-use tools and artificial intelligence (AI) applications, shaped by the emergence, refinement, and application of powerful ML algorithms in several areas of knowledge, is ongoing. Although such progress has begun to permeate the medical sciences and clinical medicine, implementation in cardiovascular medicine and research is still in its infancy. Objectives To lay out the theoretical framework, purpose, and structure of a novel AI consortium. Methods We have established a new Dutch research consortium, the CVON-AI, supported by the Netherlands Heart Foundation, to catalyse and facilitate the development and utilisation of AI solutions for existing and emerging cardiovascular research initiatives and to raise AI awareness in the cardiovascular research community. CVON-AI will connect to previously established CVON consortia and apply a cloud-based AI platform to supplement their planned traditional data-analysis approach. Results A pilot experiment on the CVON-AI cloud was conducted using cardiac magnetic resonance data. It demonstrated the feasibility of the platform and documented excellent correlation between AI-generated ventricular function estimates as compared to expert manual annotations. The resulting AI solution was then integrated in a web application. Conclusion CVON-AI is a new consortium meant to facilitate the implementation and raise awareness of AI in cardiovascular research in the Netherlands. CVON-AI will create an accessible cloud-based platform for cardiovascular researchers, demonstrate the clinical applicability of AI, optimise the analytical methodology of other ongoing CVON consortia, and promote AI awareness through education and training.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12471-019-1281-y,WOS,Journal

There is a consensus on the significant improvements in motivation and engagement through the use of gamification mechanisms applied to education. However the gamification of content and its implementation in an educational software is not a simple process and needs to be studied. The use of formal techniques for application of gamification mechanisms in educational software has still been little explored and there is no consensus on the subject. Some works focus on, just use some of the mechanisms of gamification, such as medals, points, rankings and feedback empirically and unsystematically. Gamification is the use of game design elements in extra-game contexts. In education and in the academic setting, gamification is still new and the main works on the subject are mostly concentrated in the current decade. According to the author of The gamification of learning and instruction, major work on the subject, the gamification can be used to promote learning, recycling a typical content presented in a traditional class time or distance by including game elements, such as quests, points and medals, interconnected to create a learning opportunity in the form of a game. The use of a software architecture for a particular domain is a way to define and describe stable environments for formal and systematic development of educational software. If architecture consider the gamification mechanisms Gamified Educational Software (GES) Development probability quality is more likely. The architecture of a system reflects that all decisions should be taken in the design of a computer system, determining the organization and overall structure of the system. A classic definition of software architecture tells what is the system in terms of computational components and the relationships between them. The importance of software architecture for educational applications was recognized by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), which proposed as part of its standardization efforts, the definition of a reference model Learning Technology Systems Architecture (LTSA). However the use of techniques for application of gamification mechanisms in educational software has still been little explored and there is no consensus on the subject. This research aims to study the two problems presented: the need for stable environments for formal and systematic development of educational software and the need for efficient ways to engage students in the learning process. This work was based on a descriptive research methodology in the form of case study. The proposed research aims to relate the requirements, both functional and nonfunctional, to compose a gamified educational software GES) architecture based on LTSA and case study based on the development of a GES using the proposed architecture.",2016,,WOS,Conference Paper

While often characterised by enhanced productivity and resource/energy efficiency, current perspectives are largely descriptive with limited practical relevance. A hierarchical decision-making framework and a multi-level simulation modelling and optimisation technique are constructed to explore the interplay between Circular Supply Chains and Industry 4.0. The real-world case of blue-green algae as renewable feedstockâ€“to derive value-added omega-3 oils and biofertilisersâ€“is investigated to develop â€˜Circular Economy 4.0â€™ perspectives. The emerging circular supply network utilises micro-factories (i.e., photobioreactors), continuous manufacturing technologies (i.e., piezoelectric transducers), and drone operations for feedstock availability monitoring. This study contributes to theory and practice by building on the limited empirical research exploring determinants of successful transitions in Circular Economy-Industry 4.0 network contexts. Four design principles are proposed that capture the interplay between digital technologies and network design configurations, e.g., centralisedâ€“semi-centralisedâ€“decentralised. Modelling is developed across macro-, meso-, and micro-levels of analysis. Results demonstrate significant gains in terms of resources utilisation and market dynamics, enabled by the adoption of digital operations in a circular economy context, with initial insights on the evolution of such networks.

We integrate the well-established knowledge-based theory and the open innovation literature with consideration of the so-called knowledge relations spiral . How knowledge is created, transferred and diffused in an industrial district and how new knowledge and innovations are generated in the process are widely explored issues, we propose however an operational approach to the key concepts in the relevant literature and we test them on a case district: The Apulian Clothing Industrial District for the year 2012. To this end, we consider a multi-stage econometric model, based on a system of simultaneous equations spanning across 1) the influence of firms' relational choices on district innovative performance and 2) the influence of district firms' innovative effort and structural characteristics on their relational choices. Data are derived by administering a questionnaire to a selected sample of district firms. The results support the presence of a knowledge relations spiral at work within the district, generating a continuous exchange of tacit and codified knowledge both within and outside it. In this way an innovation process is created. Finally, the analysis suggests a more proactive role of the institutions to favor the reproduction of the industrial district over time.

Additionally, the research seeks to provide deeper insight into the link between the variables by studying how information technology (IT) resources mediate the relationship between knowledge sources and innovation capability. Design/methodology/approach The study assessed the relationship between latent variables using a quantitative research approach and variance-based structural equation modelling on a sample of 380 individuals from 83 Pakistani manufacturing and service firms. Findings The study's results revealed a significant impact of knowledge sources (internal and external knowledge sources) on radical and incremental innovation. Further, the study examines the mediating role of IT resources in connecting knowledge sources and a firm's innovation capability.

Designing policies that are aimed at achieving such radical transitions in the energy system will require ever more in-depth modelling of end-use demand, efficiency and fuel switching, as well as an increasing need for regional, sectoral, and agent disaggregation to capture technological, jurisdictional and policy detail. Building and using these models entails complex trade-offs between the level of detail, the size of the system boundary, and the available computing resources. The availability of data to characterise key energy system sectors and interactions is also a key driver of model structure and parameterisation, and there are many blind spots and design compromises that are caused by data scarcity. We may soon, however, live in a world of data abundance, potentially enabling previously impossible levels of resolution and coverage in energy economy models. But while big data concepts and platforms have already begun to be used in a number of selected energy research applications, their potential to improve or even completely revolutionise energy economy modelling has been almost completely overlooked in the existing literature. In this paper, we explore the challenges and possibilities of this emerging frontier. We identify critical gaps and opportunities for the field, as well as developing foundational concepts for guiding the future application of big data to energy economy modelling, with reference to the existing literature on decision making under uncertainty, scenario analysis and the philosophy of science.

We systematically review the existing BMI literature, articulating it around three clusters of negative consequences: those affecting the firm as an entity; those affecting the firm's stakeholders; and those that are specific or context-dependent. In a similar fashion, we identify the driving factors and circumstances leading to these negative consequences and group them into four clusters: (1) managerial choices and processes, and three underpinning circumstances that influence such choices or processes; (2) trade-offs between the new and current business models; (3) managers' ability to manage BMI; and (4) context within which BMI is situated. The paper provides the first attempt to gather prior research on the phenomenon and thereby develop a conceptual understanding of the dark side of BMI. Furthermore, by proposing a model that explains how the dark side of BMI may occur, we inform ongoing debates on the theorization of the consequences that may derive from BMI and how these can be managed to support firms' innovative growth, arguing how the disruptive innovation literature can only partially explain the phenomenon. Second, our model provides important foundations to further distil the complex link between BMI and performance.

The path and boundary conditions through which search strategies affect intra-organizational knowledge creation remain elusive. Drawing on recombinant search theory and knowledge-based view, the authors seek to identify knowledge complexity as an important intermediate variable between knowledge search and innovation performance, such as research and development (R&D) output and R&D output quality. A second goal of this study is to examine the moderating roles of government support and technological turbulence. Design/methodology/approach The authors employed a longitudinal panel of 609 global pharmaceutical firms and obtained the firms' patent records from 1980 to 2015 for the analysis. The authors used generalized estimating equations (GEE) to evaluate the models and tested the consistency via panel fixed-effects estimations. Findings The authors' findings show that organizational routine-guided search has a negative effect on knowledge complexity, while routine-changing search exerts a positive impact on knowledge complexity. Governmental support and technological turbulence moderate these relationships. Notably, knowledge complexity has an inverted U-shaped relationship with innovation performance. Research limitations/implications The authors' research context, the pharmaceutical industry, may constrain the generalizability of our findings. In addition, potential types of routine-guided and routine-changing search behaviors were not considered. Practical implications Despite these limitations, this study offers important implications. First, knowledge complexity transmits the effects of knowledge search on innovation performance. Practitioners should balance routine-guided and routine-changing search processes to build and manage complex knowledge. Second, a moderate level of knowledge complexity is the key to good R&D output and R&D output quality.

Consequently, semi-automatic abstraction of complex data within structured information spaces becomes increasingly important, if its knowledge content is to support intuitive, exploratory discovery. Exploration of skill demand is an area where regularly updated, multi-dimensional data may be exploited to assess capability within the workforce to manage the demands of the modern, technology- and data-driven economy. The knowledge derived may be employed by skilled practitioners in defining career pathways, to identify where, when and how to update their skillsets in line with advancing technology and changing work demands. This same knowledge may also be used to identify the combination of skills essential in recruiting for new roles. To address the challenges inherent in exploring the complex, heterogeneous, dynamic data that feeds into such applications, we investigate the use of an ontology to guide structuring of the information space, to allow individuals and institutions to interactively explore and interpret the dynamic skill demand landscape for their specific needs. As a test case we consider the relatively new and highly dynamic field of Data Science, where insightful, exploratory data analysis and knowledge discovery are critical. We employ context-driven and task-centred scenarios to explore our research questions and guide iterative design, development and formative evaluation of our ontology-driven, visual exploratory discovery and analysis approach, to measure where it adds value to users' analytical activity. Our findings reinforce the potential in our approach, and point us to future paths to build on. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Managing this tension successfully leads to so-called ambidexterity. How to achieve it is still a matter of debate: proponents of structural approaches recommend a separation of exploration and exploitation, while proponents of so-called contextual ambidexterity suggest that contextual factors such as culture and process are equal if not more critical in leading the organization to ambidexterity. Based on the findings of empirical ambidexterity research, many more factors are suggested, though they are rarely researched in an ambidexterity context nor are the interdependencies between the factors and the known ambidexterity strategies described. To guide future research, this paper develops an expanded and system-focused framework for achieving ambidexterity. It is used to review and integrate findings from organizational theory and neighboring disciplines, including project management theories, knowledge management theories, human resource management theories, and open and distributed innovation theories. Managerial implications are discussed and illustrated with a case example. The resulting work provides the basis for explicitly modeling the drivers and inhibitors of exploration and exploitation and their interdependencies. In future research, this can be used to better understand and overcome conflicting objectives, devise new approaches for achieving ambidexterity, and ultimately design more successful organizations.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0219877019500329,WOS,Journal

However, the vast majority of Knowledge Bases (KBs) are incomplete, necessitating a demand for KB completion (KBC). Methods of KBC used in the mainstream current knowledge base include the latent factor model, the random walk model and recent popular methods based on reinforcement learning, which performs well in their respective areas of expertise. Recurrent neural network (RNN) and its variants model temporal data by remembering information for long periods, however, whether they also have the ability to use the information they have already remembered to achieve complex reasoning in the knowledge graph. In this paper, we produce a novel framework (ALSTM) based on the Attention mechanism and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), which associates structure learning with parameter learning of first-order logical rules in an end-to-end differentiable neural networks model. In this framework, we designed a memory system and employed a multi-head dot product attention (MHDPA) to interact and update the memories embedded in the memory system for reasoning purposes. This is also consistent with the process of human cognition and reasoning, looking for enlightenment for the future in historical memory. In addition, we explored the use of inductive bias in deep learning to facilitate learning of entities, relations, and rules. Experiments establish the efficiency and effectiveness of our model and show that our method achieves better performance in tasks which include fact prediction and link prediction than baseline models on several benchmark datasets such as WN18RR, FB15K-237 and NELL-995.

The objective of this study is to investigate high-impact print parameters on the printing printability and develop a preliminary machine learning model to optimize printing parameters. The results of this study will lead to an exploration of machine learning applications in bioprinting and to an improved understanding between 3D printing parameters and structural printability.

Physicians in training receive little exposure to the implications, drawbacks, and methodologies of upcoming technologies prior to their deployment. As a result, there is an increasing need for the incorporation of innovation and technology (I&T) training, starting in medical school. Objective: We aimed to identify and describe curricular and extracurricular opportunities for innovation in medical technology in US undergraduate medical education to highlight challenges and develop insights for future directions of program development. Methods: A review of publicly available I&T program information on the official websites of US allopathic medical schools was conducted in June 2020. Programs were categorized by structure and implementation. The geographic distribution of these categories across US regions was analyzed. A survey was administered to school-affiliated student organizations with a focus on I&T and publicly available contact information. The data collected included the founding year, thematic focus, target audience, activities offered, and participant turnout rate. Results: A total of 103 I&T opportunities at 69 distinct Liaison Committee on Medical Education-accredited medical schools were identified and characterized into the following six categories: (1) integrative 4-year curricula, (2) facilitated doctor of medicine/master of science dual degree programs in a related field, (3) interdisciplinary collaborations, (4) areas of concentration, (5) preclinical electives, and (6) student-run clubs. The presence of interdisciplinary collaboration is significantly associated with the presence of student-led initiatives (P=.001). ""Starting and running a business in healthcare"" and ""medical devices"" were the most popular thematic focuses of student-led I&T groups, representing 87% (13/15) and 80% (12/15) of respondents, respectively. ""Career pathways exploration for students"" was the only type of activity that was significantly associated with a high event turnout rate of >26 students per event (P=.03). Conclusions: Existing school-led and student-driven opportunities in medical I&T indicate growing national interest and reflect challenges in implementation. The greater visibility of opportunities, collaboration among schools, and development of a centralized network can be considered to better prepare students for the changing landscape of medical practice.

Therefore, it is of great significance to explore the impact of entrepreneurial leadership on enterprises' technological innovation. OBJECTIVE: From the perspective of technological innovation stream, we divide ambidextrous innovation into mainstream innovation and new stream innovation. Integrating ambidexterity theory, innovation streams theory and cognitive affective personality system theory (CAPS), we explore the mediating mechanism of entrepreneurial ambidextrous leadership on ambidextrous innovation from cognitive path, affective path and cognitive-affective compound path. METHODS: Based on the data collected from 254 top managers in 12 provinces in China, we conducted descriptive statistical analysis, reliability and validity analysis, regression analysis and bootstrap mediating effect test on the sample data. RESULTS: Our empirical results revealed that: 1) entrepreneurial ambidextrous leadership positively related with the ambidextrous innovation; 2) organizational paradoxical cognition plays a partly mediating role between ambidextrous leadership and ambidextrous innovation; 3) organizational affective conflict plays a partly mediating role between ambidextrous leadership and ambidextrous innovation; 4) organizational paradoxical cognition negatively related with organizational affective conflict; 5) organizational paradoxical cognition and organizational affective conflict play a chain mediating role between entrepreneurial ambidextrous leadership and ambidextrous innovation.

These capabilities then facilitate suppliers in climbing the value chain from B-to-B to B-to-C. Design/methodology/approach The study adopted a longitudinal and multiple case study design to examine the practices of suppliers operating in a traditional emerging economy setting. This study selected Pakistan textile industry as an empirical setting, which is a predominantly supplier market for global buyers. Data sources entail semi-structured interviews with top executives and senior-level managers in four case firms and secondary data obtained from diverse sources. Findings The study identified transitionary phases of capabilities development that are facilitated by boundary-spanning knowledge acquisition and transformation in a dynamic manner. These capabilities are essential for a supplier's entry into downstream international markets (i.e. launching its own products/brands in the end consumers' market). Practical implications The findings could help managers in STEEs to understand the strategic importance of supply chain ties in their learning and capabilities development. It also provides strategic insights on what, how and why involved parties do engage over an extended period of time. Moreover, the findings of this study could help other firms to know and adopt the right type of technology(s) and systems that can help them reduce the technological gap in producing and marketing market-winning products. Originality/value This study advances the recent academic discussion that focusses on learning by supplying and the value-chain movement of suppliers (i.e. B-to-C) from their B-to-B engagements.

Green intellectual capital (IC) has been considered to be a vitally important mechanism for companies to move towards green production. By adopting the Intellectual capital-based view (ICV) as the underpinning theory, this study aims to investigate the green intellectual capital and social innovation tie-up. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative research approach was adopted in this study. The mail survey was used to collect data from managers of 509 manufacturing units operating in J&K, India. The study model was tested using structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings: Based on the SEM results, the key factors that significantly influence social innovation were green human capital and green structural capital. The results also posited that green relational capital was not significantly related to social innovation. Originality/value: As revealed by the existing literature, no similar work has been done yet. Therefore, this study's originality lies in its exploration of green intellectual capital (IC) and social innovation interplay in an environmentally sensitive sector, manufacturing.

They exhibit multiple storage mechanisms, two of which are linked to the free and adsorbed gas phase. Since the adsorbed gas may be stored as a denser phase than the free gas, the contribution of the adsorbed phase can be significant. The adsorbed volume is related to the total organic carbon (TOC) and thus, higher TOC can indicate higher hydrocarbon inplace. Furthermore, productivity can be linked to TOC through the potential for overpressure and conversion of kerogen to pore space. However, estimation of the TOC is not a trivial problem, as it depends on geological factors such as depositional environment. In this study, we propose an integrated workflow using concepts of machine learning to estimate TOC. The workflow is divided into 3 sections which are area selection, sub-region categorization, and prediction modeling. Firstly, 3 active exploration and development areas (Kaybob, Pembina, and East shale basin) of the Duvernay Formation are highlighted and the geology of each specific area is analyzed. Thereafter, using the available core data and average properties of the attributes (Gamma Ray, resistivity, density, and distance from mean vitrinite reflectance line), each area is clustered into sub-regions using SVM, logistic regression, and k-means clustering. Finally, using Random Forest prediction, models for each sub-region are developed and ranked with average mean square errors and standard deviations. It is observed that the Kaybob area can be clustered into 2 regions. This observation is supported by the principal component plot (PC1 vs PC2), which shows a dual cloud structure. This is further supported through clustering analysis, which also revealed the same observation. Results of the prediction modeling found random forest as the best predictor, achieving a match wiht the core data with a error less than 10% and in some cases only a 1% deviation. Shale reservoir characterization requires estimation of the key parameters such as TOC. However, it is difficult to estimate TOC with purely physics-based or purely statistical models, as it requires limited specialized data and is impacted by subtle variations in the reservoir. This study suggests that TOC can be accurately estimated by combining geological interpretation and machine learning based algorithms without bearing cost of the specialized data.

Vargo and Lusch (2004) and Gronross (2007) identify service innovation and improvement as an important means to enhance market orientation and increase firmsâ€™ success in terms of profitability, competitiveness and customer loyalty. However due to the specific characteristics of services (Djellal and Gallouj 2001; Menor et al. 2002) i.e., their intangibility, co-production with customers, simultaneity, heterogeneity and perishability (Fitzsimmons and Fitzsimmons 2000; Avlonitis et al. 2001) their development process is to a certain degree unique. As services primarily are processes that are simultaneously produced and consumed, these processes vary and so does the resulting output (Alonso-Rasgado et al. 2004). This complex, relatively intangible, constitution of services, together with the large range of service types, makes services difficult to relate to during new service development (Menor et al. 2002; Johne and Storey 1998). To counter the dynamic nature of services, some earlier studies support the integration of consumers in the service innovation process (Aa and Elfring 2002, Matthing et al. 2004). Matthing et al. (2004) state that â€˜Altogether, new service development relies on the difficult task of understanding and anticipating changing customer needs, with little help from traditional market researchâ€™, laying emphasis on novel ways to articulate informal consumer knowledge. In this regard, Goffin and Mitchell (2005) and Juarasin (2010) distinguish between two components of innovation in services: service products (manner in which the services are produced and delivered to customers) and service augmetation (manner to ensure service quality, e.g. customer contact, quality of the contact and the serviscape or ambient conditions). These two components combine to form the augmented service offering, an important aspect of which is to incorporate clients experiences and capabilities, a shift from service provider to service co-creation paradigm, in line with the changing role of customers and the value of understanding their needs and problems steming from services. As more and more studies realise the potential of user knwoledge in service innovation, firms are faced with the dual challenge: (a) to identify relevant sources of user knowledge, i.e. from where to get consumer need information pertaining to service innovation, and (b) how to cater to consumersâ€™ expectations in the inhomogeneous and overcrowded market landscape with large array of products, i.e. to gather information efficiently about a large range of products. As consumer conversations shift online, one possible solution may be to listen to consumer discourses in the virtual space through monitoring the Brand Communities, which contain abundant brand related informal knowledge. Muniz and Oâ€™Guinn (2001) observe that these communities may be of special interest for firms as they behave as information sharing hubs for admirers of a particular brand or product and hold consumer conversations specific to one brand or product in a condensed and relevant form. Although many online platforms such as discussion boards, consumer forums, virtual communities etc. co exist, brand communities (BC) are likely to be the most relevant platforms to listen and engage consumers towards their service innovation efforts as they are formed and structured around a single brand or product, hence acting as information hubs, focused on a specific brand or product. This study intends to address this theme by exploring the potential of brand communities in the context of service innovation. To this objective, one brand community was identified and a ten-month- long netnographic study was conducted. Netnography as research methodology was adopted as it is especially suited to study digitized consumer communities formed through Computer Mediated Communication (CMC). The study followed the nethnographic procedure drawn by Kozinets (2002). At the initial stage the community was observed in a non systematic manner, to become familiar with the particular culture and codes of the group, next the forums of the selected brand community were searched by key words, twenty individual and fifty combinations (e.g. service, store experience, home service, delivery, problem, after sales, experience etc.). In total over 8,000 messages were collected, coded and classified using NVIVO 9. The emerging themes form the basis of our findings, which suggest that monitoring brand communities can provide firms with consumer insights pertaining to (a) â€œservice productsâ€, (b) quality of â€œservice augmentationâ€ in the serviscape, (c) efficiency of the customer contact, and (d) overall service experience on three levels: interpersonal service, remote service, and self-service. These insights can provide firms with informal consumer knowledge about their overall service experience, which firms can use to improve existing â€œservice productsâ€ and the overall quality of â€œservice augmentationâ€ at all customer contact points in the serviscape.

However, the lower processing level of the subsequent commercialization after fruit harvest is becoming one of the main factors to restrict the promotion of the added value and the international market competitiveness for the domestic fruit. Therefore, realizing the automatic classification of fruit grade has become an essential precondition of the modernization for the fruit industry in China. For the automatic classification method of fruit grade based on visible light technology, the working strength is considerably heavy and the cognitive effect is difficult to be satisfied, due to the susceptibility to the subjective factors for the man-made screening mode, such as experience. The corresponding machine screening mode based on the computer vision technology is susceptible to the drawbacks of the objective factors, such as traditional cognitive methods, and the classification result is also hence difficult to achieve satisfied effect. When the feature space and classification criteria are established once, they are un-updated, and are summarized as an open-loop fruit grade cognition mode for traditional machine judgment. Aiming at the defects, a greengage grade intelligent feedback cognitive method with cognitive result entropy measurement index constraint is explored, which imitates the human cognitive process with repeated comparison and inference from global to local. Firstly, under uncertain conditions and finite domain, from the information theory point of view, the greengage grade intelligent decision information system model is established by the representation of unstructured multi-level dynamic features with information completeness evaluation index. Secondly, the feature space data structure and classification criterion of greengage images with clear grade and feature mapping relationship are established based on adaptive structure-based convolutional neural networks and ensemble random vector functional-link net classifiers from global to local. Thirdly, based on the generalized error and generalized entropy theories, the entropy measurement evaluation index is established for the greengage image cognitive results. Finally, the intelligent operation mechanism of dynamic feedback cognition is established based on the measurement index constraint of uncertain process cognitive result. The average recognition accuracy of 1 008 greengage images for our proposed method is 98.15%. Such performance is 7.9% higher than the algorithm based on Gabor wavelet combined with principal component analysis and support vector machine. The performance of the algorithm based on color completed local binary pattern combined with the nearest neighbor classifier is also lower than that of the proposed method, and the average recognition accuracy of it is just 92.77%. Moreover, compared with the algorithm based on the wavelet descriptor combined with kernel principal component analysis and radial basis function neural network, the recognition accuracy of the proposed method is much better, although the running time is 0.7 s longer. The above mentioned conclusions indicate that the proposed method of adaptive structure convolutional neural networks and ensemble random vector functional-link net classifiers is suitable for the greengage grade machine screening recognition to replace the man-made screening mode, which can effectively enhance the generalization ability of the feature space and the robustness of the classifier. This study provides a reference for the rapid and accurate greengage grade machine cognition based on visible light.

It synthesizes the research in the current special issue (SI) of Multinational Business Review (MBR) on this topic. In addition, this paper differs from other work on this topic in examining entrepreneurship and innovation from a more global standpoint with relevant international effects. Design/methodology/approach The paper provides an overview of the literature on entrepreneurship, innovation and key related topics such as firm and economic growth, as well as linking this research to related international works. It also summarizes the papers of the SI. Findings The authors' analysis suggests that the study of entrepreneurship and innovation should be placed in the context of a country's economic development and institutional environment as well as the firm internationalization trajectories and business models. In addition, the authors believe that a good understanding of economic growth in a transition economy like China (which is a key goal of China's recent emphasis on innovation) is facilitated by understanding the comparative advantages and disadvantages of an economy with respect to the global innovation system. Originality/value The authors' study explores the local-global and parent-subsidiary connectivity and co-evolution of firm strategies and the institutional environment in entrepreneurship and innovation in emerging and transition economies. The authors summarize and synthesize the papers in this SI to provide the results as well as some directions for future research in the domain of entrepreneurship, innovation and new venture creation, which is believed to be a key engine of economic growth in the coming years.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/MBR-08-2018-0058,WOS,Journal

This includes both threats and opportunities, not only in relation to reputation, which is often mentioned in this context, but, even more importantly, in relation to innovation capability and legislative change on inevitably more and more sustainability-driven markets. It is, however, unclear through which mechanisms such sustainability risks currently affect companies and how they can be systematically identified and managed. Based on the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development, this study investigates the dynamics and implications of society's sustainability transition from a company risk management perspective. In addition, exploratory and descriptive studies were conducted at two large product innovation companies to identify current risk management practices and preconditions for sustainability integration. The results reveal that a society moving closer towards a collapse of environmental and social systems leads to increasing sustainability-related threats for unsustainable businesses and increasing opportunities for sustainable businesses. Also, risk management is found to be a promising way for maneuvering in a smart zone between being too passive and being too pro-active in relation to sustainable innovation. The study participants at the case companies were knowledgeable about risk management in general but were largely unfamiliar with risks associated with sustainability and no processes or support tools exist to work systematically with such risks. Key steps to accomplishing an integration of a strategic sustainability perspective into risk management are proposed as: (i) identifying the effects of sustainability issues on internal and external stakeholder value; (ii) actively including sustainability in objective setting and cascading objectives across the levels of the organizational hierarchy; and (iii) developing concrete support for identifying, assessing, and managing economic sustainability risks. Thereby, companies can enhance their competitiveness while providing leadership in the sustainability transition.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10114137,WOS,Journal

Therefore, this paper aims to fill a gap in the literature on knowledge management, based on an analysis of the development and implementation of Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC). This paper examines the processes of developing a standard for classifying patent applications from the perspective of Actor-Network Theory ( ANT). Our findings reveal that standardization in the context of patent classification is primarily shaped by the interaction involving patent offices that belong to the IP5 group. Furthermore, we found evidence that the CPC standard can be regarded as a response to the demands posed by innovative firms requiring accurate patent classification to provide secure protection for their new technologies.

The organizational culture, transformational leadership and innovativeness are also included in the investigation as ascendants and consequences of the focal relation of intellectual capital and knowledge processes. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of 1,418 Polish knowledge workers from the construction, healthcare, higher education and information technology (IT) industries, the empirical model was developed using the structural equation modeling (SEM) method. Findings: The study exposes that the essence of transformational leadership innovativeness oriented is developing all intellectual capital components. To do so, leaders must support both formal and informal knowledge processes through the organizational culture of knowledge and learning. Furthermore, for best results of the knowledge transformation into intellectual capital, the learning culture must be shaped by both components: learning climate and acceptance of mistakes. Practical implications: Presented findings can be directly applied to organizations to enhance innovativeness. Namely, leaders who observe that the more knowledge is formally managed in their organizations, the less effective the knowledge exchange is-should put more effort into supporting informal knowledge processes to smoothly develop human and relational intellectual capital components. Shortly, leaders must implement an authentic learning culture, including the mistakes acceptance component, to use the full organizational potential to achieve intellectual capital growth. Intellectual capital growth is essential for innovativeness. Originality/value: This study presents the â€œbig pictureâ€ of all intellectual capital creation micro-mechanisms linking transformational leadership with organizational innovativeness and explains the â€œknowledge paradoxâ€ identified by Mabey and Zhao (2017). This explanation assumes that intellectual capital components are created informally (i.e. human and relational ones) and formally (i.e. structural ones). Therefore, for best effects, both formal and informal knowledge processes, must be supported. Furthermore, this study exposes that the intensity of all explored micro-mechanisms is industry-specific.

The vast number of IoT sensors produce high volume data for a wide variety of applications, such as intelligent house, intelligent health, intelligent engineering, smart transport, intelligent grid and intelligent agriculture. In order to promote improved decision-making, efficiency and precision, reviewing these data is a vital mechanism that renders IoT a successful market concept and paradigm-enhancing quality of living. While it is promising to improve the quality of our lives to obtain covered knowledge and inferences from IoT data, this is a complex task which traditional paradigms cannot carry out. Deep learning can play a key role in developing smarter IoT, as it has demonstrated promising effects in a number of areas such as image recognition, knowledge gathering, voice recognition, natural language processing, indoor location, physiological and psychological condition identification, etc. In this context it becomes imperative to explore the capacity of Deep Learning for IoT data processing.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on the transformational leadership theory and the team learning theory, it is proposed that all four dimensions of transformational leadership, including intellectual stimulation, individualized consideration, inspirational motivation and idealized influence, have unique impact on employee knowledge sharing. It is further proposed that psychology safety and team efficacy mediate these relationships. Then data were collected from over 400 employees from knowledge-based companies in China to empirically test the proposed relationships with the method of structural equation modeling. Findings: The results show that psychological safety fully mediated the impact of intellectual stimulation on knowledge sharing, and team efficacy fully mediated the impact of inspirational motivation on knowledge sharing. Both factors also mediated the impact of individualized consideration on knowledge sharing. The results thus provide empirical support for the impact of transformational leadership on employee knowledge sharing in an international context. Originality/value: The past years have seen increasing interest in leadership and knowledge sharing in emerging markets, yet the mechanism through which leadership affects employee knowledge sharing remains understudied. This study explores the impact of different dimensions of transformational leadership on employee knowledge sharing, and further shows that psychological safety and team efficacy mediate these relationships in a collectivistic society where knowledge sharing is consistent with cultural norms. The findings help develop more robust knowledge sharing theories in the international context and provide insightful suggestions for management practitioners in emerging markets.

(2020),AMCP partnership forum: What's next for specialty medication benefit design and reimbursement,Journal of Managed Care and Specialty Pharmacy,,10.18553/jmcp.2020.20121,"Rising specialty drug costs present a challenge for patients and payers. High-cost products, such as gene therapies or immunotherapies, can significantly affect the budget of a payer that does not have the ability to spread risk across a large population. Stakeholders are considering new reimbursement and benefit designs for specialty medications to improve efficiencies and better manage costs. The potential effect of changes to specialty medication benefit designs and reimbursement systems on patient care, access to medications, and the overall health care system are important considerations when assessing the benefits and challenges associated with reform proposals. Options to better manage the affordability of specialty medications are needed to ensure that patients can continue to access medications, while allowing payers to remain good stewards of health care dollars and supporting marketplace competition and incentives to stimulate innovation. New benefit designs that address these needs, while also supporting marketplace competition and providing incentives that stimulate innovation, have been considered. To explore options, AMCP convened a multidisciplinary stakeholder forum on December 10-11, 2019, in Alexandria, VA. Health care leaders representing academia, health plans, integrated delivery systems, industry leaders, pharmaceutical manufacturers, pharmacy benefit managers, employers, federal government agencies, national health care provider organizations, and patient advocacy organizations participated in the forum. The forum was designed for stakeholders to discuss strategies for the following: (a) reduce costs for beneficiaries while maintaining or improving access to prescription drugs; (b) support marketplace competition and incentives for biopharmaceutical innovation; (c) minimize physicians' financial risk associated with managing drug inventories; (d) remove adverse reimbursement incentives for prescribing higher priced drugs; (e) consider the cost-effectiveness of treatments and services across the health care continuum; and (f) support quality measurement and program evaluation metrics. Recommendations emerging from the forum included creation of novel payment models for the most expensive therapies that allow for larger risk pools, while maintaining the sustainability of the reinsurance market remains. Simplification and standardization were cited as goals for system reform and technological innovations that allow health care providers to view cost-effectiveness information at the point of prescribing, combined with value-based contracting were also recommended. Finally, ensuring that plans remain patient-centric and are designed to address patient needs holistically was stressed as an important goal. Â© 2020, Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy.

Organizations are yet to test its utilization as an intangible strategic resource at a time when organizational strategic landscapes - rapidly changing in a globally networked digitally empowered world - require them to enhance capability of combining resources for meeting stakeholders' expectations. Design/methodology/approach Blockchain as an emerging technology draws frequent industry announcements and specialists' posts on daily basis in media, and there exist inadequacies with respect to the availability of relevant studies in the extant literature on the subject of blockchain, which itself is in infancy. Keeping in view the limitations associated with the traditional understandings of scholarship underscoring, thereby that research and knowledge discovery have been restricting the progress across disciplines on account of which knowledge domains fail to make a meaningful effect; research design of the paper comprises the scholarship of integration method, which might appear to be less systematic but was more emergent in comparison to a traditional methodology of systematic literature review, and suitable for conducting this study. Findings Findings of this study suggest that blockchain with huge popularity as a technological innovation has huge potentialities and promises to be a strategic intangible resource for organizations helpful in attaining sustained advantage. However, the findings also suggest several cautionary remarks.

They face global competition, are under-resourced, and suffer from weaker institutional support. It is suggested that to innovate successfully in this context, indigenous firms would benefit from focusing on managing their current knowledge base more efficiently. We know little about how knowledge management works outside developed economies and which knowledge governance mechanisms have more influence than others in the context of emerging economies. To address this gap, we explore how context may matter for the use of knowledge governance mechanisms and their effect on innovation performance in Brazilian firms. Using the survey data of 109 firms, structural equation modelling, and cluster analysis, our findings suggest that the joint application of knowledge-focused rewards, organizational design, and information and communication technologies that support knowledge processes is critical for boosting innovation performance. We discuss how the peculiarities of the Brazilian context may shape these findings.

The authors introduce an institutional lens in order to understand how offshoring to institutionally distant locales affects innovation outcomes of multinational enterprises. This lens is aimed to provide an analytical tool that is less coarse and less overwhelmingly focused on institutional distance (ID) as a harsh and certain harbinger of reduced innovation performance. Design/methodology/approach - The authors use primary data from the Offshoring Research Network as well as secondary data from the Frasier Institute on Economic Freedom, and Hofstede's cultural value survey to empirically assess the distinct effects of distance on innovation at the firm level. Findings - The authors have developed a model of distance and innovation which goes beyond the traditional assumption of distance as overwhelmingly negative. Whereas in some cases, the positive effect of formal and informal distances outweigh the negative effects stimulating innovation; in other cases, the negative effects of distance hamper innovation. Finally, some elements of distance may not have an impact on innovation outcomes at all. Research limitations/implications - While previous research stresses the negative effects of distance in general, the authors provide an ID model which, in the context of offshoring, takes into account potential positive, negative, or no effects. Practical implications - The study presents global supply chain managers with a reference framework for making strategic offshoring relationships decisions. Originality/value - By unbundling the inherently confounding formative construction of distance measures, eschewing the reflexive assumption that distance is always negative, and mapping theories specific to the application of distinct institutional logics to specific value-enhancing business activities (i.e. innovation), this study offers a more accurate and complete institutional picture that helps reconcile institutional theory with an empirical record that often fails to find what it predicts.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IMR-03-2016-0065,WOS,Journal

Meta-heuristic like swarm, evolutionary or physics based methods essentially form an expert system which may strive for the search of optimum solution. However, these methods have their own merits and demerits. To supersede the performance of existing systems in context of real time and advanced problems and to propose new intelligent method having an optimal balance between exploration and exploitation phase have become a center of focus of the expert system design. Therefore, being inspired from such a scenario, a hybrid advanced player selection strategy based population search (HAPS-PS) technique is proposed and evaluated in this paper in context of modern applications. Methods: Sport is a multi-functional activity where different learning methods like cooperative, competitive and self-learning variants along with interactive environmental features help to improve the performance of the players. The properties of playing activity and the thematic learning process of sports, along with some features like, chaotic map based initialization, pool based topological structure selection, integration of blended laplacian operator etc. contributes in the design of HAPS-PS. Also a novel mechanism of team reformation through elimination of comparatively poor players and recruitment of new talents is employed. It provides diversification and regulates the search agents in a promising direction. Results: We have comprehensively evaluated the performance of the HAPS-PS by applying it on standard benchmark problems and on various shifted rotated, hybrid and composite problems of CEC2013 and CEC2014. Also some of the competitive problems of CEC 2017 are tested using the proposed method and they are also compared with other state-of-the-art algorithm to validate the efficacy of the system. Further, tests are carried out on some real-world problems from CEC2011 which includes applications related to parameter optimization of frequency-modulated (FM) sound wave, minimization of molecular potential energy of Lennard-Jones cluster, controlling the chemical reactors, and evaluation of the inter atomic tersoff potentials for covalent systems of silicon. The proposed method is also applied on spread spectrum radar polyphase code design problem as a part of real world application. The comparative results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of HAPS-PS.

Based on the insufficiency of existing research and the need for enterprise management practices, this paper uses the Chinese subsidiaries of Korean MNCs as an example to study and explore how knowledge management and dynamic capabilities affect ambidextrous innovation and the relationship between ambidextrous innovation and subsidiary performance. Design/methodology - From January to March 2019, this study collected 341 valid questionnaires using a survey company specializing in China for the members of the Chinese subsidiaries of Korean MNCs to verify the hypotheses. Using the collected data, the study model was verified using the Smart PLS 3.0 statistical package. Findings - Knowledge transfer and knowledge sharing have positive effects on dynamic capabilities and ambidextrous innovation, and dynamic capabilities have a positive impact on ambidextrous innovation. Ambidextrous innovation has been shown to have a significant effect on subsidiary performance. In addition, a partial mediating effect of dynamic capabilities on the relationship between knowledge management and ambidexterity innovation was found. Originality/value - In the academic context, this paper contributes theoretically to the relationship between knowledge management and ambidextrous innovation, as well as the mechanism of dynamic capability, and to verify the relationship between ambidextrous innovation and corporate performance.

An analysis of the available literature relating to the key determinants of the country's competitiveness makes it possible to mention that their determinants are not yet completely explored. The issue is that the current literature examines the impact of GDP per capita and human capital while omitting important factors affecting a country's competitiveness. Knowledge capital is one of the main factors of economic growth and competitiveness. Indigenous innovation contributes to the production of knowledge capital, while FDI and import trade are two major pathways for technological diffusion. As a result, when studying the causes of a country's competitiveness, the effects of these elements are not negligible. The following logical processes are used to investigate the topic of main factors of a country's competitiveness: first, a theoretical model outlining the primary factors of a country's competitiveness is studied; second, acceptable measurements for a country's competitiveness are selected; third, a balanced panel data set is created, and unknown parameter estimation is carried out. The GMM two-step panel data estimation technique is the major methodological instrument used in the article. Annual data from 2001 to 2020 on eight macroeconomic variables are included in the database (total 1040 observations per macroeconomic variable (52 countries, 20 years)). The study proved both practically and theoretically that: 1) the lagged value of the dependent variable has a positive and considerable impact on the competitiveness of the country; 2) the labor productivity of a country is an essential factor of competitiveness; the higher a country's labor productivity, the more probable it is to produce and export; 3) human capital and research and development are major sources of knowledge creation that directly contribute to a country's competitiveness; 4) the influence of FDI and imports on competitiveness has been proven to be significant; 5) weak institutions in emerging and developing economies have a negative impact on export sophistication and, as a result, a country's competitiveness.

It is largely unknown how agricultural knowledge providing organisations, such as advisors and science organisations, understand and respond to digital agriculture. The concept of 'organisational identity' is used to describe both initial understandings of, and emerging responses, to digital agriculture, which together show how organisations 'digi-grasp', i.e. make sense of and enact digitalisation in their organisations. The understanding is described using aspects of identity change (i.e. the nature, pace, source and context of digital agriculture), while the responses are outlined through the various attributes of organisational identity (i.e. capabilities, practices, services, clients, partners, purpose and values). We explore this question in the context of New Zealand through 29 semi-structured interviews with different types of agricultural knowledge providers, including farm advisors, science organisations, as well as technology providers. The findings show that digitalisation is often understood as farm-centric, despite being considered disruptive both on- and off-farm. These understandings influence an organisation's digitalisation responses to digital agriculture. The responses were often ad-hoc, starting with adapting organisational capabilities, practices and services as their clients and partners require, rather than a strategic approach allowing for more flexibility of roles and processes and changing business models. The ad-hoc approach appears to be a response to uncertainty as digital agriculture is in early stages of development. This indicates that agricultural knowledge and innovation system should better support agricultural knowledge providers in digi-grasping and developing a digitalisation strategy, by anticipating possible futures and reflecting on the consequences of these for value propositions, business models and organisational identities of agricultural knowledge providers.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.njas.2019.100313,WOS,Journal

Governments, organizations and individuals have a key role to play in the transformation of socio-economic structures that integrate the pillars of sustainable development (economic growth, social well-being and environmental responsibility). With this purpose several international initiatives have taken place in the last years in order to stimulate and implement an eco-friendly behavior. Knowledge Management research can help to identify and develop behaviors and practices that stimulate and leverage green knowledge, which aims to improve organizations' eco-innovator performance. We argue that this green knowledge base supports the search for practices and strategies of sustainability and forms the foundation for the development of greener performance trajectories. The purpose of this paper is the identification of a green knowledge foundation that supports and put into practice the eco-innovation potential of organizations. To the best of our knowledge, the literature revision shows very limited studies in this field. While the literature that explores the relationship between innovation and knowledge management is abundant, the same is not true when it goes beyond products/processes/practices towards a broader societal context including sustainability issues. We aim to develop a framework which comes up from the identification of eco-innovation dimensions and knowledge management practices. This framework aims to be a knowledge base that integrates the sustainability problematic. This paper follows a theoretical, deductive approach towards green knowledge of corporate sustainability with an emphasis on eco-innovation.

Unfortunately, this is a complex task, since writing rules that distinguish harmful from non-harmful actions tends to be quite difficult in real-world situations. Therefore, such decisions have historically been made by a small group of powerful AI companies and developers, with limited community input. In this paper, we study how to enable a crowd of non-AI experts to work together to communicate high-quality, reliable constraints to AI systems. We first focus on understanding how humans reason about temporal dynamics in the context of AI behavior, finding through experiments on a novel game-based testbed that participants tend to adopt a long-term notion of harm, even in uncertain situations that do not affect them directly. Building off of this insight, we explore task design for long-term constraint specification, developing new filtering approaches and new methods of promoting user reflection. Next, we develop a novel rule-based interface which allows people to craft rules in an accessible fashion without programming knowledge. We test our approaches on a real-world AI problem in the domain of education, and find that our new filtering mechanisms and interfaces significantly improve constraint quality and human efficiency. We also demonstrate how these systems can be applied to other real-world AI problems (e.g. in social networks).

However, in terms of molecular structure and the corresponding mechanical properties between those of ordered and disordered states, partially ordered silica states are not well-explored in the relevant literature owing to a low probability of appearance in experiments and simulations. The lack of this knowledge significantly hinders the understanding of the inherent mechanism of mechanical properties and limits the applications in many engineering fields. In this study, we present an exploration of the complex interdependent relations of the structural properties of silica over a wide range of free energy surfaces and establish a machine learning-based prediction model via high-throughput molecular dynamics simulations coupling with an enhanced sampling method. Each scale of structure information of samples with varying crystallinity is analyzed. First, descriptors of silica structures were identified and selected as inputs to a deep neural network (DNN). The results indicate that our DNN-based approach can provide an accurate prediction of bulk modulus, shear modulus, and tensile strength of silica samples. Furthermore, the generalizability of the machine learning model is verified on the prediction tasks for much larger silica systems, as well as silica quenched at varying cooling rates. Overall, the enhanced sampling method can reliably accelerate the exploration of free energy surfaces and collection of training samples, and machine learning methods are effective in generating accurate and reliable predictions of mechanical properties of materials over the free energy surface.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jace.17779,WOS,Journal

However, no in-depth exploration has been made on how agricultural clusters form and evolve, especially in the context of China's long-term small-scale rural economy. The purpose of this article is to reveal the formation process and evolution mechanism of agricultural clusters by case study research. With the knowledge flow as the starting point, this article takes the Vegetable Cluster in Shouguang City of Shandong Province, China as an example to construct a theoretical framework in the three dimensions of points (spin-offs of enterprises or farmers), lines (network-spillovers of various innovation) and planes (the formation of new regional industry spaces) and put forward theoretical hypotheses. It is shown that: (1) The local spin-off of seed farmers is the main path in the transformation of traditional farmers into enterprises. (2) The network-spillover and adoption of innovative knowledge promote the derivation of specialized farmers or enterprises and realize regional agricultural specialization and spatial agglomeration. (3) The formation of the agricultural cluster resulted from the joint effects of spin-off derived from the entrepreneurial spirit of the farmers, network-spillover of various agricultural innovations and spatial integration of the agricultural landscape. The formation of local agricultural innovation systems marks the maturity of an agricultural cluster. This article contribute to the field by studying one source of Alfred Marshall's knowledge of external economy from the perspective of spin-offs and innovative spillovers, analyzing the agricultural increasing returns to scale neglected by Krugman, and exploring the micro mechanism of farmers' enterprise-oriented evolution and the formation of agricultural clusters in underdeveloped rural areas.

Design/methodology/approach: This empirical study is based on hotel-level information from a survey including 131 hotels in 2014. Colombia was chosen as a representative of Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey and South Africa (CIVETS) emerging destinations. The relationships were analyzed by structural modeling and partial least squares. Findings: Clustering has a positive direct impact on hotel competitiveness and innovation, and there is a positive effect of innovation on competitiveness. Therefore, the link between clustering and competitiveness is partially mediated through implementation of management innovations. Practical implications: Hotels should actively participate in agglomerated destinations and build relationships with established firms by clustering. Interaction with related firms and implementation of management innovations will lead to increased levels of economic competitiveness. Public policymakers should foster collaborative strategic networking in the hospitality industry of emerging economy destinations. Originality/value: This paper focused on separating the direct and indirect effects of clustering on hotel competitiveness. Implementation of management innovations was considered as an outcome derived from clustering in emerging tourist destinations, using the example of Colombia.

A roadmap for efficiency projections of commercial-type RJ and FJ topologies reaching 24.8% and 23.3% efficiencies, respectively, has been developed to quantify and explain the impact of various technological innovations on the performance of each design. Understanding of mechanisms governing cell operation is crucial to explore factors that limit the efficiency potential of the two device structures. By investigating several key parameters such as front poly-Si sheet resistance and thickness, bulk material properties, and current transport in our simulation model, we determine and explain why RJ cells outperform FJ cells. Our findings reveal that FJ suffers from present technological limitations of p-type poly-Si based passivated contacts-namely, 1) large recombination observed in textured p-TOPCon layers and 2) low boron solid solubility and hole mobility in boron-doped poly-Si which results in very high sheet resistance of the front p-poly-Si emitter that contributes to fill factor degradation, especially when using thin poly-Si layer to reduce absorption losses. RJ on the contrary desensitizes the cell efficiency to front sheet resistance to allow the application of ultra-thin front n-type poly-Si layer and is therefore ideally suited for double-side TOPCon cells.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JPHOTOV.2021.3086461,WOS,Journal

The purpose of this paper is to design and evaluate a curriculum to help engineering design students to learn from failure. Design/methodology/approach: A new curriculum design provided a case study for evaluating the effects of incorporating learning from failure within a civil engineering course. An analysis of the changes in course output was undertaken in relation to graduate destination data covering 2006 to 2016 and student satisfaction from 2012 to 2017 and a number of challenges and solutions for curriculum designers were identified. Findings: The design and delivery of an innovative curriculum, within typical constraints, can provide opportunities for students to develop resilience to failure as an integral part of their learning in order to think creatively and develop novel engineering solutions. The key issues identified were: the selection of appropriate teaching methods, creating an environment for exploratory learning, group and team assessments with competitive elements where practicable and providing students with many different pedagogical approaches to produce a quality learning experience. Originality/value: This case study demonstrates how to design and implement an innovative curriculum that can produce positive benefits of learning from failure. This model can be applied to other disciplines such as building surveying and construction management. This approach underpins the development of skills necessary in the educational experience to develop as a professional building pathologist.

This study aims to answer the question of how to integrate organizations' external institutional pressures and internal knowledge structure to mitigate the challenges in the open innovation process. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a sample of 2,126 observations from the 2012 World Bank Enterprise Survey. A multivariate regression model is designed to explore the impact of external institutional pressure (i.e. coercive pressure, mimetic pressure and normative pressure) on open innovation, as well as the moderating effect of digital knowledge and experience-based knowledge. Findings The results show that institutional pressure has a positive role in promoting open innovation; digital knowledge weakens the positive relationship between institutional pressure and open innovation; experience-based knowledge strengthens the positive relationship between institutional pressure (especially coercive pressure) and open innovation. Originality/value This study combines institutional theory and knowledge management to enriches insights into open innovation in emerging markets. Beyond recognizing the inherent multidimensionality of the concept of institutional pressure, this study creates an integrated path for the legitimacy acquiring of enterprises through the knowledge structure design (i.e. digital knowledge and experience-based knowledge).

Evidence from the SME sector in vietnam,SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION,,10.1016/j.spc.2021.11.008,"This study unfolds the nexus between sustainability innovation, firm performance of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by exploring the mediating role of firm competitiveness in the context of an emerging market. This study adopts a systematic literature review approach which results in arguing that this relationship is not explored in-depth in current literature. This is especially more critical for emerging economies as current literature shows a lack of empirical research in this research topic. A well-structured questionnaire was administrated for data collection. A total of 435 valid responses from top executives, managers, and experts were received and used for data analysis. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to investigate the relationships between constructs and latent variables. Our findings reveal that there is a significant and positive relationship among sustainability innovation and firm competitiveness. Firm competitiveness has a positive and significant relationship with financial, environmental, and operational performance. Moreover, sustainability innovation had an indirect positive and significant effect on financial performance. The statistical results indicate that the indirect effects are all significant (sig. < 0.05) and the order of these indirect effects is consistent with those of direct effects of firm competitiveness on firm performance dimensions. Stakeholder theory is applied to check how firm competitiveness helps improve the performance of SMEs. To the best of our knowledge this study is the first that explores the mediating role of firm competitiveness between sustainability innovation and SMEs' performance.

(2018),Obtaining a Sustainable Competitive Advantage from Patent Information: A Patent Analysis of the Graphene Industry,SUSTAINABILITY,,10.3390/su10124800,"Graphene serves as the most disruptive material in the twenty-first century and plays an unsubstitutable role in solving the sustainable development problems of energy crises, water shortages, and environmental pollution. Recently, obtaining a sustainable competitive advantage (SCA) in the field of graphene has gained increasing attention from both researchers and practitioners. However, few attempts have been made to summarize the SCA of this field by applying patent information. Basing on a patent-based multi-level perspective (MLP), this study aims to develop an approach to identify SCA in the target technological area by conducting a patent review from the comprehensive perspectives of the macro landscape, meso socio-technical system, and micro niches, and then integrate patent analysis with technology life cycle (TLC) theory to examine patents involving global technological competition. The effectiveness of the approach is verified with a case study on graphene. The results show that the graphene field is an emerging and fast-growing technological field, with an increasing number of patents over the year. The TLC of graphene technology demonstrated an approximate S shape, with China, the U.S., Korea, and Japan filing the largest number of graphene patents. Evidenced by Derwent Manual Codes, we found an increase in consideration given to technological application and material preparation topics over time, and research hotspots and fronts that have SCA. In terms of a leading country or region with SCA, the U.S., with a high foreign patent filing rate, large number of high forward citation patents, strong assignees' competitive position, and large number of high-strength patents, was still the most powerful leader, with a higher SCA in the graphene industry. Korea also obtained a relatively higher SCA and will be a promising competitor in this field. Although China was shown to be catching-up very rapidly in the total number of graphene patents, the apparent innovation gaps in the foreign patent filing rate, high value patents, and Industry-University-Research Collaboration will obviously hamper Chinese catch-up efforts for obtaining SCA. As for patentees, the most powerful leaders with a higher SCA represented by Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, International Business Machines Corp, and Nanotek Instruments Inc were identified. In addition, most of the high strength patents were owned by the above patentees. Further, valuable contributions to the understanding of SCA in graphene technology were summarized. First, the proposed patent-based MLP provides a new and comprehensive analytical framework for review research, as well as SCA analysis, and extends its research perspectives. Second, it introduces patent indicators to the previous MLP model, and provides a new theoretical perspective for the study of technological innovation in the previous MLP model. Third, this paper employs the TLC theory to explore the dynamic SCA in the given technology field, which further develops the concept of the MLP model from the temporal dimension. Finally, future research directions were demonstrated. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first systematic review of this field using patent analysis, comprehensively acknowledging the current technological competition and development in the graphene field and that of the future, and can be applied to various other emerging technology fields.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10124800,WOS,Journal

This includes analysis of the various forms of CECs - including virtual power plants, peer-to-peer trading, microgrids, and community-scale energy projects - emerging in a number of developed and developing jurisdictions, including Australia. This analysis suggests that low-carbon transition pathways will be varied, driven by social, technological, and organizational contexts, and shaped by institutional change processes, and interaction with the existing regime and incumbent actors.

(2020),"Innovation policy, scientific research and economic performance: The case of Iran",DEVELOPMENT POLICY REVIEW,,10.1111/dpr.12423,"Motivation Why, despite substantial investment in science and technology infrastructure during the last two decades, has Iran performed relatively poorly in terms of innovation and economic output? The investment has been wide-ranging, from the inclusion of science and technology in the National Development Plans to the impressive growth in the number of science and technology parks and incubators. Iran is among the top five countries in terms of science and engineering graduates, and Iran's scientific publications are among the world's fastest-growing. Purpose This study attempts to discover the reasons for this poor performance despite the investment. Approach and Method This is a qualitative study which tries to explore the research question through extensive archival data and semi-structured interviews. We also use an inductive bottom-up approach for data analysis, including open coding of collected data. Findings Our first level of analysis, based on National Innovation Systems studies, will show that there are two main causes: (a) Iran's industrial policies have been unsuccessful in encouraging domestic firms to export or exposing them to international competition. As a result, there are no meaningful incentives for them to approach technological frontiers by exploiting domestic science and technology infrastructures; (b) whereas universities and research centres have played an important role in the catch-up process of other newly developed countries by engaging practically with the problems that face their societies, Iranian universities and research centres have become article-publishing factories. Our second level of analysis will show that behind these two causes are other important latent factors: the power of incumbents and their efforts to maintain the status quo, and the rules of the game in the fields of science and technology which have discouraged hands-on engagement. This study analyses strategic action literature, and proceeds to emphasize the role of incumbents and those rules of the game in inhibiting innovation and economic success. Policy Implications Effective innovation policy is not just about investing in science and technology infrastructure, but also about industrial policy, exposing domestic firms to international competition, overcoming entrenched interests and changing paths of career advancement in science and technology so that scientists are less inclined to pursue theoretical work and are encouraged to collaborate closely with business to solve practical problems.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/dpr.12423,WOS,Journal

However, it has recently been shown that declining levels of feedback seeking behavior may result in decreased psychological attachment over time. This study aims to explore whether individual adaptivity represents a mechanism through which feed-back seeking affects psychological attachment (i.e., well-being involvement and withdrawal). In addition, the interaction effect of organizational obstruction between individual adaptivity and psychological attachment was examined. Based on three-wave survey data obtained from 273 participants from French organizations, a moderated mediation model was tested using structural equation modeling. Results confirmed that adaptive performance mediated positively the relationship between feedback-seeking and well-being involvement and negatively with withdrawal. Moreover, perceived organizational obstruction moderated negatively the relationship between adaptive performance and withdrawal, and positively that with well-being. These results shed new light on the relationship between proactivity (i.e., feedback seeking behavior) and adaptive performance, but also on the positive short-term contribution of successful adaptation in a perceived obstructive organizational context. Theoretical contributions and practical implications for human resource management are discussed.

Innovative sociotechnical design artifacts involve digital information technologies (IT) being used in ways that result in profound disruptions to traditional ways of doing business and to widespread societal changes. The pervasiveness of DI means that the individuals involved in bringing it about have diverse backgrounds, including application specialists, software engineers, data scientists, business managers, economists, venture capitalists, various user groups, and entrepreneurial leaders. This range of backgrounds means that DI, much more than traditional innovation, leads to varied perspectives on the methods and tools to be used in the development of effective and evolvable complex systems incorporating digital innovations. In this paper we present a new matrix approach to DI based on DSR, entrepreneurship, and innovation theories. Clear strategic guidance allows these multiple stakeholders to make sense of the diverse landscape and to understand when and how different entrepreneurial strategies for innovation can best be applied. We define the combined DSR and DI matrix approach in terms of four strategies: invention; advancement; exaptation; and exploitation and their associated DI practices. The research contribution is a novel DSR-DI matrix process model. This model extends entrepreneurship theory as it enriches effectuation thinking with more detailed process guidance for ambidextrous entrepreneurship and it enriches DSR models for DI by showing more explicitly the different pathways corresponding to different quadrants in the knowledge-innovation matrix.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.im.2020.103350,WOS,Journal

Taking the convergence of manufacturing and producer services in China as the research object, this study explored how industrial convergence affects regional green development efficiency (GDE). First, a coupling evaluation system was established to measure industrial convergence degree, and the directional distance function-based slacks-based measure was combined with the global Malmquist-Luenberger index to measure GDE. Second, we employed spatial econometric models to analyze the relationship between industrial convergence and GDE. Then, using the spatial conditional process analysis, a unified framework of green innovation, investment structure, and energy intensity was constructed to investigate the transmission mechanism involved. The results showed that: (1) Regional GDE and green innovation had a spatial dependence. (2) Considering the spatial correlation, industrial convergence is conductive to regional GDE. (3) Green innovation is an effective path by which industrial convergence improves regional GDE. (4) In this mediating process, the investment structure and energy intensity play a moderating role. The investment bias in high-tech industries increases the role of industrial convergence in promoting regional GDE and green innovation, while the moderating direction of energy intensity is opposite. In addition, there is a crowding-out effect in energy dependence, which hinders the effectiveness of green innovation.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113738,WOS,Journal

These relationships are explored in the context of Africa, where, paradoxically, firms selling abroad must satisfy different market demands than firms that serve only domestic markets. Design/methodology/approach The authors draw on the World Bank Enterprise Survey to perform a cross-sectional analysis of 4,683 manufacturing firms. These surveys cover the period 2009-2017 and 35 different African countries. The authors define service competence development as co-location with knowledge-intensive business service (KIBS) firms, measured through KIBS density at city level. Signaling is measured through outward-looking competences. Findings This paper shows that African exporters differ significantly from their non-exporting counterparts in terms of productivity and competences. External service competence generates productivity gains for exporters but has the opposite effect for non-exporters. Results consistent with previous research also show that signaling competences generate productivity gains, but the effect for firms serving domestic markets is stronger than the effect for exporting firms. The authors use paradoxes of learning to interpret these results. Originality/value The study develops a novel empirical approach to analyzing firm competences in Africa. It also shows that contextualization of existing knowledge management theories matters, opening a research avenue to test further existing theories in emerging economies.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JKM-07-2018-0433,WOS,Journal

This was done through a National Action Plan called Ecophyto which is the French response to the EU Framework Directive on the sustainable use of PPPs. The change in crop protection, required to meet the ambitious goal of Ecophyto, has generated three major research needs: first, exploration of new fields of knowledge (e.g., links between cropping systems, biodiversity and pest regulation), second, support of the unprecedented devices (e.g., pest monitoring system and farm network) put in place to accompany the transition phase, and third, reconsideration of issues related to pest management methods in the context of the changes of farming practices promoted by Ecophyto. To address these new research needs, Ecophyto has devoted a specific research and innovation (R&I) axis which prioritized relevant research questions covering eight thematic areas: (i) pest monitoring and decision-making, (ii) design of IPM solutions, (iii) diversification of pest control methods, (iv) durability and sustainability of these methods, (v) socio-economic aspects of the transition toward a low-input crop protection system, (vi) contribution of public policy for such a transition, (vii) development of indicators to assess the use and impacts of chemical PPPs, and (viii) effects on human health due to exposure to chemical PPPs. The resulting scientific program was disseminated through a diversity of calls for proposals which vastly mobilized public research, in partnership with agricultural experimentation networks and private research. This initiative has translated into dynamic and significant advances made by research which, in part, are already discernible. It will eventually produce a corpus of scientific knowledge and technical innovations which can contribute to the expected transition toward a low-input crop protection system, as long as farmers are associated in the design of sustainable IPM solutions and other concerned stakeholders of the sociotechnical system are mobilized.

It is not enough to struggle for economic development; this development and innovation that supports it must have in due count people happiness and ecological restrictions. Given the global pressure on innovation capabilities and sustainability of ecosystems, many studies try to measure the economic development of countries, linking it to investment in Intellectual Capital. In this context, intangible assets management and, specifically, Intellectual Capital (IC) and Knowledge Management (KM), became generally acknowledged Innovation factors. This chapter is about the possible causal relations between the concepts National Intellectual Capital (NIC), Innovation (INOV), Competitivity (COMP) and Sustainability (SUST). Seeing IC as a creative potential for new ideas and concepts, it is generally believed that Innovation, being the potential of transformation of new ideas and concepts into real products and services, is strongly influenced (caused) by IC: after all, the innovation must be preceded by the idea. In the same way, the efficiency of transformation of new ideas into products seems to heavily depend on new ideas related with industrial production, work organization and management, which seems to justify the notion that it makes sense to assume causal effects between IC and INOV and IC and COMP. Although IC, INOV and COMP have specific pathways in each country, it makes also sense to assume that all these variables affect, negatively or positively, the wellbeing of future generations. This chapter is a quantitative research on the validity of these theoretical hypotheses. Having this target in mind, an exploratory model for those relations was built and estimated using observational available open data from international sources for each one off the mentioned variables. The main supporting methodologies employed were descriptive multivariate data analysis techniques and PLS path modelling. In terms of originality, this empirical study aims to contribute to stimulate the emergence of data driven discussions about the factors that determine the sustainability of countries, aiming the formulation of policies and strategic planning.

Because they are new, there is a lack of research on regulatory sandboxes; most studies have investigated legal aspects while overlooking the management perspective. To address this gap, this paper builds on incubation research studies to explore how social interactions within regulatory sandboxes influence the practices of regulators and regulatees, using social capital theory. An exploratory-abductive approach is adopted, using data collected from 16 semi-structured interviews. The findings indicate that regulator-regulatee social interactions increase the legitimacy, risk management capabilities, and knowledge of regulatory frameworks among regulatees and, as to regulators, increase their understanding of regulatory constraints and potential risks in enabling technologies, better inform them of regulatees' support needs, and offer them early access to regulatory innovations. The findings also reveal that the practices of regulators and regulatees may be negatively affected due to lowered trust and discrepancies in expectations and underlying goals.

The manufacturing technology of CMM is primarily based on the theory and practices of chemical engineering in which the upgrade of its separation technology mainly relies on the advancement in chemical engineering. Our authors have been exploring and implementing membrane technology in the green manufacturing process of CMM in the past decade. Recently, we were granted funding in the topic of ""The Modernization of Traditional Chinese Medicine"" from The National Key Research and Development Program of China. In the research proposal, we introduced the emerging concept of ""material-chemistry engineering"", and suggested the concept of theoretical framework for ""the process design and engineering of membrane-based green manufacturing of CMM"". The framework included the establishment of analytical testing approach for precise analysis in aqueous CMM environment, a systematic testing and inspection method for the membrane and membrane process to guarantee the safety and effectiveness of the CMM products, as well as the integrated membrane process design and optimization for the CMM manufacturing process. The ultimate goal of the proposal is to achieve high flux and decent separation efficiency for CMM production in multi-scale range, in particular to understand the correlation between the aqueous CMM environment and the structure, property and preparation of the membrane. Furthermore, with the aid of computational modeling in process design and manufacturing, the theoretical foundation of membrane-based CMM green manufacturing can be assured. The innovation in the interdisciplinary of CMM production and material-chemistry engineering will help overcoming the current bottleneck encountered in the CMM manufacturing industry in China, resolving the urgent issues of energy, resources and environment, and providing a feasible solution to sustainable development.

Using a longitudinal mixed methods design, this article explores the inter-regional collaboration of triple helix partners from four non-contiguous European regions (Bucharest-Ilfov, Romania; Central Hungary, Hungary; Castilla-La Mancha, Spain; and South East, Ireland) which worked together to develop an inter-regional innovation system. The results from the study identified three non-spatial forms of proximity (social, cognitive and organisational) that were key determinants for developing the successful inter- regional innovation collaboration studied in this research. Based on the findings derived from this research, an inter-regional innovation system framework was developed to facilitate collaboration between stakeholders based in non-contiguous regions without them having to depend on geographical proximity. The major contributions of this research to theory and practice are the development of a novel framework for inter-regional innovation systems (iRIS) which can be applied by stakeholders in regions that want to collaborate from a distance. Furthermore, the research suggests that the substitution mechanism of geographical proximity consists of not just one non-spatial form, but it consists of the three non-spatial forms identified in this research.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/21971927-BJA10024,WOS,Journal

For instance, the real-time detection of water pollution through the deployment of novel sensors can mitigate contamination problems before they become widespread. While these tools open up new forms of water security, they simultaneously create new forms of vulnerability as the connectivity and digitalisation of these infrastructures create remote pathways to control water system behaviours. The cyber-warfare capabilities of state and non-state actors are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and attacks have successfully infiltrated water systems with worrying potential. Indeed, in 2018, the US Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigations highlighted the threat of cyber-attacks from hostile countries on water systems, demonstrating the very real nature of these threats. This paper assesses the vulnerabilities arising from increasing interconnectivity and digitalisation in water infrastructures, paying particular attention to demographics at risk of insecurity. The paper starts by reviewing cyber-warfare practices relating to infrastructure, including their increasing frequency and sophistication. This is overlaid with a current demographic understanding of water insecurity and potential vulnerabilities to cyber-attack to identify what intersectionalities appear as new threats emerge. The paper then explores the necessary structure and value of ethical impact assessments in the design of innovative technology and practices in the water sector. In order to foster sensitivity to vulnerabilities and create avenues for incorporating scalable preventative and mitigating measures into design, a practical framework (in the form of a list of questions) is outlined. This paper finds that our understanding of water insecurity must adapt to the challenges posed by cyber-attacks. Sensitivity to the existence of these threats must be fostered and a practical framework developed to attune stakeholders to cyber-threats and assist those engaged with new technologies in the water sector.

Using a longitudinal mixed methods design, this article explores the inter-regional collaboration of triple helix partners from four non-contiguous European regions (Bucharest-Ilfov, Romania; Central Hungary, Hungary; Castilla-La Mancha, Spain; and South East, Ireland) which worked together to develop an inter-regional innovation system. The results from the study identified three non-spatial forms of proximity (social, cognitive and organisational) that were key determinants for developing the successful inter- regional innovation collaboration studied in this research. Based on the findings derived from this research, an inter-regional innovation system framework was developed to facilitate collaboration between stakeholders based in non-contiguous regions without them having to depend on geographical proximity. The major contributions of this research to theory and practice are the development of a novel framework for inter-regional innovation systems (iRIS) which can be applied by stakeholders in regions that want to collaborate from a distance. Furthermore, the research suggests that the substitution mechanism of geographical proximity consists of not just one non-spatial form, but it consists of the three non-spatial forms identified in this research.

Materials and Methods: We assessed PHD's impact and value in 2 ways. First, we analyzed publication impact by calculating a PHD h-index and characterizing the professional domains of citing journals. Next, we surveyed and interviewed PHD grantees, expert consultants, and codirectors to assess the program's components and the potential future application of design thinking to artificial intelligence (AI) integration into healthcare. Results: There was a total of 1171 unique citations to PHD-funded work (collective h-index of 25). Studies citing PHD span medical, legal, and computational journals. Participants stated that this project transformed their thinking, altered their career trajectory, and resulted in technology transfer into the commercial sector. Participants felt, in general, that the approach would be valuable in solving contemporary challenges integrating AI in healthcare including complex social questions, integrating knowledge from multiple domains, implementation, and governance. Conclusion: Design thinking is a systematic approach to problem-solving characterized by cooperation and collaboration. PHD generated significant impacts as measured by citations, reach, and overall effect on participants. PHD's design thinking methods are potentially useful to other work on cyber-physical systems, such as the use of AI in healthcare, to propose structural or policy-related changes that may affect adoption, value, and improvement of the care delivery system.

Following the existing literature on risks and intellectual property (IP) risks, we define patent risks as the lack of understanding of the distribution of patents that lead to losing a key patent, increased research and development costs, and, potentially, infringement litigation. This paper aims to propose an explorative approach to investigating patent risks in the target technology field by integrating social network analysis and patent analysis. Compared to previous research, this study makes an important contribution toward identifying patent risks in the overall technological field by employing a patent-based multi-level network model that has not appeared in existing methodologies of patent risks. In order to verify the effectiveness of this approach, we take artificial intelligence (AI) as an example. Data collected from the Derwent Innovation Index (DII) database were used to build the patent-based multi-level network on patent risks from market, technology, and assignee perspectives. The results indicate that the lack of international collaborations among assignees and industry-university-research collaboration may lead to patent collaboration risks. Regarding patent market risks, the lack of overseas patent applications, especially the lack of distribution in the main competitive markets, is a key factor. As for patent technology risks, most of the leading assignees lack awareness of the distribution in the following technological fields: industrial electric equipment, engineering instrumentation, and automotive electrics. In summary, assignees from the U.S. with first mover advantages are still powerful leaders in the AI technology field. Although China is catching up very rapidly in the total number of AI patents, the apparent patent risks under the perspectives of collaboration, market, and technology will obviously hamper the catch-up efforts of China's AI industry. We conclude that, in practice, the proposed patent-based multi-level network model not only plays an important role in helping stakeholders in the AI technological field to prevent patent risks, find new technology opportunities, and obtain sustainable development, but also has significance for guiding the industrial development of various emerging technology fields.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12208667,WOS,Journal

(2016),Towards a scholarship of integration: Lessons from four cases,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",,,"The purpose of this theory paper is to illustrate possible approaches to the scholarship of integration and explore features, challenges and outcomes of these approaches. Among the forms of scholarship - i.e., discovery, teaching and learning, integration, and application - the scholarship of integration emphasizes bringing together otherwise isolated knowledge by making generative connections within and across different perspectives and disciplines. These connections lead to new insights and language, and place specialized knowledge in a broader context, often revealing patterns that can be useful to specialists and non-specialists. Some argue that this form of scholarship is becoming more central to academic work because it is better equipped for building interdisciplinary partnerships, developing frameworks that transcend disciplinary paradigms, and responding to complex issues at the individual and societal level. For engineering education, this type of scholarship can provide a mechanism for scholars to create new language, theorize and develop conceptual frameworks, and make cross-disciplinary translations for use in discovery, teaching, and practice. Yet, although valuable, the scholarship of integration is relatively underdeveloped and under-theorized. In this paper, we unpack four scholarship of integration cases - focused on systems thinking, innovation, design teaching and learning, and reflection - with a goal of enhancing our collective understanding of this form of scholarship and ways to use it in engineering education. We employ a process of collaborative inquiry to reflect upon, analyze, and highlight common strategies and challenges in each of and across our cases. First, we provide individual accounts of our experiences, lessons learned, and scholarship of integration features, revealed through our collaborative process, that are embedded in our cases. We then highlight a common strategy and three common challenges that emerged through the collaborative inquiry process. We conclude with a question about the implications of this exploration for individual researchers, the community, and policy makers that warrant further conversation.

Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected by the paired method from 56 Chinese companiesâ€™ R&D teams, which comprised 356 valid samples. Besides, structure equitation modeling and hierarchical linear modeling were used to test the hypotheses. Findings: Team knowledge territoriality had a significant positive impact on individual idea generation, team information exchange and team idea implementation. Team information exchange mediated the relationship between team knowledge territoriality and team idea implementation. Moreover, team information exchange positively moderated the relationship between team knowledge territoriality and individual idea generation. Furthermore, the relationship between individual idea generation and team idea implementation was mediated by team trust. Originality/value: This study augments the theoretical research of territoriality and innovation process. From the viewpoint of knowledge territoriality to describe the coexistence of knowledge sharing and knowledge hiding in the organization, this study reveals the influence mechanism of team knowledge territoriality on team innovation process. Overall, this study provides empirical support that team territoriality can weaken the adverse impact of individual territoriality on innovation to a certain extent.

The influential role of agency and the manner in which formal mechanisms established to manage engagement impact upon policy analysis and transfer are explored. The analysis finds that agency mobilised with the supplementation of institutional resources becomes a highly motivating and powerful force underpinning collaborative policy transfer processes. The nuances and challenges of policy transfer from a predominantly neoliberal administrative domain into a characteristically corporatist environment are analysed demonstrating that domestic policy processes are critical for defining avenues for actor participation and the manner through which policy adjustments are progressed. A key finding of the work is that policy transfer is more than the one-way transmission of ideas, systems and practices from one jurisdiction to another but can also act as an iterative process, more evidently linked into each jurisdictions' domestic policy cycles of problem analysis, action and review. Under collaborative policy transfer the resources and interest from two distinct locations are mobilised around a policy concern and this effectively enhances the level of critical thinking and reflective practice that contributes to problem solving and solution development. The findings of this study confirm that cross-country collaboration and transfer is an increasingly important pathway in the ongoing development of policy reform and innovation.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0952076718754617,WOS,Journal

However, these benefits are unlikely to be realised if the social implications of these technological innovations are not adequately considered by those who promote them. Big Data applications are intrinsically socio-technical; their development and deployment are a product of social interactions between people, institutional and regulatory settings, as well as the technology itself. This paper explores the socio-technical factors and conditions that influence the development of Smart Farming and Big Data applications, using a multi-level perspective on transitions combined with social practice theory. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 26 Australian grain farmers and industry stakeholders to elicit their perspectives on benefits and risks of these changes. The analysis shows that issues related to trust are central concerns for many participants. These include procedural concerns about transparency and distributional concerns about who will benefit from access to and use of farmers' data. These concerns create scepticism about the value of `smart' technologies amongst some industry stakeholders, especially farmers. It also points to a divergence of expectations and norms between actors and institutions at the regime and niche levels in the emerging transition towards Smart Farming. Bridging this divide will require niche level interventions to enhance the agency of farmers and their local networks in these transactions, and, the cooperative design of new institutions at regime level to facilitate the fair and transparent allocation of risk and benefit in farming data information chains.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.njas.2018.11.002,WOS,Journal

Knowledge sharing refers to the process by which individuals transfer information and thereby spread innovative ideas within an organization. We use knowledge sharing as a lens for identifying factors that encourage productive teaching-related conversations between individuals, characterizing the context and content of these discussions, and understanding how peer interactions may shape instructional practices. In this study, we interview 19 science faculty using innovative teaching practices about the teaching-focused conversations they have with different discussion partners. Results: This qualitative study describes characteristics of the relationship between discussion partners, what they discuss with respect to teaching, the amount of help-seeking that occurs, and the perceived impacts of these conversations on their teaching. We highlight the role of office location and course overlap in bringing faculty together and characterize the range of topics they discuss, such as course delivery and teaching strategies. We note the tendency of faculty to seek out partners with relevant expertise and describe how faculty perceive their discussion partners to influence their instructional practices and personal affect. Finally, we elaborate on how these themes vary depending on the relationship between discussion partners. Conclusions: The knowledge sharing framework provides a useful lens for investigatingÂ how various factors affectÂ faculty conversationsÂ around teaching. Building on this framework, our results lead us to propose two hypotheses for how to promote sharing teaching knowledge among faculty, thereby identifying productive directions for further systematic inquiry.Â In particular, we propose that productive teaching conversations might be cultivated by fostering collaborative teaching partnerships and developing departmental structures to facilitate sharing of teaching expertise.Â We further suggest that social network theories and other examinations of faculty behavior can be useful approaches for researching the mechanisms that drive teaching reform.

(2020),A choice behavior experiment with circular business models using machine learning and simulation modeling,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,,10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.120894,"Background: Transitions from a linear (take-make-dispose) to a circular product system (considering reuse/remanufacturing/recycling) require changes of business models through new value propositions. Therefore, the focus for industrial businesses shifts from selling physical products to, for example, providing access to functionality through business innovation. In this context it is particularly challenging to understand what complexity a new concept like circular economy (CE) brings to established businesses where the success and the failure of the business is dependent on customers acceptance of new value propositions. Objective: The objective of this paper is to develop an algorithm based on gathered survey data to learn choice behavior of a small customer group and then replicate that choice behavior on a larger population level. Purpose: This paper explores the opportunities of different circular business offers in the city of Stockholm by embedding support vector machine classifiers, which are trained on CE survey data, in a simulation model to quantify and study choice behavior on city level. Method: Stated choices from CE surveys including unique demographic data from the respondents, i.e. age, income, gender and education, are used for algorithm training. Based on the survey data, support vector machine algorithms are trained to replicate the decision-making process of a small sample of respondents. The example of a washing machine is used as a case study with the attributes price and payment scheme, environmental friendliness as well as service level. The trained support vector machines are then implemented in a simulation model to simulate choice behavior on population level (Stockholm city). Originality: This paper is the first of its kind to use both machine learning and simulation approaches in a CE market acceptance context. Findings: Based on the washing machine-specific survey and Stockholm-specific customer data, results indicate that larger share of the Stockholm population would be willing to opt for circular washing machine offers compared to the existing linear sales model. Given the data-driven nature of machine learning algorithms and the process-oriented structure of simulations programs allows for generating large amounts of data from small samples. This supports exploration of new emerging areas like CE in addition to saving time and expenses. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

They face global competition, are under-resourced, and suffer from weaker institutional support. It is suggested that to innovate successfully in this context, indigenous firms would benefit from focusing on managing their current knowledge base more efficiently. We know little about how knowledge management works outside developed economies and which knowledge governance mechanisms have more influence than others in the context of emerging economies. To address this gap, we explore how context may matter for the use of knowledge governance mechanisms and their effect on innovation performance in Brazilian firms. Using the survey data of 109 firms, structural equation modelling, and cluster analysis, our findings suggest that the joint application of knowledge-focused rewards, organizational design, and information and communication technologies that support knowledge processes is critical for boosting innovation performance. We discuss how the peculiarities of the Brazilian context may shape these findings. Our article contributes to the knowledge management and innovation literature by demonstrating that the joint effects of bundles of knowledge governance mechanisms and contextual variables should be explored in order to understand their impact on organizational outcomes.

Against this background, this paper aims to explore how the temporal dimension have influenced market competition, power and interpretation, and the dynamics of electricity systems in a welfare state by examining Japan as a case study. Our conclusions are as follows. First, periods of possessing and exercising power are important, both in terms of reinforcing the current infrasystem and in moving it toward a sustainable pathway. The longer that incumbents and their alliance possess and exercise power, the deeper that infrasystems can be embedded into society and the narrower the space created by landscape pressures becomes for developing niche innovators. Second, long time dominance of incumbents and its alliance in power enables them to capitalize on landscape pressures to reinforce them, realigning the currently unsustainable electricity system while to prevent niche innovations from sufficiently developed as reliable alternatives. Third, long time dominance can change the extent of feedback effects in policy instruments and institutional reform, weakening driving force for transition to sustainability.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2017.05.003,WOS,Journal

Modern methods of construction (MMC) are put forward as a solution to ensure quicker, safer, and greener delivery of new homes and are supported by the government, especially in the social housing sector. The paper explores the post-occupancy evaluation mechanisms used by housing associations delivering homes with traditional and MMC approaches. It argues that, alongside the digital and offsite transformation of housebuilding, the industry needs to reconsider the way customer feedback is collected and what purposes it serves. The paper argues that UK housebuilding in the social housing sector can benefit from re-purposing post-occupancy evaluation (POE) from only measuring customer satisfaction and detecting defects, which is currently the case, to using it to improve housing design and construction quality. This could be done by developing a systematic learning loop from residents of previous projects to the design, development, and construction teams across the housebuilding supply chain. It could particularly benefit housing associations pioneering MMC that, as long-term asset holders of developed houses, have a vested interest in improving the quality of homes and creating a better residential experience. The accumulated knowledge of such customer-centred approaches could also inform MMC technology development and help increase its uptake. However, as the paper further discusses, there are many challenges on the way to effective POE in social housing provision, including the nature of the MMC-based housebuilding supply chain and the industry's structural factors.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01446193.2022.2111694,WOS,Journal

Previous studies have not examined the temporary group context when conducting research on creativity. Drawing on the social cognitive theory and the actor-partner interdependence model (APIM) approach, this study explored two questions related to how psychological cognitive factors (i.e., intrinsic motivation and creative self-efficacy) motivate creativity, and whether the motivation process is influenced by others. Using a class experiment and a pre and posttest questionnaire survey completed by civil engineering students that performed an idea generation task, this study applies an APIM approach to distinguish the positive actor effects of students' innovation motivation and task motivation on their own creativity, instead of the negative or nonsignificant influences from a partner. Creative self-efficacy-as a mediator-plays an indirect positive actor role between students' intrinsic motivation and their own creativity, but an indirect negative partner role in affecting partners' creativity. The findings contribute to an in-depth understanding of the componential model of creativity, including the creative source of intrinsic motivation and the motivational path from interest to belief. The study also provides a broader interdependence perspective to motivate an individual's creativity in engineering and educational practice.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)EI.2643-9115.0000003,WOS,Journal

The project is novel in that it explores a transdisciplinary approach of supporting STEAM education in a school, using data science and an Internet of Things (IoT) based Environment Monitoring System. This case study contributes to an emerging field of research within STEAM that is informed by practice with emphasis placed on the value of collaboration and transdisciplinary pedagogical approaches. The multi collaborators included lecturers from a college of education with expertise in STEM and Visual Arts education, creative professionals (artists, scientists, and architects), teachers, students, and children. Encompassing all the mentioned stakeholders was important and placed transdisciplinarity at the core of the learning. Qualitative data was collected using questionnaires, focus groups and interviews to research how the participants interpreted their experiences and what meaning they attributed to their experiences. It was found that a program of STEAM education integrating new and emerging technologies with data science and the IoT can promote and encourage the delivery of a transdisciplinary model of STEAM education and the overall reconceptualization of how individual subject areas are taught at elementary level. Innovative data capturing technologies, exploring real-life data within their local educational contexts can positively impact children and teachers' knowledge and skills in STEAM supporting the development of artistic concepts, engineering habits of mind, imagination, and creativity.

Thus, using a knowledge-based view theory, this study aims to determine the relationship between EL and ES, mediated through KMPs. In addition, for a better understanding, the study also used KE as a moderator. A quantitative survey method has been employed to collect data from 390 entrepreneurial venture (EV) owners, co-founders, and managers in tech-oriented ventures (IT and Software-based) operating in Pakistan. Smart partial least squares (PLS) statistical software was used to analyze the impact mechanism of EL on ES through the structural equation model. The findings revealed that EL style positively influences ES. In addition, KMPs fully mediate the relationship between EL and ES.

Several of the challenges of combining these technologies are identified, and potential solutions are developed. Design/methodology/approach-An experimental approach is taken to investigate some of the relevant physical processes for integrating FDM and inkjet deposition, including the printing, drying and sintering processes. Experimental data are collected to assist understanding of the problems, and engineering solutions are proposed and implemented based on the gained understanding of the problems. Findings-Three challenges have been identified, including the discontinuity of the printed lines resulting from the irregular surface of the FDM substrate, the non-conductivity of the printed lines due to the particle segregation during the droplet drying process and the slow drying process caused by the ""skinning effect"". Two engineering solutions are developed for the discontinuity problem. The non-conductivity issue and the slow drying process are attributed to the motion of the nanoparticles caused by the evaporation flow. The thermally activated drying process for the Cabot ink suggests that the proposed solution is effective. Timescale analysis and experimental data show that the printing conditions do not have a clear influence on the conductivity of the printed lines, and drying and sintering processes are more important. rarch limitations/implications-No quantitative model has yet been developed for simulating the printing, drying and sintering processes sociated with inkjet printing on FDM substrates. Quantitative models can be extremely valuable for improvement in understanding the problems, optimizing the proposed solutions and coming up with better solutions. Practical implications-The research findings in this work have great implications in implementing a hybrid FDM-inkjet deposition machine for fabricating embedded electronics and smart structures. All the proposed engineering solutions for the identified problems can be potentially integrated into one machine. Social implications-The success of the integration of the FDM and inkjet deposition process will enable the design of compact electro-mechanical structures to replace the large heavy electro-mechanical systems. Originality/value-This work represents one of the first attempts for integrating inkjet deposition of silver nanoparticle inks with the FDM process for making compact electro-mechanical structures. Three critical challenges are identified, and corresponding engineering solutions are proposed and implemented based on analysis of the relevant physical processes, including the printing, drying and sintering processes, which has laid the foundation for integrating the FDM and inkjet deposition processes.

This study used questionnaire survey method to understand user data and used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze the relationship of various dimensions. The results showed that understanding information security awareness and customer alienation through AI technology has a positive impact on consumersâ€™ privacy concerns. Through privacy management, consumers can indeed reduce their doubts about privacy leakage. Customer privacy concerns and customer calibration have positive and significant effects on privacy management and self-disclosure, respectively.

Conventional means, such as questionnaire, survey and self-report with predefined questions and prompts, are used to collect information about usersâ€™ experience during various UX studies. However, such data is often limited and restricted by initial setups, and they won't easily allow designers to identify all critical elements such as user profile, context, related product features, etc. Meanwhile, with widely accessible social media, the volume and velocity of customer-generated data are fast-increasing. While it is generally acknowledged that such data contains important elements in understanding and analyzing UX, extracting them to assist product design remains a challenging issue. In this study, how UX data underlying product design can be isolated and restored from customer online reviews is examined. A faceted conceptual model is proposed to elucidate the crucial factors of UX, which serves as an operational mechanism connecting to product design. A methodology of establishing a UX knowledge base from customer online reviews is then proposed to support UX-centered design activities, which consists of three stages, i.e., UX discovery to extract UX data from a single review, UX data integration to group similar data and UX network formalization to build up the causal dependencies among UX groups. Using a case study on smart mobile phone reviews, examples of UX data discovered are demonstrated and both customers and designers concerned key product features and usage situations are exemplified. This study explores the feasibility to discover valuable UX data as well as their relations automatically for product design and business strategic plan by analyzing a large volume of customer online data.

(2020),Simulation optimisation towards energy efficient green buildings: Current status and future trends,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,,10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.120012,"The increasing global importance of climate change has been clearly recognised in the last few years. The building industry contributed to a large proportion of the global energy use and carbon emissions across material production, construction, operation and end-of-life. Utilizing computer simulation and optimisation to minimize the building life cycle environmental impacts has gained increasing attentions recently. There were researches on different kinds of computational optimisation in various contexts, but a critical review to identify and compare the optimisation approaches is still lacking and needed to demonstrate their strengths/weaknesses and to highlight the future research challenges. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to critically review the computer simulation and optimisation studies for minimizing the life cycle energy consumption and carbon emissions in buildings, with the aim of identifying the current practices and future research need in this field. The common research streams and methods (e.g., innovative structural systems and materials, energy retrofitting measures) were compared, with an in-depth analysis on the importance and benefits that come with their usages. Life cycle design optimisation with the consideration of production, operation and end-of-life of building systems has a growing importance for the sustainable development of the future towards resource-based circular economy. Moreover, emerging digital technologies (such as machine learning, data-driven design, and parametric 3D modelling) enable greater automation in early design exploration and advance decision marking in design optimisation. As human factors (e.g., energy-related occupant behaviours) become important metrics in the built environment, multi-disciplinary design should be adopted to generate social-technical solutions that encompass both environmental sustainability and human wellbeing.

(2022),Participatory Methods for Systems Modeling of Youth Mental Health: Implementation Protocol,JMIR Research Protocols,Co-design; Mental health services; Participatory system modeling; Public health systems research; Youth mental health,10.2196/32988,"Background: Despite significant investment, mental health issues remain a leading cause of death among young people globally. Sophisticated decision analysis methods are needed to better understand the dynamic and multisector drivers of youth mental health. System modeling can help explore complex issues such as youth mental health and inform strategies to effectively respond to local needs and achieve lasting improvements. The advantages of engaging stakeholders in model development processes have long been recognized; however, the methods for doing so are often not well-described. Objective: This paper aims to describe the participatory procedures that will be used to support systems modeling for national multisite implementation. The Right Care, First Time, Where You Live research program will focus on regional youth mental health applications of systems modeling in 8 different sites across Australia. Methods: The participatory model development approach involves an iterative process of engaging with a range of participants, including people with lived experience of mental health issues. Their knowledge of the local systems, pathways, and drivers is combined with the academic literature and data to populate the models and validate their structure. The process centers around 3 workshops where participants interact and actively engage in group model-building activities to define, refine, and validate the systems models. This paper provides a detailed blueprint for the implementation of this process for mental health applications. Results: The participatory modeling methods described in this paper will be implemented at 2 sites per year from 2022 to 2025. The 8 selected sites have been chosen to capture variations in important factors, including determinants of mental health issues and access to services. Site engagement commenced in August 2021, and the first modeling workshops are scheduled to commence in February 2022. Conclusions: Mental health system decision makers require tools to help navigate complex environments and leverage interdisciplinary problem-solving. Systems modeling can mobilize data from diverse sources to explore a range of scenarios, including the impact of interventions in different combinations and contexts. Involving stakeholders in the model development process ensures that the model findings are context-relevant and fit-for-purpose to inform decision-making.

This research analyses how ERP and BMI are related and, in turn, what is the final the impact on organizational performance. Design/methodology/approach The sample consisted on 104 organizations from different industries, all of which used an ERP software. A structural equation model was used to test the six hypotheses. Findings The results indicate that the BMI constructs considered (i.e. value-generation and organizational complexity) mediate the impact of the ERP constructs (organizational adaptation and organizational resistance), in organizational performance. Successful ERP implementation is not an end itself for this companies, but merely a path and a process for improving the business model with the aim improving performance in the marketplace. Research limitations/implications This study offers a new outlook on how a company should leverage the ERP adaptation, and any resistance in the organization to innovating in the business model. This study is rooted in the evolutionary perspective of BMI, but it also integrates into an overall model other points of view such as the rational positioning view and cognitive view. Practical implications Organizations must understand the ERP flows in depth, each ERP flow is the work result of a multitude of companies over several years. All departments, and in particular the research and development department must participate actively in the ERP implementation. Organised complexity means opportunities for success in the market. Organizations must train their departments in ERP and not just teach them how the ERP works. ERP implementation needs consider improvements to the business model and ultimately the performance, but not separately. Originality/value BMI has received contributions from several domains such as entrepreneurship, management organization and strategic management among others. Nonetheless, the role of ERP in BMI is far from being understood and the few contributions focus only on technologyper se. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study that has explored the connections of ERP and BMI and in turn the final outcome in organizational performance.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EJIM-04-2019-0092,WOS,Journal

(2022),Integrating gender and farmer's preferences in a discussion support tool for crop choice,AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS,,10.1016/j.agsy.2021.103300,"CONTEXT: In northern West Bengal and southern Bangladesh, Rabi crops, sown in winter and harvested in the spring, are an important source of income and nutrition for the target communities. In the study areas, NGOs and extension services have been engaging with farming communities on selecting suitable crops for the upcoming season. This engagement took place in the absence of quantitative tools to discuss trade offs and what-if scenarios to support an informed discussion. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to design a crop-choice model to support extension agronomists in engaging with the farming communities more effectively using a quantitative analysis tool. In this process, we explored how agricultural system models can be inclusive and allow participation and eventual application by NGO and government extension agents, using a process of gender sensitive contribution. Methods: The crop-choice model includes several constraints related to available resources, including land, labour, capital and technologies to calculate optimal crop areas within the Rabi season. The crop choices are determined considering gender specific community perceptions of risks, labour use, market, price-volatility, self consumption, water use and cash flow. The model was used to explore the consequences of different crop choices on income, gender specific labour, use of inputs and markets, and to reveal the trade-offs of pursuing different crop choice pathways in the context of agricultural intensification. The initial model was demonstrated to the farmers and the extension agents, and based on their reflections, it was fine-tuned further to make the engagement process more effective. For better communication with the participating farmers, the model related questions and findings were translated in the local language (Bengali). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We found that the modelling process can be made more inclusive from the outset by including farmers, NGO and extension agents as co-contributors of the model at each of the modelling steps and incorporating their reflections. Such an inclusive and reflective approach provides easy-to-use interfaces and enables translation of model results in ways that more effectively benefit farming communities. The process of engagement with farmers during tool development has been very valuable to farmers and researchers alike and the use of the tool has made the farmers informed about alternative scenarios and led to actual benefits for crop choice decision making. Inclusive farming systems models need to consider the gender dimension and its critical role in farm decision making and how this can be included in models to reflect the diversity of decision process. To maximise relevance of the model for next users and farmers, it was important that these key stakeholders were part of the model development from the beginning, this study has focused on the same throughout. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrated that appropriate design and development principles enabled bioeconomic farming systems models to be used by NGO and government extension agents to engage with farming communities as discussion support tools in farming decisions. Such an approach would make the engagement process more convincing and effective. Besides, it would also provide useful insights to the NGO and extension agents in revising their intervention strategies.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2021.103300,WOS,Journal

This study observes two knowledge gaps in the quest for SPI success and proposes a research model that integrates existing knowledge antecedents to address these gaps. Based on organizational learning theory and the dynamic capability view, the proposed model consolidates a firm's absorptive capacity (AC), learning ability in terms of exploration and exploitation and knowledge sharing (KS), and it examines the contextual relationships among these knowledge antecedents on the path to SPI success. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative research design is implemented to examine the model with a sample of 138 SPI-certified organizations in Taiwan and Mainland China. The partial least squares (PLS) technique is used for the data analysis. Findings The results reveal the following findings. First, AC triggers the effect of exploration/exploitation on SPI success. Second, KS fosters exploitation but has an insignificant influence on exploration. Third, KS can promote AC, and it serves as the sourcing mechanism for all of the knowledge antecedents. Overall, an integrative set of knowledge learning routes is presented in guiding software firms on the way to SPI success.

With the advancement of network technology and the onset of the information age, an increasing number of students have lost interest in traditional English reading and writing instruction in the classroom. Flipped classrooms have emerged as a result of this situation and have become the focus of research in one fell swoop. As a result, flipped classroom research at home and abroad has primarily focused on the theory and practical application of flipped classrooms, and flipped classroom application practice is primarily based on the overall classroom, with few separate discussions on the effects of flipped classroom students' self-learning. As a result, we developed a recurrent neural network-based intelligent assisted learning algorithm for English flipped classrooms. There are two main characteristics of the model. First, it is a gated recurrent unit based on a variant structure of the recurrent neural network. The double-gating mechanism fully considers the context and selects memory through weight assignment, and on this basis, it integrates the novel LeakyReLU function to improve the model's training convergence efficiency. Second, by overcoming time-consuming problems in the medium, the adoption of the connection sequence classification algorithm eliminates the need for prior alignment of speech and text data, resulting in a direct boost in model training speed. The experimental results show that in the English flipped classroom's intelligent learning mode, students explore and discover knowledge independently, their enthusiasm and interest in learning are greatly increased, and the flipped classroom's teaching effect is greatly improved.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/8020461,WOS,Journal

Their peoples are also among the first to be widely affected by global changes such as land degradation and climate change. Yet drylands are a source of many social and technical innovations, globally, as well as in Australia. As a major developed dryland nation, Australia has previously played a major role in extending these innovations to the rest of the world. The nation has reaped reputational and commercial benefits through major research and practice contributions to dryland agriculture, water management and governance, remote area services, indigenous partnerships, dryland monitoring systems, and 'desert knowledge' innovation. Australian researchers continue to contribute to various relevant international processes, yet recognition and support for this within Australia has dropped off markedly in recent years. We analyse the Australian government's investment in research and in overseas aid for drylands over the last two decades, and explore trends in government's active involvement in major international processes related to land. These trends are short-sighted, overlooking potential economic benefits for Australian enterprises, and undermining Australia's stance and scientific leadership in dryland systems globally. In this commentary, we argue that it is time for the trends to be reversed, as this is an area of comparative advantage for Australian diplomacy with significant returns on investment for Australia, both direct and indirect, especially when most emerging economies contain substantial drylands. We identify four major pathways to obtaining benefits from science diplomacy, and four interrelated actions within Australia to enable these - to place a higher emphasis on science diplomacy, to re-forge a bipartisan recognition of Australian drylands expertise, to establish a dedicated Dryland Information Hub, and to create a network of relevant science and technology advisors.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RJ20055,WOS,Journal

(2022),System dynamics approach of knowledge transfer from projects to the project-based organization,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS,,10.1108/IJMPB-06-2021-0142,"Purpose Although knowledge transfer in the context of projects and project-based organizations (PBOs) has gained increasing attention from academia and industry, it is not clear how knowledge transfers from projects to their parent PBOs. This research aims to explore the main factors influencing knowledge transfer from projects to their parent PBOs, and analyze how these factors integrate the transfer process as system components using the system dynamics (SD) method. Design/methodology/approach Based on the literature review, investigation and interview, this paper adopts the event analysis to obtain the influencing factors from historical cases and establishes a conceptual model of knowledge transfer from five dimensions, which simultaneously considers the knowledge sender, knowledge receiver and the relationship between the knowledge sender and receiver, knowledge features and transfer context. Then, the relationships between variables in the qualitative model were clarified, and a quantitative model including seven feedback loops was established using the SD model. Lastly, the system simulation and sensitivity analysis of the main parameters were realized in Vensim PLE software. Findings The simulation analysis results show that the model can simulate the knowledge transfer process from projects to the PBO to a certain extent. This research fully demonstrates the impact of variables from five dimensions on knowledge transfer and incorporates the knowledge gap and transfer threshold in the research category. Moreover, the rationality of seven feedback loops proposed in the model was verified. And the effects of various factors on the amount of knowledge transferred and the PBO's knowledge stock were examined through sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, recommendations for developing an integrated knowledge transfer mechanism of PBOs and projects to enhance transfer effect are offered. Research limitations/implications This research provides other researchers with a systematic understanding of transfer process from projects to PBOs, and insight for further research on knowledge transfer in project and organization contexts. Furthermore, this study guides researchers to focus on the causal processes that constitute knowledge transfer and explores the expected and unexpected phenomena generated over time. However, some variables involved in the transfer process are simplified, and the establishment of a more complex dynamic model needs further research and discussion. Practical implications By establishing a simulation model for knowledge transfer from projects to their parent PBOs, this study helps project teams and PBOs grasp the overall picture of the transfer process. Especially, this paper provides target-oriented recommendations for project and PBO managers to implement effective knowledge transfer practices, which have certain practical values for knowledge cultivation, coordination, reuse and innovation in the organization. Originality/value This study contributes to knowledge management and project management literature by simulating the knowledge transfer process from projects to their parent PBOs. Additionally, this paper provides a reference for PBO and project managers to establish an integrated knowledge-transfer mechanism in the work process and comprehensively implement effective knowledge transfer practices.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJMPB-06-2021-0142,WOS,Journal

Based on the human resource management system (HRMS), organizational psychological ownership, and other related theories, the transformational leaders and their advice behavior in start-ups are taken as the research object. The data obtained from the questionnaire as the research samples. Second, the influence and intermediary effect of employees' organizational psychological ownership on colleagues, leaders, and the whole enterprise are discussed, and the corresponding conclusions are drawn. The results show that the path coefficients of transformational leaders of start-up enterprises for employees' advice to their superiors and their peers are 0.28 and 0.31, respectively, and p < 0.01. Therefore, transformational leadership has a positive impact on both elements. In the relationship between organizational psychological ownership and employee creativity, the r value is 0.34 and p < 0.01. This shows that organizational psychological ownership positively correlates with employees' creativity. In addition, corporate support can mediate employees' behavior and psychological ownership in the organization and has a positive correlation in support, identity, and care.

A case-based analysis of six innovative Italian start-ups",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURIAL BEHAVIOR & RESEARCH,,10.1108/IJEBR-12-2018-0817,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the debate on exploration-exploitation trade-off in the context of new ventures creation, where, particularly at the empirical level, there is a limited understanding of whether and how this trade-off is achieved and how start-ups performances are affected by the way in which they face the exploration-exploitation dilemma. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative case study approach has been adopted as a methodology to conduct the research. Six Italian innovative start-ups were selected and analyzed through in-depth interviews with founders and data collection to understand whether and how start-ups adopt exploration and exploitation solutions to face critical events in their business lives. Findings The most evident result of this study is that start-ups adopt more frequently a temporal separation of exploration and exploitation activities as the preferred mode for balancing learning and innovation tension. They do not seem to exhibit a defined or a common path in the way they realize the temporal separation between exploration and exploitation. Instead, they mostly oscillate. The ambidextrous solution is selected in only a few cases and not consecutively. The pre-entry knowledge profile seems to influence the choice of start-ups at the beginning of their lives. Practical implications - This research has implications for the whole start-up's ecosystem, comprising incubators/accelerators, advisors, intermediaries, venture capitalists, new venture founders and policymakers. For example, by knowing the typology of knowledge and competence gaps start-ups usually aim to fill when they face particular events, intermediaries (such as incubators) could better plan initiatives and strategies supporting new ventures in the process of growth and stabilization. Furthermore, the venture capitalists can benefit from this research, by planning specific interventions for each critical event based on specific resources and competencies gaps and guiding for more promising start-ups. Originality/value This paper presents a novel application of entrepreneurial learning approach in the context of new venture creation.

(2019),Analysis of technological knowledge stock and prediction of its future development potential: The case of lithium-ion batteries,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,,10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.03.174,"Amidst growing environmental challenges and increasing penetration of sustainable energy production, the development of efficient energy storage system (EES) is indispensable to fully benefit from the use of intermittent renewable energy sources. Although lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been the dominant energy storage technology for applications in consumer electronics, electrified transportation and stationary electricity storage, further technological progress is required for achieving the climate protection objectives. In this context, continuous exploration of new technological opportunities is favorable to advance the global energy transition towards sustainability to success. To facilitate such progress and to avoid potential technological lock-in situation, understanding the underlying latent knowledge construct revealed in patents may prove beneficial. However, previous studies have either focused on analyzing the technological improvements along a particular development path or emphasizing the necessity for improvements in environmental-economic dimensions. Accordingly, a novel patent-based analysis framework is proposed to obtain an inclusive view on the continuing path of technology development concerning the research of LIBs as well as to predict its future development potential based on two machine learning algorithms: Principal component analysis (PCA) and random forest classifier (RFC). In this study, PCA is firstly applied to group various knowledge areas into key technological knowledge stocks. Building upon these results, RFC is adopted to forecast the future developmental potential of technological knowledge areas. The findings show that the research landscape of LIBs is a dynamic environment where new knowledge stocks emerged overtime and the identified knowledge stocks within a defined time interval play an orchestrating role in the advancement of lithium-ion battery technology. In particular, knowledge stocks related to battery management system and hybrid capacitors have gained relevance. The proposed analysis framework can be used to track the past chronology of knowledge accumulation trajectory and can proactively enhance the knowledge management capabilities of experts, who wish to create a path towards a low-carbon economy.

The purpose of this study is to explore the dynamic processes and interactions by which workforce planning and development (WFPD) is evolving in this new environment. Methods: Informed by the theory of loosely coupled systems (LCS), we use a case study design to examine how workforce changes are being managed in Kaiser Permanente and Montefiore Health System. We conducted site visits with in-depth interviews with 8 to 10 stakeholders in each organization. Results: Both systems demonstrate a concern for the impact of change on their workforce and have made commitments to avoid outsourcing and layoffs. Central workforce planning mechanisms have been replaced with strategies to integrate various stakeholders and units in alignment with strategic growth plans. Features of this new approach include early and continuous engagement of labor in innovation; the development of intermediary sense-making structures to garner resources, facilitate plans, and build consensus; and a whole system perspective, rather than a focus on single professions. We also identify seven principles underlying the WFPD processes in these two cases that can aid in development of a new and more adaptive workforce strategy in healthcare. Conclusions: Since passage of the ACA, healthcare systems are becoming larger and more complex. Insights from these case studies suggest that while organizational history and structure determined different areas of emphasis, our results indicate that large-scale system transformations in healthcare can be managed in ways that enhance the skills and capacities of the workforce. Our findings merit attention, not just by healthcare administrators and union leaders, but by policymakers and scholars interested in making WFPD policies at a state and national level more responsive.

(2021),Promoting inter-organisational knowledge sharing: A qualitative evaluation of England's Global Digital Exemplar and Fast Follower Programme,PLoS ONE,,10.1371/journal.pone.0255220,"Background The Global Digital Exemplar (GDE) Programme was designed to promote the digitisation of hospital services in England. Selected provider organisations that were reasonably digitallymature were funded with the expectation that they would achieve internationally recognised levels of excellence and act as exemplars ('GDE sites') and share their learning with somewhat less digitally-mature Fast Follower (FF) sites. Aims This paper explores how partnerships between GDE and FF sites have promoted knowledge sharing and learning between organisations. Methods We conducted an independent qualitative longitudinal evaluation of the GDE Programme, collecting data across 36 provider organisations (including acute, mental health and speciality), 12 of which we studied as in-depth ethnographic case studies. We used a combination of semi-structured interviews with programme leads, vendors and national policy leads, non-participant observations of meetings and workshops, and analysed national and local documents. This allowed us to explore both how inter-organisational learning and knowledge sharing was planned, and how it played out in practice. Thematic qualitative analysis, combining findings from diverse data sources, was facilitated by NVivo 11 and drew on sociotechnical systems theory. Results Formally established GDE and FF partnerships were perceived to enhance learning and accelerate adoption of technologies in most pairings. They were seen to be most successful where they had encouraged, and were supported by, informal knowledge networking, driven by the mutual benefits of information sharing. Informal networking was enhanced where the benefits were maximised (for example where paired sites had implemented the same technological system) and networking costs minimised (for example by geographical proximity, prior links and institutional alignment). Although the intervention anticipated uni-directional learning between exemplar sites and 'followers', in most cases we observed a two-way flow of information, with GDEs also learning from FFs, through informal networking which also extended to other health service providers outside the Programme. The efforts of the GDE Programme to establish a learning ecosystem has enhanced the profile of shared learning within the NHS. Conclusions Inter-organisational partnerships have produced significant gains for both follower (FF) and exemplar (GDE) sites. Formal linkages were most effective where they had facilitated, and were supported by, informal networking. Informal networking was driven by the mutual benefits of information sharing and was optimised where sites were well aligned in terms of technology, geography and culture. Misalignments that created barriers to networking between organisations in a few cases were attributed to inappropriate choice of partners. Policy makers seeking to promote learning through centrally directed mechanisms need to create a framework that enables networking and informal knowledge transfer, allowing local organisations to develop bottom-up collaboration and exchanges, where they are productive, in an organic manner.

Design/methodology/approach Based on the transformational leadership theory and the team learning theory, it is proposed that all four dimensions of transformational leadership, including intellectual stimulation, individualized consideration, inspirational motivation and idealized influence, have unique impact on employee knowledge sharing. It is further proposed that psychology safety and team efficacy mediate these relationships. Then data were collected from over 400 employees from knowledge-based companies in China to empirically test the proposed relationships with the method of structural equation modeling. Findings The results show that psychological safety fully mediated the impact of intellectual stimulation on knowledge sharing, and team efficacy fully mediated the impact of inspirational motivation on knowledge sharing. Both factors also mediated the impact of individualized consideration on knowledge sharing. The results thus provide empirical support for the impact of transformational leadership on employee knowledge sharing in an international context. Originality/value The past years have seen increasing interest in leadership and knowledge sharing in emerging markets, yet the mechanism through which leadership affects employee knowledge sharing remains understudied.

WOA has a simple structure, few parameters, high search capability, and easy implementation. However, it suffers from the same problems as other metaheuristic algorithms of being prone to local optima and slow convergence, for which the Multi-Strategy Whale Optimization Algorithm (MSWOA) is proposed. Four strategies are introduced in MSWOA. Firstly, a highly randomized chaotic logistic map is used to generate a high-quality initial population. Secondly, exploitation and exploration are enhanced by setting adaptive weights and dynamic convergence factors. Further, a LÃ©vy flight mechanism is introduced to maintain the population diversity in each iteration. Finally, the Evolutionary Population Dynamics (EPD) mechanism is introduced to improve the efficiency of search agents in finding the optimum. Another problem lies in the Semi-Supervised Extreme Learning Machine (SSELM) based on manifold regularization is an effective classification and regression model, but the random generation of input weights and hidden layer thresholds and the grid selection of hyperparameters lead to unsatisfactory classification performance. To this end, we developed the MSWOA-SSELM model, optimally selected the parameters of SSLEM using MSWOA, and applied it to logging layer recognition, which effectively improved the accuracy of logging interpretation. By comparing the experiments with 14 swarm intelligence algorithms on 18 benchmark test functions, the CEC2017 benchmark suite, and an engineering application problem, the experimental results show that MSWOA is significantly superior and effective in solving global optimization problems. Finally, the proposed MSWOA-SSELM is applied in three wells and outperforms other classification models in terms of Accuracy (ACC), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

(2021),HiAM: A Hierarchical Attention based Model for knowledge graph multi-hop reasoning,NEURAL NETWORKS,,10.1016/j.neunet.2021.06.008,"Learning to reason in large-scale knowledge graphs has attracted much attention from research communities recently. This paper targets a practical task of multi-hop reasoning in knowledge graphs, which can be applied in various downstream tasks such as question answering, and recommender systems. A key challenge in multi-hop reasoning is to synthesize structural information (e.g., paths) in knowledge graphs to perform deeper reasoning. Existing methods usually focus on connection paths between each entity pair. However, these methods ignore predecessor paths before connection paths and regard entities and relations within every single path as equally important. With our observations, predecessor paths before connection paths can provide more accurate semantic representations. Furthermore, entities and relations in a single path contribute variously to the right answers. To this end, we propose a novel model HiAM (Hierarchical Attention based Model) for knowledge graph multi-hop reasoning. HiAM makes use of predecessor paths to provide more accurate semantics for entities and explores the effects of different granularities. Firstly, we extract predecessor paths of head entities and connection paths between each entity pair. Then, a hierarchical attention mechanism is designed to capture the information of different granularities, including entity/relation-level and path-level features. Finally, multi-granularity features are fused together to predict the right answers. We go one step further to select the most significant path as the explanation for predicted answers. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance compared with the baselines on three benchmark datasets. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The mediating effect of absorptive capacity,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT,,10.1108/EJIM-02-2019-0043,"Purpose Open innovation and information systems have been key topics in the theoretical domain, but little empirical research thoroughly examines how information technology (IT) capability affects open innovation performance. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between IT capability and open innovation performance and to expose the inner mechanism at the firm level. Design/methodology/approach This paper collected firm-level data in China; 232 usable questionnaires from different firms were collected. Then, the study used a structural equation model by AMOS for hypothesis testing. Findings The results indicate that both internal IT capability and external IT capability have positive impacts on open innovation performance; potential absorptive capacity and realized absorptive capacity mediate the relationship between external IT capability and open innovation performance. Additionally, realized absorptive capacity plays a mediating role in the relationship between internal IT capability and open innovation performance. Originality/value Existing research has emphasized the influence of IT on open innovation, but empirical studies have not thoroughly focused on the inner mechanisms of the effect of IT capability on open innovation performance. Drawing on firm capability theory, this paper classifies IT capability as internal and external IT capability and absorptive capacity as potential and realized absorptive capacity.

In light of this, this study aims to explore the influence of supply chain knowledge, non-supply chain learning and corporate reputation on green innovation. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a quantitative research approach where data is gathered from managers of 208 small and medium enterprises in Ghana using survey questionnaires. The structural equation modeling is used to analyze the survey data. Findings: The findings reveal supply chain knowledge relates positively with non-supply chain learning, corporate reputation and green innovation. Corporate reputation also impacts green innovation positively and provides partial mediation effect between supply chain knowledge and green innovation. Meanwhile, non-supply chain learning does not relate positively with green innovation as well as fails to mediate the impact of supply chain knowledge on green innovation. Originality/value: This study contributes to knowledge in the mediating mechanisms of corporate reputation and non-supply chain learning between supply chain knowledge and green innovation. Through this, the authors propose a theoretical model to explain how firms can leverage supply chain knowledge, corporate reputation and non-supply chain learning to improve green innovation and can serve as the basis for further theoretical and empirical research in innovation and external sources of knowledge.

(2020),Modifying the Bass diffusion model to study adoption of radical new foods-The case of edible insects in the Netherlands,PLOS ONE,,10.1371/journal.pone.0234538,"Developing new food products is a complex process. Even if a company performs new product development activities successfully, it is still uncertain if consumers will adopt the product. The Bass diffusion model has often been used to study product adoption. However, existing modifications of the Bass diffusion model do not capture the complexity of consumer food choice and they have limitations in situations where there is no sales data. To avoid these challenges, the system dynamics approach can be employed. This paper aimed at extending the existing system dynamics Bass diffusion model to investigate the dynamic adoption process of insect-based food from a consumer research perspective. We performed a structured review of the literature on edible insects to build the model. The model was used to study adoption of the product amongst consumers in the Netherlands. Simulations revealed that diffusion of a radical innovation, such as an insect-based burger, can proceed for many years before there are observable adopters in the total population, under the currently reported practices in the Netherlands. Expanding awareness of this innovation requires many decades, which can be quickened by developing strategies aimed at increasing word-of-mouth. Nevertheless, the low likelihood to adopt such food remains a challenge towards full adoption, even when the sensory quality of products is improved. To fully explore how to improve the diffusion outcome of edible insects, more knowledge on mechanisms related to positive and negative word-of-mouth, and adoption of insect-based burgers by people who initially reject them, is needed. Our study demonstrated that system dynamics models could have potential in designing new food product strategies in companies, as they facilitate decision-making and uncover knowledge gaps.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234538,WOS,Journal

The actively expanding field of emerging, embeddable non-volatile memory (eNVM) technologies is providing many potential candidates to satisfy this need.

Within six years, thirteen additional states had established outdoor recreation offices â€“ six of which were established in 2019. By applying concepts explored through policy innovation and diffusion theory, this research provides insight into the rapid acceleration of the creation of state outdoor recreation offices. Particular emphasis is placed on the role of policy entrepreneurs and diffusion mechanisms. Specifically, we analyze the potential role of the policy learning, economic competition, and geographic proximity diffusion mechanisms. Data collected from in-depth, semi-structured interviews with state office leadership and non-profit organizations suggest that the policy learning mechanism acts most strongly to drive the establishment of state outdoor recreation offices or similar entities. By creating networks of government agencies focused on outdoor recreation, government officials and outdoor recreation advocates can facilitate further learning about and development of these offices. Management implications: This research suggests that the most expedient pathway toward a state outdoor recreation office is through peer-to-peer policy learning. Participation in the National Governors Association Outdoor Recreation Learning Network can help facilitate this policy learning process for state governments. State governments are also encouraged to work directly with a sponsoring state, which is required to sign onto the Confluence Accords. In doing so, states with existing offices can systemically transfer their institutional knowledge to other state governments. While this paper focuses on the outdoor recreation offices themselves, the broader implication is that states with effective outdoor recreation offices are positioned to provide direct, institutional support for expanding outdoor recreation opportunities and their associated economic, social, and environmental benefits. This research focuses on this phenomenon in the United States, however learning networks could facilitate opportunities for learning amongst global governmental agencies looking to support outdoor recreation as well.

The objectives of this study were twofold: to explore the eVisa experience of tourists who have previously visited Turkey by using the service and to analyse the perceptions of stakeholders who have contributed to eVisa. Design/methodology/approach The present research has utilised two methodologies within the context of qualitative research methods. Data were gathered from tourists by using reviews (n = 1690) and in-depth interviews key actors (n = 4), which represent consumers and contributors' perspectives on the eVisa system, respectively. While consumers dictate the demand of the service, contributors control its supply. The contributors referenced herein are relevant eVisa stakeholders in Antalya. Findings The research findings revealed eVisa facilitation's positive effects on a destination's image and tourists' intentions to revisit destinations compared to when they use traditional visa-obtaining processes. The research findings then present suitable data for destination managers and policymakers regarding eVisa facilitation, followed by this study's conclusions and implications. Research limitations/implications eVisa facilitation can foster demand for travel and tourism while maintaining bureaucratic elements of the traditional visa procedure. From a psychological perspective, eVisa facilitation can positively affect travel motivation to certain destinations where eVisas are applicable, as well as positively influence intentions to revisit tourist destinations.

The construction innovation literature is highly fragmented and outlines an overwhelming number of factors that arguably influence the transfer of technological innovations in construction. Factor-based research in the construction innovation literature tends to set out technological innovations and their adoption as socially neutral events, overlooking the role of context in the adoption process. Hence, the authorsâ€™ understanding of how technological innovations are transferred and implemented in the construction industry remains limited by the constraints of reductionist approaches adopted by factor-based research. This paper aims to advance the authorsâ€™ understanding of the actual experiences of technological innovations transfer in construction. Instead of introducing another set of factors, the research, through empirical investigation, develops a comprehensive and holistic framework to re-interpret the existing factor-based literature taking into consideration the role of the construction context and the socially constructed nature of technological innovations. Design/methodology/approach: This research uses a participatory exploratory multiple case study design strategy, which has much in common with action research. The factors that could influence the transfer of technological innovations were investigated in three selected case studies over an extended period of time. During the research, a prototype system application of construction integration was used as a basis to discuss the adoption of technological innovations. Findings: The findings suggest moving from the commonly held beliefs in the rational school of technological innovation and the functionalist paradigm towards constructivist approaches to capture the role of context and the stoically constructed nature of technological innovations. It is suggested that construction companies need to develop management capabilities to manage the changing political environments of the adoption process. The research supports the emerging view of technological innovations in construction as a collaborative-based innovation, which is a function of relationships and context. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited by the settings of the action research design and the use of an interpretive approach. Because the focus was on investigating the â€œwhyâ€ question, little attention was given to the â€œhowâ€ question. Accordingly, the findings provide little insights into the way organizations can manage the changing political and social environment of the adoption process. The authors also acknowledge that in spite of their best efforts to build a theoretically grounded framework of factors, they may have overlooked some relevant studies. However, the objective of this research was not to conduct a systematic literature review or to come up with a framework that quantitatively captures all previous research studies; instead, the objective was to build a holistic framework that can be used as a base to analyze the role of construction context and the socially constructed nature of technological innovations in the adoption process. Practical implications: The research offers several practical insights. First, it suggests that construction companies need to develop management capabilities to be able to lead the changing political environment of the adoption process successfully. Second, the research supports the emerging view of technological innovations in construction as a collaborative-based innovation that is a function of relationship. From a policy perspective, the research provides the basis to reconsider the effectiveness of federal and provincial policies that promote advanced technological Initiatives. The majority of these policies focus on the technical aspects in assessing the adoption of technological innovation, providing little incentives to companies to manage the changing political and social environment of the adoption process. Originality/value: This research offers several theoretical and methodological contributions. First, it advances the authorsâ€™ understanding of the actual experiences of the transfer of technological innovations in construction organizations. Second, instead of introducing another set of factors, the research develops a framework to re-interpret the existing factor-based literature, considering the role of construction context and the socially constructed nature of technological innovations. The research uses the theoretical lens of the social construction of technology framework to analyze the adoption process. The existing literature suggests that such research is scarce and highly needed. Third, unlike the mainstream reductionist approaches, this research adopts an exploratory action research inquiry design that uses both inductive and deductive inquiry approaches to understand the socially constructed nature of innovation transfer in construction. The adopted research design offers a valuable methodological contribution to the existing body of knowledge.

By adopting the Intellectual capital-based view (ICV) as the underpinning theory, this study aims to investigate the green intellectual capital and social innovation tie-up. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative research approach was adopted in this study. The mail survey was used to collect data from managers of 509 manufacturing units operating in J&K, India. The study model was tested using structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings Based on the SEM results, the key factors that significantly influence social innovation were green human capital and green structural capital. The results also posited that green relational capital was not significantly related to social innovation. Originality/value As revealed by the existing literature, no similar work has been done yet. Therefore, this study's originality lies in its exploration of green intellectual capital (IC) and social innovation interplay in an environmentally sensitive sector, manufacturing.

In this regard, the key innovation challenges that enterprises face are liabilities associated with their age and size, and the entry barriers imposed on them. In this line, a growing number of enterprises are starting to implement innovation practices in which they employ both internal/external flows of knowledge in order to explore/exploit innovation in collaboration with commercial or scientific agents. Within this context, universities play a significant role providing fertile knowledge-intensive environments to support the exploration and exploitation of innovative and entrepreneurial ideas, especially in emerging economies, where governments have created subsidies to promote enterprise innovation through compulsory university partnerships. Based on these ideas, the purpose of this exploratory research is to provide a better understanding about the role of universities on enterprises' innovation practices in emerging economies. More concretely, in the context of Mexico, we explored the enterprises' motivations to collaborate with universities in terms of innovation purposes (exploration and exploitation) or alternatives to access to public funds (compulsory requirement of being involved in a university partnership). Using a sample of 10,167 Mexican enterprises in the 2012 Research and Technological Development Survey collected by the Mexican National Institute of Statistics and Geography, we tested a multinomial regression model.

To close the gap between mechanistic understanding and synthetic prediction, we have made efforts to implement mechanistic knowledge in machine learning modelling of organic transformation, as a way to achieve accurate predictions of reactivity, regio- and stereoselectivity. We have constructed a comprehensive and balanced computational database for target radical transformations (arene C-H functionalization and HAT reaction), which laid the foundation for the reactivity and selectivity prediction. Furthermore, we found that the combination of computational statistics and physical organic descriptors offers a practical solution to build machine learning structure-performance models for reactivity and regioselectivity. To allow machine learning modelling of stereoselectivity, a structured database of asymmetric hydrogenation of olefins was built, and we designed a chemical heuristics-based hierarchical learning approach to effectively use the big data in the early stage of catalysis screening. Our studies reflect a tiny portion of the exciting developments of machine learning in organic chemistry. The synergy between mechanistic knowledge and machine learning will continue to generate a strong momentum to push the limit of reaction performance prediction in organic chemistry. How do you get into this specific field? Could you please share some experiences with our readers? Based on my study experience in Prof. Houk's lab and Prof. Norskov's lab, my major idea since the beginning of my lab is to combine the key design principles of homogeneous catalysis (transition state model) and heterogeneous (scaling relationship) catalysis. This idea eventually evolved to our explorations of mechanism-based machine learning in organic chemistry. How do you supervise your students? I try my best to give them enough space and freedom, so they can experience the joy in chemistry research. What are your hobbies? I enjoy science fiction movies and novels. What is the most important personality for scientific research? Chemistry has unlimited frontiers. Targeting a hardcore question, developing someone's own approach is the most important merit in fundamental scientific research. How do you keep balance between research and family? Work-life balance is certainly one of the biggest challenges for junior faculty. I try to work in fragmented time, so I would be available for both my family and my students. Who influences you mostly in your life? My high-school experience in Chemistry Olympiad has influenced me dramatically, which cultivated my independent learning ability to tackle new questions.

Nevertheless, instructors and students frequently have concerns with their capacity to succeed in E-learning environments. Objectives: This study aimed to presents common eLearning challenges in regard to e-learning courses structure and its relations to various factors, for instance; studentsâ€™ autonomy, prior knowledge and experience, students-students dialogue, and students-instructor dialogue, and proposes solutions to these challenges based on the transactional distance theory. Moreover, this study presents evidence from Malaysian higher institutions based on theoretical models for e-learning course structure and its relations to the factors mentioned above. Methods: Data have been collected from 680 university learners all over Malaysia. Data were then examined using exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation modelling employing Smart PLS 3.0 software. Results and conclusion: Research findings indicated that e-learning course structure was affected by all dimensions of overall path analysis findings: student autonomy, students background, student-instructor dialogue, and student-student dialogue. However, the e-learning course structure showed insignificant with studentsâ€™ prior experience. Implications: Implications for universities are discussed accordingly. Such findings provide vital support to the integrative association among collaborative control (CC) and transactional distance theory (TDT) regarding e-learning environments experience, which might support universities administrators in the higher education industry to implement, plan and evaluate online learning platforms applications in their institutions.

(2017),Openness and innovation performance An empirical analysis of openness determinants and performance mediators,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT,,10.1108/EJIM-06-2016-0061,"Purpose - Focusing on some relevant constructs defined by the open innovation (OI) literature (i.e. determinants of openness; openness choices operationalized in terms of collaboration depth with scientific and business partners; organizational and social context; innovation performance in terms of novelty and efficiency), this paper investigates the relationships among such constructs. More specifically, the purpose of this paper is to empirically analyse two types of relationships: between some contextual factors and firms' openness choices; and among openness choices, a set of organizational- managerial and social factors, and OI performance outcomes. Design/methodology/approach - The authors carried out a theory testing survey, involving four European countries (Finland, Italy, Sweden and the UK). The authors applied descriptive statistics and a series of regressions. Findings - The authors analysed the impact exerted by external and internal variables on the collaboration depth with scientific and business partners: technological trends are relevant to move firms towards external collaborations, with both types of partners; efficiency goals pursued in collaborations are related to the collaboration depth with both types of partners, while an aggressive innovation strategy is positively related only to scientificpartner depth. Besides, collaboration depths with both partners are positively related to the both sides of innovation performance (i.e. novelty and efficiency), but the organizational-managerial and social contexts emerge as relevant mediator variables. Organizational-managerial and external relational social capital exert a beneficial role on the both types of innovation performance, while internal relational social capital benefits only novelty. Research limitations/implications - The work shows important limitations such as the low level of the explanatory values in the regression models. Therefore, the results must be considered as preliminary explorative insights that may be useful to encourage further studies. Practical implications - This work serves to raise managers' awareness on the opportunity of developing organizational-managerial mechanisms, as well as on the importance of social capital to profit from collaborations. Originality/value - Although during the last decade many researchers have claimed that we are in the era of OI, empirical works, which provide both a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of the phenomenon, are still few. Moreover, the specific action of the context (managerial, organizational and social) as possible mediator of the performance outcomes of openness is empirically under-studied. The authors' work attempts to fulfil these gaps.",2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EJIM-06-2016-0061,WOS,Journal

However, none have been highly satisfying in lessening the impact of disasters. The signifcant factor for the limited success of modern scientifc society is that it views the world from a temporal perspective where humans are believed to be an active agent in modifying every natural possibility into opportunity. The very composite environmental system is simplified whilst extracting resources, resulting in resource depletion and environmental degradation, consequently opening the door for disaster. Technocratic science must recognise the need for a relational or holistic approach rather than believing in reductionist approaches alone whilst dealing with natural calamities. In this context, the knowledge of traditional societies is important to fill up the existing gaps created by the modern society. Traditional knowledge has different sets of ingredients to foster the development of the relational or holistic approach as it involves, interacts and interconnects humans, non-humans (animals and plants) and nature together, setting a perfect balance for sustainable development and DRR. It has vast undocumented observational data of changing natural phenomena, and in todayâ€™s scenario of climate change and uncertainty, it can create a path for reliable adaptation measures from climate-induced disasters. Thus, a holistic approach is needed for comprehensive DRR measures where both scientific and traditional knowledge systems can work together. The main purpose of this article was to explore the effective ingredients of traditional knowledge in DRR and how this age-old wisdom can be offered a hand to its integration into and collaboration with scientific research and management for DRR. To fulfil the objectives, a theoretical desk study approach was followed by identifying relevant studies, highlighting traditional knowledge in DRR from empirical and grey literatures, archive materials, biblical stories and so on. This research highlights some of the good practices of traditional knowledge in DRR and the possible path of collaboration of two knowledge systems in DRR. Â© 2019. The Authors. Licensee: AOSIS.

Traditional evaluation designs assume a high level of predictability and control. The problem is that complex programs or contexts challenge this basic assumption. Often programs deal with emergent outcomes and objectives, adaptive program processes, nonlinear theories of change and evolving stakeholder expectations. Under such complex conditions, traditional evaluation methods and tools do not allow realistic and useful representations of reality. In these instances, we need a more adaptive approach to evaluation. One that fits the environment without compromising rigor. In this paper, we articulate what we have found useful in seeing patterns in complex programs, understanding the dynamics in ways that are meaningful to stakeholders and recommending Adaptive Actions to improve impacts over time. In our work, synergy has emerged between complexity theory (through the lens of human systems dynamics) and evaluation practice (through a case study of a complex program of social change). What emerges at this generative intersection is an evaluation method that is simple, robust, rigorous and flexible enough to meet the demands of twenty-first century social change. We will explore the implications of this approach for theory and practice in complexity and evaluation, and we will share some questions that are emerging for us as we prepare for our next cycle of theory and practice development. In this paper, we provide an overview of the challenge and previous efforts to address it, an introduction to basic theory and practice of human systems dynamics (HSD) and theoretical foundations for a new approach to evaluation in complex environments, Adaptive Evaluation.

The tactic is based on an understanding of thermo-mechanics of shape memory polymers (SMP) and fabrication concept behind FDM as well as experiments to explore how FDM can program self-foldable metamaterials. Self-folding mechanism is investigated in terms of fabrication parameters like printing-speed and liquefier-temperature that affect layer-by-layer programming process and shape-change. It can be called a functionally graded 4D printing so that the structure is fabricated additively and programmed functionally. A finite element (FE) formulation based on the non-linear Green-Lagrange kinematic relations coupled with a robust SMP constitutive model is established to describe material tailoring in fabrication stage and deformation. Governing equations with material-geometric non-linearities are solved by implementing iterative Newton-Raphson method to trace large-deformation non-linear equilibrium path. FDM and FE solution are then applied to digitally design and fabricate straight/curved beams as structural primitives for adaptive metamaterials that show 1D/2D-to-2D/3D shape-shifting by self-folding or/and self-coiling. Finally, it is experimentally shown that the 4D printed metamaterials have great potential in mechanical/biomedical applications like structural/dynamical switches, self-conforming substrates, self-tightening surgical sutures, self-conforming splints and self-coiling/deploying stents.

It is regarded as an accumulation of information about a building anchored to a model. Consequently, BIM has been widely applied to manage information in construction projects. On the other hand, knowledge integrates context, experience, rules, and capability, which is at a higher level than information. Knowledge has also been widely recognized as one of the most important factors in construction projects. Therefore, close attention should be paid to knowledge management (KM) in construction projects. Compared to traditional information technology (IT) systems, BIM is characterized by object-oriented and parameter-driven modeling. How these characteristics can improve KM is a matter that has not been fully explored. To bridge the knowledge gap, this study first explores the existing tools used for KM in construction projects. Following this, the potentials of BIM for the improvement of KM are identified and the expectations for BIM-supported KM are outlined. A total of 30 industrial experts in the UK and Ireland were interviewed as the main research method in this study. Based on the analysis of interview results, a conceptual model is developed for BIM-supported KM.

(2022),Knowledge structure enhanced graph representation learning model for attentive knowledge tracing,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS,,10.1002/int.22763,"Knowledge tracing (KT) is a fundamental personalized-tutoring technique for learners in online learning systems. Recent KT methods employ flexible deep neural network-based models that excel at this task. However, the adequacy of KT is still challenged by the sparseness of the learners' exercise data. To alleviate the sparseness problem, most of the exiting KT studies are performed at the skill-level rather than the question-level, as questions are often numerous and associated with much fewer skills. However, at the skill level, KT neglects the distinctive information related to the questions themselves and their relations. In this case, the models can imprecisely infer the learners' knowledge states and might fail to capture the long-term dependencies in the exercising sequences. In the knowledge domain, skills are naturally linked as a graph (with the edges being the prerequisite relations between pedagogical concepts). We refer to such a graph as a knowledge structure (KS). Incorporating a KS into the KT procedure can potentially resolve both the sparseness and information loss, but this avenue has been underexplored because obtaining the complete KS of a domain is challenging and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a novel KS-enhanced graph representation learning model for KT with an attention mechanism (KSGKT). We first explore eight methods that automatically infer the domain KS from learner response data and integrate it into the KT procedure. Leveraging a graph representation learning model, we then obtain the question and skill embeddings from the KS-enhanced graph. To incorporate more distinctive information on the questions, we extract the cognitive question difficulty from the learning history of each learner. We then propose a convolutional representation method that fuses these disctinctive features, thus obtaining a comprehensive representation of each question. These representations are input to the proposed KT model, and the long-term dependencies are handled by the attention mechanism. The model finally predicts the learner's performance on new problems. Extensive experiments conducted from six perspectives on three real-world data sets demonstrated the superiority and interpretability of our model for learner-performance modeling. Based on the KT results, we also suggest three potential applications of our model.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/int.22763,WOS,Journal

Design/methodology/approach This study takes systems approach to examine complementarity, combining a productivity and an adoption approach. In addition, interaction approach is also used as robustness check. Findings The authors show that the positive effect of export activity on firms' growth rate is higher for firms that also engage in technology import, and vice versa. Furthermore, they show that, Ceteris paribus, firms' adoption of one cross-border learning mechanism (e.g. entering export markets) positively influences the adoption of the other (e.g. technology import). Moreover, this complementarity is only significant for firms from province with low level of marketization. Research limitations/implications - This inconsistency about learning-by-exporting and technology import on innovation can be resolved, at least partially, by the complementarities perspective. This paper also reveals two mechanisms of learning-by-exporting: the indirect effect of export on innovation through increasing the likelihood of adoption decision of importing technology and enhancing the positive effect of technology imports. Practical implications - The potential of combining the two strategies should not be ignored by managers.

Chain actors face multiple challenges associated with the adoption of novel processing technologies. Bio-based technologies might be related to high switching costs, missing downstream processing technologies, lack of quality standards, missing industry standards, emerging regulatory frameworks. Moreover, as previously unrelated actors form new relationships, value chains are moving towards new structural changes. This paper thus seeks to explore the challenges associated with the emergence of novel value chains with an exploratory case study approach that reviews a new process of recovering phosphate - a typical scarce and fundamental resource - from rapeseed oil press cakes. The contribution of our paper is thus not only to provide conclusions for this specific case, but also, and more importantly, to present a blueprint for other cases of scarce resources that require the establishment of novel supply chains to foster cascading usage of byproducts. Expert interviews with different value chain actors have been conducted to investigate arising challenges, and derive implications and a further research agenda. Despite the advantages of the bio-based process, interviews revealed several challenges associated with the emergence of novel value chains: hesitation of respondents in making new investments in terms of equipment and know-how, missing complementary competencies, and difficulties in integrating different industrial sectors to engage in cross-industry innovation, such as food processing (rapeseed oil cakes) and specialty chemicals/mineral (phosphate and its derivatives). These exploratory results open the way for some useful recommendations, enabling us to propose an agenda for further research and policy development in areas such as: development of synergies between academia and industry; formulation of management strategies to support the flexibility of firms to capture opportunities associated with by-product valorization; building a systemic approach at a local level to implement bio-based technology clusters.

However, there are no historical examples or current models to emulate. Scholarly analyses of putative initiatives to green industrialisation, especially in developing countries, are few and limited. This article explores the conception and implementation of green industrialisation in Ethiopia, one of the world's poorest nations, where an ambitious Climate Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) strategy has been created, alongside a multi-sectoral Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP), to leapfrog environmentally unsustainable development and bring the country to middle-income status by 2025. Using the sociotechnical transition (STT) perspective and in particular Smith, Stirling, and Berkhout (2005) framework for assessing sustainable transition programmes, it analyzes the 'selection pressures' on the industrial 'regime' and its 'adaptive capacity'. It finds: (i) clear articulation of the imperative for climate change mitigation and economic growth; (ii) strong high-level government commitment to a greening agenda within the context of accelerated industrialisation; and (iii) a nascent innovation system that is beginning to evolve according to these priorities. However, the analysis also identifies important challenges, including: coordination mechanisms between different stakeholders; framing issues; availability of resources; and ongoing tension between addressing climate change and promoting economic growth. It also highlights the importance of the availability of cross-border resources for purposive sustainability transition within low-income countries. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Subsequently, this study analyzes the relationships between absorptive capacity (internal knowledge-based driver), relationship learning (external knowledge-based driver) and green innovation performance. Design/methodology/approach This study relies on a sample of 112 firms belonging to the Spanish automotive components manufacturing sector (ACMS) and uses partial least squares path modeling to test the hypotheses proposed. Findings The empirical results show that both absorptive capacity and relationship learning exert a significant positive effect on the dependent variable and that relationship learning moderates the link between absorptive capacity and green innovation performance. Research limitations/implications This paper presents some limitations with respect to the particular sector (i.e. the ACMS) and geographical context (Spain). For this reason, researchers must be thoughtful while generalizing these results to distinct scenarios. Practical implications Managers should devote more time and resources to reinforce their absorptive capacity as an important strategic tool to generate new knowledge and hence foster green innovation performance in manufacturing industries. Social implications The paper shows the importance of encouraging decision-makers to cultivate and rely on relationship learning mechanisms with their main stakeholders and to acquire the necessary information and knowledge that might be valuable in the maturity of green innovations. Originality/value This study proposes that relationship learning plays a moderating role in the relationship between absorptive capacity and green innovation performance.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JKM-07-2017-0310,WOS,Journal

This can also shed light on why, despite many attempts, process improvement programs often fail to produce such long-term solutions. Design/methodology/approach A case study is carried out to inductively describe and classify problem-solving in companies and to indicate why problem-solving efforts are typically bounded to short-term solutions. The empirical findings are triangulated with findings from the extant literature. Findings First, the authors propose three problem-solving modes with different characteristics and potential impacts on operational performance: intuitive problem-solving, semi-structured problem-solving and systematic problem-solving. Second, by emphasizing dynamic capabilities' micro-foundations and with the focus on learning mechanisms, the authors show that, among these modes, only systematic problem-solving can serve as a dynamic capability with fundamental solutions. Third, based on insights from the case study, the authors address behavioral and organizational impediments that curb dynamic capabilities and limit systematic problem-solving adoption. Originality/value This study is an empirically informed attempt to understand systematic problem-solving as a dynamic capability. The authors uncover the micro-foundations and the learning mechanisms through which systematic problem-solving becomes a dynamic capability. By highlighting problem-solving orientation as a hardly investigated dimension of improvement programs, the authors show that a mixture of a static problem-solving approach and a set of impediments at both individual and organizational levels is the major reason of failures of improvement programs over time.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/MD-08-2020-1097,WOS,Journal

A data-driven approach is used to analyze the evolving characteristics of knowledge dynamics from static, dynamic and future-oriented perspective. To this end, a network analysis was performed to determine the influence of individual knowledge areas. Subsequently, an interaction trend analysis based on emergence indicators was conducted to highlight the promising relations.

However, one of the limiting factors for potential applications is their chemical and structural instability in different environments. Herein, the stability of (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskite solar cell is explored in different atmospheres using impedance spectroscopy. An equivalent circuit model and distribution of relaxation times (DRTs) are used to effectively analyze impedance spectra. DRT is further analyzed via machine learning workflow based on the non-negative matrix factorization of reconstructed relaxation time spectra. This exploration provides the interplay of charge transport dynamics and recombination processes under environment stimuli and illumination. The results reveal that in the dark, oxygen atmosphere induces an increased hole concentration with less ionic character while ionic motion is dominant under ambient air. Under 1 Sun illumination, the environment-dependent impedance responses show a more striking effect compared with dark conditions. In this case, the increased transport resistance observed under oxygen atmosphere in equivalent circuit analysis arises due to interruption of photogenerated hole carriers. The results not only shed light on elucidating transport mechanisms of perovskite solar cells in different environments but also offer an effective interpretation of impedance responses.

The dynamic spatial econometric models (DSDM) find a significant negative association between digital finance and pollutants emissions, and the impacts vary among regions and urban development stages. The impact mechanism test proves that digital finance reduces pollutants emissions through technological innovation, structural adjustment, and capital allocation effects. In addition, we explore the different dimensions of digital finance and find that the depth of use has a more practical effect on reducing emissions. Further analyses based on the threshold model show an inverted N-shaped nexus between digital finance and emissions. The threshold effect also exists in terms of the traditional financial level. Our study proves that emerging digital finance crucially affects its potential benefits to environment and provides an empirical basis for policy-makers to accelerate the digitalization of financial markets, particularly paying attention to its emission-reduction effects.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-18465-4,WOS,Journal

(2022),Hierarchical reinforcement learning with dynamic recurrent mechanism for course recommendation,KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS,,10.1016/j.knosys.2022.108546,"In online learning scenarios, the learners usually hope to find courses that meet their preferences and the needs for their future developments. Thus, there is a great need to develop effective personalized course recommender systems that can guide the learners to choose suitable courses. In practice, Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be applied to build dynamic user profiles from users' interactions with courses, which is the key to the success of a course recommender system. However, existing RL-based course recommendation methods usually suffer from the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. In this paper, we propose a novel course recommendation model, namely Hierarchical rEinforcement Learning with dynAmic Recurrent mechanism (HELAR), in which a profile constructor with autonomous learning ability is designed to make personalized course recommendation. To address the exploration-exploitation trade-off issue in constructing user profiles, we propose a novel policy gradient method. It employs a recurrent scheme by context-aware learning to exploit the current knowledge, while utilizing a dynamic baseline to explore the user's future preferences. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed HELAR model, and the experimental results demonstrate the advantage of HELAR over state-of-the-art course recommendation methods.

The purpose of this study is to recognize the implications of AI on employability by analyzing the issues in the health-care sector that if not addressed, can dampen the possibilities offered by AI intervention and its pervasiveness (Cornell University, INSEAD, and WIPO, 2019). Design/methodology/approach: To get an insight on these concerns, an approach of total interpretive structural modelling, cross impact matrix multiplication applied to classification and path analysis have been used to understand the role of the critical factors influencing employability in the health-care sector. Findings: This study primarily explores the driving-dependence power of the critical factors of the employability and displays hierarchical relationships. It also discusses measures which, if adopted, can enhance employability in the health-care sector with the intervention of AI. Research limitations/implications: Employability also has an impact on the productivity of the health-care service delivery which may provide a holistic opportunity to the management in health-care organizations to forecast the allocation and training of human resources and technological resources. Originality/value: The paper attempts to analyze AI intervention and other driving factors (operational changes, customized training intervention, openness to learning, attitude toward technology, job-related skills and AI knowledge) to analyze their impact on employability with the changing needs. It establishes the hierarchical relationship among the critical factors influencing employability in the health-care sector because of the intervention of AI.

(2022),An ontology-based framework for improving color vision deficiency accessibility,UNIVERSAL ACCESS IN THE INFORMATION SOCIETY,,10.1007/s10209-021-00791-6,"Web technologies provide resources for the intensive use of colors in web pages. They are a core element in the design of interactive interfaces and are essential in the perception and understanding of information. However, color intensive design on the web affects the accessibility for users with color vision deficiency (CVD), who face difficulties in recognizing or distinguishing colors. CVD users may experience limitations and barriers in exploring web pages, even for simple tasks. Interface adaptation techniques may deal with several CVD visualization issues. Nevertheless, different situations and individual preferences turn choosing the most suitable recoloring technique into a complex task. Existing proposals in the literature fail in not considering various pathology types and individual preferences. This article defines a framework and techniques for the development of adaptive interfaces that facilitate the interaction of CVD people with web systems. The proposed research develops the FAIBOUD framework, which uses ontologies as artifacts for representing knowledge about CVD types, recoloring algorithms, and users' access contexts and preferences. The FAIBOUD includes algorithms to support an adaptation decision process, which selects the most suited adaptation technique according to CVD type and access context. Our solution allows for the determination and automatic application of the best recoloring techniques to adapt interfaces for CVD users. Our experimental evaluation was conducted with fifteen CVD users. The results obtained from several illustrative scenarios demonstrate the benefits and enhancement of web interface accessibility based on our adaptive approach.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10209-021-00791-6,WOS,Journal

(2022),Deep Learning-Based Trajectory Planning and Control for Autonomous Ground Vehicle Parking Maneuver,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,,10.1109/TASE.2022.3183610,"In this paper, a novel integrated real-time trajectory planning and tracking control framework capable of dealing with autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) parking maneuver problems is presented. In the motion planning component, a newly-proposed idea of utilizing deep neural networks (DNNs) for approximating optimal parking trajectories is further extended by taking advantages of a recurrent network structure. The main aim is to fully exploit the inherent relationships between different vehicle states in the training process. Furthermore, two transfer learning strategies are applied such that the developed motion planner can be adapted to suit various AGVs. In order to follow the planned maneuver trajectory, an adaptive learning tracking control algorithm is designed and served as the motion controller. By adapting the network parameters, the stability of the proposed control scheme, along with the convergence of tracking errors, can be theoretically guaranteed. In order to validate the effectiveness and emphasize key features of our proposal, a number of experimental studies and comparative analysis were executed. The obtained results reveal that the proposed strategy can enable the AGV to fulfill the parking mission with enhanced motion planning and control performance. Note to Practitioners-This article was motivated by the problem of optimal automatic parking planning and tracking control for autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) maneuvering in a restricted environment (e.g., constrained parking regions). A number of challenges may arise when dealing with this problem (e.g., the model uncertainties involved in the vehicle dynamics, system variable limits, and the presence of external disturbances). Existing approaches to address such a problem usually exploit the merit of optimization-based planning/control techniques such as model predictive control and dynamic programming in order for an optimal solution. However, two practical issues may require further considerations: 1). The nonlinear (re)optimization process tends to consume a large amount of computing power and it might not be affordable in real-time; 2). Existing motion planning and control algorithms might not be easily adapted to suit various types of AGVs. To overcome the aforementioned issues, we present an idea of utilizing the recurrent deep neural network (RDNN) for planning optimal parking maneuver trajectories and an adaptive learning NN-based (ALNN) control scheme for robust trajectory tracking. In addition, by introducing two transfer learning strategies, the proposed RDNN motion planner can be adapted to suit different AGVs. In our follow-up research, we will explore the possibility of extending the developed methodology for large-scale AGV parking systems collaboratively operating in a more complex cluttered environment.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2022.3183610,WOS,Journal

Therefore, this study aims to shed light on the underlying mechanisms, innovation barriers, and drivers of urban innovation development in urban ecosystems. It adopts the complex adaptive system perspective that allows an exploratory analysis of intricate stakeholder interactions, being a means to achieve urban transformation.

However, individual, organizational, and ecosystem innovation resistance in the urban district hinder innovation implementation, innovation drivers instead focus on the core of the urban ecosystem.

Implementation research (IR) has the promise of supporting scale-up through enabling rapid learning about the intervention and its fit with the context in which it is implemented. We integrate conceptual frameworks addressing different dimensions of scaling up (specifically, the attributes of the service or innovation being scaled, the actors involved, the context, and the scale-up strategy) and questions commonly addressed by IR (concerning acceptability, appropriateness, adoption, feasibility, fidelity to original design, implementation costs, coverage and sustainability) to explore how IR can support scale-up. Methods: We draw upon three IR studies conducted by Future Health Systems (FHS) in Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Uganda. We reviewed project documents from the period 2011-2016 to identify information related to the dimensions of scaling up. Further, for each country, we developed rich descriptions of how the research teams approached scaling up, and how IR contributed to scale-up. The rich descriptions were checked by FHS research teams. We identified common patterns and differences across the three cases. Results: The three cases planned quite different innovations/interventions and had very different types of scale-up strategies. In all three cases, the research teams had extensive prior experience within the study communities, and little explicit attention was paid to contextual factors. All three cases involved complex interactions between the research teams and other stakeholders, among stakeholders, and between stakeholders and the intervention. The IR planned by the research teams focussed primarily on feasibility and effectiveness, but in practice, the research teams also had critical insights into other factors such as sustainability, acceptability, cost-effectiveness and appropriateness. Stakeholder analyses and other project management tools further complemented IR. Conclusions: IR can provide significant insights into how best to scale-up a particular intervention. To take advantage of insights from IR, scale-up strategies require flexibility and IR must also be sufficiently flexible to respond to new emerging questions. While commonly used conceptual frameworks for scale-up clearly delineate actors, such as implementers, target communities and the support team, in our experience, IR blurred the links between these groups.

Among the primary security mechanisms employed in these environments, the Network Intrusion Detection Systems stand out. Although the signature-based detection approach of these tools is sufficient to combat known attacks, with the eventual discovery of new vulnerabilities, it is necessary to use anomaly-based detection approaches to mitigate the damage of unknown attacks. In the academic field, several studies have explored the development of hybrid approaches to improve the accuracy of these tools, with the aid of machine learning techniques.

The physical learning environment (the learning landscape) thus includes several dimensions besides classrooms, such as buildings, campus, and the surrounding society, often combined with digital learning platforms, or virtual classrooms. However, there are emerging new classroom designs and learning strategies to support classroom interaction, active learning or collaborative learning often combined with elements of blended learning or flipped classroom. Active learning strategies are based on the idea that students are involved in more than listening, supporting inclusion and group discussions, sharing thoughts and analyzing rather than memorizing. The aim of this paper is to explore the implementation and use of ALCs in higher education to identify the experiences of students, faculty, library and university. A case study methodology approach was applied and focused on information literacy sessions co-designed by librarians and faculty in ALCs in a bachelor's program in business administration at University West, Sweden. Skills in collaborative learning and information literacy are of importance in professional life and affect students' lifelong learning, and in this paper are viewed as applications of the work-integrated learning (WIL) approach of University West where teachers and librarians interact in the new generation classroom. Mixed methods were applied including student surveys, semi-structured interviews, classroom observations and introspection. Findings indicate that students had an overall positive view of how ALCs affected their engagement, creativity, and interaction in smaller groups. Furthermore, a majority of the students viewed the information literacy session in the ALC as work-integrated learning practicing skills needed in future professional life. The organizational perspective revealed focus on pedagogical visions of active learning in higher education rather than technology.

Unfortunately, the mechanisms in this domain suffer from limited performance due to scene complexity, varying road structure, and improper illumination conditions. These challenging situations may lead an intelligent vehicle into dangerous situations such as collisions or road accidents and may cause higher mortality. The application of intelligent methods and other machine learning techniques for road surface classification is little explored in the existing literature. Thus, we propose a convolutional neural network-based road classification network (RCNet) for the accurate classification of road surfaces. This procedure includes the classification of five major categories of road surfaces: curvy, dry, ice, rough, and wet roads. The experimental results reveal the behavior of the proposed RCNet under various optimizer techniques. The standard performance evaluation measures have been used to test and validate the proposed method on the Oxford RobotCar dataset. RCNet achieves classification accuracy, precision, and sensitivity of 99.90%, and 99.97% of specificity. Results of implemented work are significantly higher than available state-of-the-art techniques and show accurate and effective performance in the complex road environment.

Evidence from the Moderated Mediating Effect Model and an Empirical Study in China,SUSTAINABILITY,,10.3390/su10030641,"Based on the Stakeholder theory, a moderated mediating effect model is developed to reach the study objective, revealing an important connection that suggests environmental regulations (ERs) influence corporate environmental responsibility (CER) (Porter Hypothesis). In building the model, the validity of the questionnaire data was analyzed with factor analysis. By employing a two-step approach, a regression analysis is utilized to discuss the mediating effect of altruistic motivation and moderating effect of green innovation, and a structural equation model is used to explore the interactive mechanism of different variables. It is found that altruistic motivation plays a medium role in the relationship between ERs and CER, and green innovation engages a positive coordination in the relationship. The empirical study identifies factors affecting enterprises' willingness to undertake environmental responsibility, including environment policies, corporate culture, and personal characters among others. It is also revealed that altruistic motivation is conducive to forming a community interests among enterprises and enhancing their resistance to market risks, which explains and corroborates the Stakeholder theory; and the higher the level of green innovation, the more willing enterprises are to implement environmentally friendly operations.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10030641,WOS,Journal

In the wake of these recent trends and complexities alongside the worldwide pandemic (COVID-19), organizations are working to provide a self-motivated and highly engaging environment for employees. The study intends to explore the relationship between Transformational Leadership (TFL) and Work Engagement (WE) with the mediating role of Structural Empowerment (SE) and Process Innovation (PI) during COVID-19. The quantitative research methodology was utilized and a simple random sampling technique was used for collection of data from 360 supervisors of banks in Pakistan using questionnaires. Hypotheses are tested with the help of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) by using AMOS. By using SEM, confirmatory factor analysis revealed a statistically significant model. Outcomes showed a significant connection among TFL, WE, and PI. However, SE only significantly relates to TFL. Partial mediation through PI was discovered with the presence of a significant indirect path between TFL and WE. In contrast, the mediation of SE is not ascertained due to insignificant indirect effects. The digitally evolving banking industry in Pakistan requires engagement at workplace. The organization must be very much aware of the crucial job of leaders for WE as well as for PI just as the SE of employees. The findings of the study also highlight the importance of best HR practices that should work for creating intangible motivators for boosting WE level.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21582440221093354,WOS,Journal

The first wave occurred at pioneering universities in the United States like MIT and Stanford, defining a university-wide patent policy, establishing a technology transfer policy, setting up university-industry partnerships and churning out new companies. The second wave occurred in Western Europe, with ivory tower universities transforming themselves into entrepreneurial institutions supporting academic entrepreneurs. In terms of newly emerging economies making up the third wave, the promotion of academic entrepreneurship is high on their political agendas and, although the actual pioneering phase has already begun, it is not clear as yet which policies or structures are needed to foster the effective transfer of academic knowledge and the incubation of start-up firms, and eventually contribute to socio-economic development. In this sense, the aim of this study is to identify potential activities and effective policies to encourage the transfer of academic technology in Brazil, being one of the emerging economies. An analytical framework of the entrepreneurial university was constructed based on existing literature, consisting of five dimensions: entrepreneurial perspective, external links, access to university resources, innovation arrangement and scientific research. In an exploratory case study, eighteen interviews were carried out with incubatee-entrepreneurs and the managers of university business incubators in southern Brazil. Although all dimensions were mentioned in the interviews as being important in promoting entrepreneurship, the key finding from our research is that most academic start-ups are based on the entrepreneur's own technologies, rather than on the university's patents. The quality of entrepreneurial training, in addition to being in close contact with applied research, encourages academics to turn their business plans into start-up ventures. To conclude, although the new ventures are not based on academic patents, they are playing a proactive and dynamic role when it comes to socio-economic developments.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2018.04.015,WOS,Journal

(2021),A Methodology for Emulsion Design Based on Emulsion Science and Expert Knowledge. Part 1: Conceptual Approach,Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research,,10.1021/acs.iecr.0c04942,"Formulated emulsions have a high commercial value due to their multiple applications in several product sectors such as cosmetics, nutrition, medicine, and household products, among others. Their design is not a simple task because emulsions are complex systems in which components, structures, phenomena, and processes are highly interrelated. Thus, any decision must be made with its multiple effects on the final product's properties in mind. Emulsion design is even more challenging at early design stages when information is scarce and critical design decisions are made. In view of the above, this study proposes a decision-making methodology for emulsion formulation applicable to early product design/screening/exploratory stages. It enables product designers to understand the product as a whole system and select a set of complementary solution strategies applicable to their specific emulsion formulation problem. The methodology presented in detail in this article comprises three steps and uses two databases, which were proposed based on emulsion science principles and connected thanks to a database of expert knowledge. In the first step, product specifications are classified according to a list of 21 general subproblems in emulsion formulation, which are related to physicochemical phenomena or properties that are to be promoted or limited in the product. In the second step, subproblems are connected to a list of 30 general solution strategies, which are solution paths related to the emulsion's nature or structure but not initially directly related to a specific compound or process technology. In the third step, solution strategies are connected to compound types and processing conditions using a second database with the aim of creating potential design concepts.

(2019),Understanding health management and safety decisions using signal processing and machine learning,BMC Medical Research Methodology,,10.1186/s12874-019-0756-2,"Background: Small group research in healthcare is important because it deals with interaction and decision-making processes that can help to identify and improve safer patient treatment and care. However, the number of studies is limited due to time- and resource-intensive data processing. The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of using signal processing and machine learning techniques to understand teamwork and behaviour related to healthcare management and patient safety, and to contribute to literature and research of teamwork in healthcare. Methods: Clinical and non-clinical healthcare professionals organised into 28 teams took part in a video- and audio-recorded role-play exercise that represented a fictional healthcare system, and included the opportunity to discuss and improve healthcare management and patient safety. Group interactions were analysed using the recurrence quantification analysis (RQA; Knight et al., 2016), a signal processing method that examines stability, determinism, and complexity of group interactions. Data were benchmarked against self-reported quality of team participation and social support. Transcripts of group conversations were explored using the topic modelling approach (Blei et al., 2003), a machine learning method that helps to identify emerging themes within large corpora of qualitative data. Results: Groups exhibited stable group interactions that were positively correlated with perceived social support, and negatively correlated with predictive behaviour. Data processing of the qualitative data revealed conversations focused on: (1) the management of patient incidents; (2) the responsibilities among team members; (3) the importance of a good internal team environment; and (4) the hospital culture. Conclusions: This study has shed new light on small group research using signal processing and machine learning methods. Future studies are encouraged to use these methods in the healthcare context, and to conduct further research on how the nature of group interaction and communication processes contribute to the quality of team and task decision-making.

(2021),Machine Learning Cybersecurity Adoption in Small and Medium Enterprises in Developed Countries,COMPUTERS,,10.3390/computers10110150,"In many developed countries, the usage of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has become important in paving the future path in how data is managed and secured in the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) sector. SMEs in these developed countries have created their own cyber regimes around AI and ML. This knowledge is tested daily in how these countries' SMEs run their businesses and identify threats and attacks, based on the support structure of the individual country. Based on recent changes to the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Brexit, and ISO standards requirements, machine learning cybersecurity (MLCS) adoption in the UK SME market has become prevalent and a good example to lean on, amongst other developed nations. Whilst MLCS has been successfully applied in many applications, including network intrusion detection systems (NIDs) worldwide, there is still a gap in the rate of adoption of MLCS techniques for UK SMEs. Other developed countries such as Spain and Australia also fall into this category, and similarities and differences to MLCS adoptions are discussed. Applications of how MLCS is applied within these SME industries are also explored. The paper investigates, using quantitative and qualitative methods, the challenges to adopting MLCS in the SME ecosystem, and how operations are managed to promote business growth. Much like security guards and policing in the real world, the virtual world is now calling on MLCS techniques to be embedded like secret service covert operations to protect data being distributed by the millions into cyberspace. This paper will use existing global research from multiple disciplines to identify gaps and opportunities for UK SME small business cyber security. This paper will also highlight barriers and reasons for low adoption rates of MLCS in SMEs and compare success stories of larger companies implementing MLCS. The methodology uses structured quantitative and qualitative survey questionnaires, distributed across an extensive participation pool directed to the SMEs' management and technical and non-technical professionals using stratify methods. Based on the analysis and findings, this study reveals that from the primary data obtained, SMEs have the appropriate cybersecurity packages in place but are not fully aware of their potential. Secondary data collection was run in parallel to better understand how these barriers and challenges emerged, and why the rate of adoption of MLCS was very low. The paper draws the conclusion that help through government policies and processes coupled together with collaboration could minimize cyber threats in combatting hackers and malicious actors in trying to stay ahead of the game. These aspirations can be reached by ensuring that those involved have been well trained and understand the importance of communication when applying appropriate safety processes and procedures. This paper also highlights important funding gaps that could help raise cyber security awareness in the form of grants, subsidies, and financial assistance through various public sector policies and training. Lastly, SMEs' lack of understanding of risks and impacts of cybercrime could lead to conflicting messages between cross-company IT and cybersecurity rules.

Nowadays, online learning is probably the most essential and used option for educational institutions all over the world to conduct their teaching and learning because of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of these institutions have implemented various learning management systems (LMS) to facilitate the delivery and measurement of their online learning programs. Since the LMS systems keep recording and tracking the fulfillment of lectures, assignments and examinations about learners and function as a big data repository, the educational data mining (EDM) could explore and analyze the learning effectiveness of learners based on their involvement in learning and teaching. In general, sophisticated machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies provide solutions to understand the behavior of learners from their personalized learning profile. However, the pervasive deep learning techniques developed for AI come from the original neural network, and their network structure and interconnected weights are considered as a black box that is hard to be interpreted by humans. To enable the deep learning techniques to provide meaningful insight about learner's outcomes, this study developed an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technique to analyze the relationship between learning inputs and corresponding achievement for each learner. The proposed XAI approach applied an innovative method of model grafting to integrate the traditional machine learning with deep learning models. The grafting method used the decision tree as a global model to provide interpretable ability and then concatenated with the local models, which could choose the deep neural network or K-nearest neighbor model. The global model was considered as the primary model to provide human-readable decision rules and variable importance, while the local model might be used to improve prediction accuracy or provide additional interpretability. As the local model could be implanted to different branches of the global model, a fusion mechanism was designed to merge the variable importance from both models for each learner. The outcome of the hybrid models might identify important factors that affect learning progress and even predict the risk of a learner failing a subject based on providing interpretable decision rules.

It analyzes the mediating effects of incremental and radical innovation within the context of entrepreneurial firms in Turkey, an emerging economy. Design/methodology/approach - This study empirically analyses the impact of strategic orientations on firm performance through innovation with a sample of 818 small and medium enterprises in Turkey. To test the proposed model, LISREL is used. Findings - Proactive market orientation (MO) and technology orientation (TO) lead to radical innovation, while responsive MO strongly affects incremental innovation. EO impacts performance directly and indirectly via both incremental and radical innovation. Practical implications - Finding suggests that senior management of firms, especially in emerging economies should encourage marketing managers to focus on key trends of markets, both existing and emerging. These marketing managers should find and work with lead users to improve radical product development. This means that those managing marketing need to be well schooled in technology, and they should also possess a proactive MO. Originality/value - The present study employs a two-part view of the MO construct (responsive and proactive MO). This conceptualization provides a greater degree of precision in the use of the MO concept which was rarely employed in prior studies. Moreover, this paper views strategic orientations as drivers of innovation and examines how radical and incremental innovation mediate the effects of MO, EO and TO on firm performance. Finally, this is one of the few studies to look at all of these factors simultaneously and to include the two-part view of MO.",2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/MD-04-2015-0146,WOS,Journal

The authors examine the developed markets of Australia, New Zealand and the UK to better understand: how high-level audit technology has started to become embedded into existing audit spaces and any emerging issues this technology has created for the audit profession. Design/methodology/approach Through the theoretical lens of the socio-technical (ST) systems of innovation theory, the present study involved semi-structured interviews with 25 stakeholders in Australia and New Zealand from 2019 to 2020 and 21 stakeholders in the UK from 2016 to 2018. Findings Advancements are revitalizing the technologies of not only the external auditors and their firms but also of their audit clients. Although the audit model is changing, external auditors are reported to be reluctant to fully engage with new audit technologies. In this setting, the authors find audit rules are yet to become embedded in the objects or practices of ST systems and that keeping up with the pace of change for regulators and standard setters is a major challenge. Practical implications The findings of this study raise call for regulators to be more up to speed with these new technological changes, as audit standards need to be amended accordingly. Although the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board deliberates, both clients and auditors need to lobby for specific audit data analytics regulations.

In this paper, the authors are particularly interested in advanced three-dimensional design packages such as Inventor and SolidWorks, interactive mathematical and simulation environments such as Matlab, Simulink, Simscape Multibody and Robot Operating System, and several application development languages such as C# and Python. A few of them will be used throughout the paper in a collection of examples that use the new Kassow 810 collaborative robot as a test-case demonstration. In the process, the authors expect readers to fully understand how to use all these tools to other machines and to their own designs. Design/methodology/approach Consequently, the paper follows a step-by-step practical procedure, fully tested and explained using the already mentioned state-of-the-art collaborative robot, guiding the reader from the design, modeling, simulation and application development phases, which may be applied to other machines and robotic designs.

The early identification of future high-cost patients with COPD may decrease healthcare spending by informing individualized interventions that prevent exacerbation events and decelerate disease progression. Existing studies of cost prediction of other chronic diseases have applied regression and machine-learning methods that cannot capture the complex causal relationships between COPD factors. Thus, the exploration of these factors through nonlinear, high-dimensional but explainable modeling is greatly needed. Objectives: We aimed to develop a machine-learning model to identify future high-cost patients with COPD. Such a model should incorporate expert knowledge about causal relationships, and the method for estimating the model could provide more accurate predictions than other machine learning methods. Methods: We used the 2011â€“2013 medical insurance data of patients with COPD in a large city. The data set included demographic information and admission records. Leveraging on developments in graphical modeling methods, we proposed a smooth Bayesian network (SBN) model for the prediction of high-cost individuals using medical insurance data. The modeling method incorporated some expert knowledge about causal relationships (i.e., about the Bayesian network structure). We employed a smoothing kernel based on the weighted nearest neighborhood method in the SBN model to address overfitting, case-mix effect, and data sparsity (i.e., using data about â€œsimilar patientsâ€). Results: The proposed SBN achieved the area under curve (AUC) of 0.80 and showed considerable improvement over the baseline machine-learning methods. Besides confirming the known factors from the literature, we found â€œregionâ€ (i.e., a suburban or urban area) to be a significant factor, and that in a 3-tier system with primary, secondary and tertiary hospitals, COPD patients who had been admitted to primary hospitals were more likely to develop into future high-cost patients than patients who had been admitted to tertiary hospitals. Conclusion: The proposed SBN model not only obtained higher prediction accuracy and stronger generalizability than a number of benchmark machine-learning methods, but also used the Bayesian network to capture the complex causal relationships between different predictors by incorporating expert knowledge. Furthermore, a framework was developed to establish the relationships between exposure to historical trajectory and future outcome, which can also be applied to other temporal data to model different trajectory information and predict other outcomes.

To that end, it is necessary to count on governance mechanisms that ensure the alignment between the knowledge resources and processes and the business strategy. Given that knowledge management is often performed by project management offices (PMOs), the purpose of this paper is to explore if the dimensions for PMOs governance suggested in the literature are also valid for knowledge governance and what problems do exist.

This project brings together most of the elements that can be found in current organizational contexts (e.g. geographical dispersed project teams, multicultural environment, technical complexity, etc.), thus reinforcing the applicability of the results obtained. Findings The study findings indicate that knowledge flows between PMOs take place along the dimensions defined for PMO governance, thus confirming the suitability of those dimensions also for the governance of knowledge. This research also validates the connection between the barriers to knowledge sharing and the knowledge governance mechanisms, and provides empirical evidence of the importance of informal knowledge governance to foster knowledge sharing behaviors. This is of key importance to overcome daily operational issues. The observations made are, in fact, valuable lessons learnt for future projects and a valuable input for further research.

This study is an answer to a call on which leadership approach and mediating factors can meet today's seemingly contradictory challenges of efficiently managing business demands, while simultaneously searching for new opportunities. Design/methodology/approach The researchers analysed 1,204 usable survey responses from employees of South African organisations. Analysis was in the form of structural equation modelling. Mediation analysis was carried out on estimates of the indirect effect. Findings Results show that complexity leadership was a strong predictor of innovation climate; in turn, innovation climate positively impacts exploratory innovation by 64 per cent; complexity leadership and innovation climate positively affect exploitation by 57 per cent. The innovation climate plays a total mediator role between complexity leadership and exploratory innovation and a partial effect on exploitation. Originality/value The authors' contribution includes a theoretical contribution to the emerging field of complexity leadership by offering conceptual as well as empirical evidence of its role in ambidexterity. This study extends previous research in highlighting organisational climate's mediating role of being open to new ideas to enable exploratory innovation.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/PR-11-2018-0445,WOS,Journal

(2020),Supply chain sustainability trajectories: learning through sustainability initiatives,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT,,10.1108/IJOPM-01-2020-0043,"Purpose This paper explores how organizational capabilities and path dependence affect the implementation of supply chain (SC) sustainability initiatives. Through the lenses of contingency and evolutionary theory, the paper addresses the underexplored supply chain dynamics that enhance or inhibit sustainability trajectories. Design/methodology/approach Using in-depth multi-case studies for theory elaboration, five supply chains were studied through open-ended interviews with SC members, secondary data collection and site visit observation. The design consists of a combination of deductive and inductive approaches to elaborate theory on supply chain dynamics and enhanced sustainability trajectories. Findings The empirical study shows that learning is a fundamental condition for supply chains as they implement sustainability initiatives, and that exploitation capabilities are more frequently used than exploration capabilities. Path dependence plays a role in the outcomes of supply chain sustainability initiatives, which are influenced by both path dependence and contingencies of the contexts in which these systems operate. Research limitations/implications This paper puts forward five propositions that emerge from the literature and from the field study results. Although this is an exploratory research bounded by geographical limitations and the limited number of SC cases, the goal of elaborating theory may open up several promising avenues for future large-scale and longitudinal research studies. Practical implications By enhancing our understanding of the dynamics of supply chain sustainability trajectories, decision-makers, scholars and policy-makers can better understand how supply chains learn, how they employ SC member capabilities and how they deal with stakeholder resistance. Originality/value This paper extends supply chain sustainability theory by addressing the knowledge gap that exists with regard to understanding the dynamics of evolving supply chain sustainability trajectories. This paper sheds additional light on this important topic and contributes in multiple ways to the sustainable supply chain management literature.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJOPM-01-2020-0043,WOS,Journal

Empirical analysis based on spatial Durbin model and dynamic threshold model,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,,10.1007/s11356-022-20143-y,"Achieving carbon peak and carbon neutrality is an inherent requirement for countries to promote green recovery and transformation of the global economy after the COVID-19 pandemic. As a smoke-free industry, producer services agglomeration (PSA) may have significant impacts on CO2 emission reduction. Therefore, based on the nightlight data to calculate the CO2 emissions of 268 cities in China from 2005 to 2017, this study deeply explores the impact and transmission mechanism of PSA on CO2 emissions by constructing dynamic spatial Durbin model and intermediary effect model. Furthermore, the dynamic threshold model is used to analyze the nonlinear characteristics between PSA and CO2 emissions under different degrees of government intervention. The results reveal that: (1) Generally, China's CO2 emissions are path-dependent in the time dimension, showing a snowball effect. PSA significantly inhibits CO2 emissions, but heterogeneous influences exist in different regions, time nodes, and sub-industries; (2) PSA can indirectly curb CO2 emissions through economies of scale, technological innovation, and industrial structure upgrading. (3) The impact of PSA on China's CO2 emissions has an obvious double threshold effect under different degree of government intervention. Accordingly, the Chinese government should increase the support for producer services, dynamically adjust industrial policies, take a moderate intervention, and strengthen market-oriented reform to reduce CO2 emissions. This study opens up a new path for the low-carbon economic development and environmental sustainability, and also fills in the theoretical gaps on these issues. The findings and implications will offer instructive guideline for early achieving carbon peak and carbon neutrality.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-20143-y,WOS,Journal

(2019),The impacts of organizational learning capacities on relationship-specific innovations Evidence from the global buyer-supplier relationship,INTERNATIONAL MARKETING REVIEW,,10.1108/IMR-07-2017-0130,"Purpose Organizational learning is a critical factor in generating firm innovation. While the firms are working with global business partners, not only does their absorptive learning capacity (ALC) with business partners play an important role in generating innovation from the inter-partner firm relationship, but their joint learning capacity (JLC) does as well. However, little research has simultaneously examined absorptive and JLC on innovation in global supply chain relationships. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on the knowledge-based view, inter-partner learning theory and resource dependence theory, the current study investigates the effects of two organizational learning capacities on relationship-specific innovation: ALC (firm-level) and JLC (relationship level). In addition, a firm's focus on exploitation/exploration strategy and supplier dependence is further incorporated into the study as moderators. Moreover, solutions to endogeneity issues are discussed and reported due to the usage of survey data. The model of this study was tested using data collected from 190 electronics firms in Taiwan as an emerging market. Findings The findings of this research reveal that JLC in the presence of absorptive capacity positively influences relationship-specific innovation. Furthermore, the exploitation focus of a firm positively moderates the effects of both absorptive and JLC on relationship-specific innovation. However, supplier dependence negatively moderates the effect of JLC. Research limitations/implications - The research provides some theoretical implications for learning and innovation generation in global supply chains. Practical implications - The paper provides some managerial implications for how to manage innovations in the global supply chain relationships.

An ecosystem approach to aquaculture (EAA) has been recommended to facilitate socially and environmentally sustainable development, yet there remains a need to better involve people in planning and operational aspects. Community-based management may help to implement principles of the EAA; however, context-specific research is needed to understand its potential application and suitability. This research explores opportunities for community-based marine aquaculture (CBMA) for nonfinfish in the context of Nova Scotia, Canada, through a series of stakeholder interviews. Results suggest that all stakeholder groups interviewed were positive about the potential for CBMA to support sustainable aquaculture growth in the province; however, key questions around operationalizing CBMA remain. The aquaculture industry is on a continual path for growth worldwide and, therefore, it becomes increasingly important to proactively examine strategies such as CBMA that can help to facilitate EAA in a way that genuinely puts people at the centre of aquaculture development and governance.

In doing this, the tourism and hospitality businesses have also emerged as an industry that has shown tremendous economic positive outputs and support to an economy with the lease inputs. However, tourism has also been reported to lead to increased environmental degradation as foreigners came to the host country, whereby ecological innovation emerged as a potential solution for eliminating the level of carbon emissions. In contrast, researchers are in agreement in terms of its beneficial relationship. Therefore, based on Turkey as the contextual gap and the application of quantile autoregressive distributed lag (QARDL) as the methodological contribution, the present study explores the relationship of tourism and ecological innovation within the framework of Environment Kuznets Curve (EKC) on the environment using two different proxies (carbon emissions and ecological footprint) spanning from 1995 to 2018. The results confirm the EKC curve whereby the parameter estimating tourism and ecological innovation on carbon emissions and ecological footprint, both of the integrations are found negative and statistically significant across most quantiles. Based on the findings, the study is accordingly concluded, followed by the managerial implications.

Furthermore the Australian fashion sector has some unique supply chain complications of geographical distances, sparse population and fragmentation in processing and manufacturing. This research aims to examine how Australian fashion small to medium enterprises (SMEs) are overcoming these challenges to run fashion businesses built around core principles of product stewardship (PS) and circularity. Design/methodology/approach: SMEs make up 88% of the Australian apparel manufacturing sector. This qualitative exploratory study included in-depth interviews with three Australian fashion SMEs engaged in circular design practice, and a focus group of 10 Western Australian fashion advocates of sustainability. Analytic coding and analysis of the data developed eight distinct themes. Findings: This study examines the barriers to circular economy (CE) that exist in the Australian fashion sector, and maps the practice of Australian SMEs with circular business models in overcoming these barriers. In CE innovation, Australian SMEs may have an advantage over larger fashion companies with more unwieldy structures. Employing design-thinking strategies, Australian SMEs with a foundation of PS and circular purpose are creating new systems of viable closed-loop business models and design processes. Originality/value: The themes from this research contribute to the limited literature on circular innovation examples that link CE theory with practice in the fashion sector. The model for circularity maps the practice of three SMEs built around core principles of PS and circularity in overcoming the barriers to CE in an Australian context, and may be used as a visual tool in education and understanding.

This conceptual inquiry focuses on the special characteristics of teams and teamwork, and how those can afford dynamic potential for achieving ambidexterity. Teams intrinsically function dynamically as integrative adaptive systems. Teams hold unique advantages for sensing and seizing new opportunities, and for reallocating taskwork and reconfiguring resources. Such advantages enable teams to more effectively align and balance exploration and exploitation for sustained innovation and successful adaptation. This inquiry draws from existing studies of dynamic capabilities and ambidexterity, and integrates that research with the well-established literature on teams and teamwork. This study examines the key processes and dynamics of team ambidexterity. The study synthesizes, and proposes a systems mod& that indicates team-centric mechanisms and dynamic linkages by which ambidexterity can operate as dynamic capabilities within teams. The analysis and model add to the development of organizational change theory and orients future studies of ambidexterity at meso level. This inquiry also benefits organizational leaders by providing valuable insights and practical took for developing, leading, and supporting teams that can perform effectively under turbulent conditions. MAD statement Ambidexterity achieved through organizational teams represents dynamic potential for sustainable innovation, longterm adaptation and competitive advantage in response to rapidly changing conditions. This inquiry addresses how leaders of teams and team-based structures can enable key mechanisms and linkages for developing and engaging ambidexterity that operates as dynamic capabilities at team level. The study especially emphasizes the importance of specific mechanisms and linkages that specially characterize teams as complex adaptive systems.

The adaptive cycle framework may help explain change and the long term dynamics and resilience in supply chain networks. Adaptive cycles assume that dynamic systems such as supply chain networks go through stages of growth, development, collapse and reorientation. Adaptive cycles suggest that the resilience of a complex adaptive system such as supply chains are not fixed but expand and contract over time and resilience requires such systems to navigate each of the cycles' four stages successfully. Design/methodology/approach This research uses the adaptive cycle framework to explain supply chain resilience (SCRES). It explores the phases of the adaptive cycle, its pathologies and key properties and links these to competences and behaviors that are important for system and SCRES. The study develops a conceptual framework linking adaptive cycles to SCRES. The goal is to extend dynamic theories of SCRES by borrowing from the adaptive cycle framework. We review the literature on the adaptive cycle framework, its properties and link these to SCRES. Findings The key insight is that the adaptive cycle concept can broaden our understanding of SCRES beyond focal scales, including cross-scale resilience. As a framework, the adaptive cycle can explain the mechanisms that support or prevent resilience in supply chains. Adaptive cycles may also give us new insights into the sort of competences required to avoid stagnation, promote system renewal as resilience expands and contracts over time. Research limitations/implications The adaptive cycle may move our discussion of resilience beyond engineering and ecological resilience to include evolutionary resilience. While the first two presently dominates our theorizing on SCRES, evolutionary resilience may be more insightful than both are. Adaptive cycles capture the idea of change, adaptation and transformation and allow us to explore cross-scale resilience. Practical implications Knowing how to prepare for and overcoming key pathologies associated with each stage of the adaptive cycle can broaden our repertoire of strategies for managing SCRES across time. Human agency is important for preventing systems from crossing critical thresholds into imminent collapse. More importantly, disruptions may present an opportunity for innovation and renewal for building more resilience supply chains. Originality/value This research is one of the few studies that have applied the adaptive cycle concept to SCRES and extends our understanding of the dynamic structure of SCRES",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJLM-01-2020-0019,WOS,Journal

The approach proposed is based on the concept that OERs co-creation process can be itself part of a leaning path that allow learners to drive and design their own learning.

The demand for changes in learning from education and the market results in the creation of new educational practices such as Project-Based Learning (PBL). In this way, the emergence of new education practices aims to a greater retention of knowledge in the long term and a greater attractiveness of the content studied by the discipline. The objective of this article therefore is to present an application of the PSP4 discipline in the context of the PBL approach under the lens of the knowledge spiral. This is an exploratory research through a case study. The object of study was the discipline Production Systems Project 4 (PSP4), discipline of the 7th period of the undergraduate course in production engineering at the University of BrasÃ­lia. The results show that the PSP4 discipline fulfills the core principles of theoretical learning in project-based learning, driving knowledge retention from the use of more mechanisms and conversions of knowledge than traditional teaching. In comparison to traditional teaching-conversions from externalization and internalization, the PBL also presented mechanisms of the conversions from the socialization and combination, completing the knowledge spiral.

This research paper inquires on the influence that Industry 4.0 technologies might have on the adoption of more sophisticated business models by seaports, and the mechanisms through which this influence is driven: in particular the role that technology push and market pull mechanisms might play. To this end, it develops a conceptual model that aims to provide an explanation of the relationship between the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies and the evolution of seaports' business models.

Design/methodology/approach The authors used an online survey to test the hypotheses. Data was collected in three waves from 74 supervisors and 349 paired employees in China. Findings Job complexity had a positive association with employees' feedback-seeking, which further linked to employee creativity. This indirect effect was stronger in work teams with leaders endorsing a growth creative mindset. Practical implications Job complexity has become prevalent in organizations today. Taking daily complexity as a resource for nurturing employee creativity may balance organizations' costs on formal training and give them more initiatives in long-term development. In addition, as the growth creative mindset is relatively easy to assess and change, it may bring insights in terms of creativity development.

Parallel to the learning strategy need is an emerging need for students to understand the role of sustainability in infrastructure design. Intertwining these two areas with a service learning case study on sustainable infrastructure design provides learners with access to modeling of practitioner's ability to apply new knowledge in real time. This study reports on a pilot semester-long project, in which students develop learning skills, with a focus on sustainability by working with a non-profit developer to document Envision credits for a transit-based development. In this case study, weaving learning theory, sustainable infrastructure design and service learning together provides students with 1. access to tools for identifying new knowledge needed, 2. an understanding of the complexities of sustainable infrastructure design and 3. a service learning opportunity with a non-profit developer. The Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure (ISI) Envision rating system is used as the mechanism for providing the service learning partner with an infrastructure sustainability rating and students with access to the design professional experience. The purpose of this research is to add to the literature on students' ability to identify and use learning strategies, specifically within the context of a sustainability rating tool and service learning situation. A mixed methods research approach is used for assessment. Specifically, mechanisms used for assessing students' ability to identify new knowledge needed and appropriate learning strategies are based on 1. Ability of learners to apply new knowledge to ISI Envision credit ratings, 2. student motivation metrics which are linked to students' ability to employ learning strategies and 3. student reflective observation and conceptualization on their own ability to apply new knowledge.

Furthermore the Australian fashion sector has some unique supply chain complications of geographical distances, sparse population and fragmentation in processing and manufacturing. This research aims to examine how Australian fashion small to medium enterprises (SMEs) are overcoming these challenges to run fashion businesses built around core principles of product stewardship (PS) and circularity. Design/methodology/approach SMEs make up 88% of the Australian apparel manufacturing sector. This qualitative exploratory study included in-depth interviews with three Australian fashion SMEs engaged in circular design practice, and a focus group of 10 Western Australian fashion advocates of sustainability.

Findings This study examines the barriers to circular economy (CE) that exist in the Australian fashion sector, and maps the practice of Australian SMEs with circular business models in overcoming these barriers. In CE innovation, Australian SMEs may have an advantage over larger fashion companies with more unwieldy structures. Employing design-thinking strategies, Australian SMEs with a foundation of PS and circular purpose are creating new systems of viable closed-loop business models and design processes.

We argue that entrepreneurial bricolage, the repurposing of resources at hand, can empower resource-constrained firms to solve problems related to eco-innovation in emerging markets. Entrepreneurial bricolage theory provides the foundation for our hypothesis that the primary outcomes of entrepreneurial bricolage are institutional leverage capability (resource mobilization) and compositional capability (resource integration), which in turn affect ecoproduct, eco-process, and eco-management innovation. Based on the findings of a survey of 412 firms in the year 2016 in China, we test the postulated model using partial least squares structural equation modeling. The results show that entrepreneurial bricolage drives eco-process and eco-product innovation mainly through compositional capability, but drives eco-management innovation through both compositional capability and institutional leverage capability. This is the first attempt to explore the role of entrepreneurial bricolage in the eco-innovation of resource-constrained firms, and its findings provide recommendations for enhancing firm-specific capabilities to facilitate eco-innovation in emerging markets.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.technovation.2022.102517,WOS,Journal

Deep learning based methods of WM tract segmentation have been proposed, which greatly improve the accuracy of the segmentation. However, the training of the deep networks usually requires a large number of manual delineations of WM tracts, which can be especially difficult to obtain and unavailable in many scenarios. Therefore, in this work, we explore how to perform deep learning based WM tract segmentation when annotated training data is scarce. To this end, we seek to exploit the abundant unannotated dMRI data in the self-supervised learning framework. From the unannotated data, knowledge about image context can be learned with pretext tasks that do not require manual annotations. Specifically, a deep network can be pretrained for the pretext task, and the knowledge learned from the pretext task is then transferred to the subsequent WM tract segmentation task with only a small number of annotated scans via fine-tuning. We explore two designs of pretext tasks that are related to WM tracts. The first pretext task predicts the density map of fiber streamlines, which are representations of generic WM pathways, and the training data can be obtained automatically with tractography. The second pretext task learns to mimic the results of registration-based WM tract segmentation, which, although inaccurate, is more relevant to WM tract segmentation and provides a good target for learning context knowledge. Then, we combine the two pretext tasks and develop a nested self-supervised learning strategy. In the nested self-supervised learning strategy, the first pretext task provides initial knowledge for the second pretext task, and the knowledge learned from the second pretext task with the initial knowledge is transferred to the target WM tract segmentation task via fine-tuning. To evaluate the proposed method, experiments were performed on brain dMRI scans from the Human Connectome Project dataset with various experimental settings. The results show that the proposed method improves the performance of WM tract segmentation when tract annotations are scarce.

These drivers have led to several modifications in work practices. For example, in the future many routine tasks will be automated, resulting in workers having to undertake increasingly complex job roles, with teams in geographically dispersed areas (Barnes, S.-A. and Brown, A.

A debate about whether a smart city is a pragmatic solution for modern challenges or just a technology-led urban utopia is entangled with the vexed issue of governance. While 'smart governance' has drawn unprecedented interest, the combination of its conceptual vagueness and broad applications couple with a lack of focus on its underlying international and local political paradigms have raised concerns about its utility.

This paper explores the intellectual connection between governance and smart cities, from both an empirical and a conceptual/analytical perspective. From the empirical side, we examine which actors, processes, and relational mechanisms at different levels that have had an impact on the initiation of smart cities in three Norwegian cities: Trondheim, Bergen, and Bodo.

Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the setup, design, facilities, and strategic priorities of leading United Kingdom and United States health care innovation centers to identify transferable lessons for accelerating their creation and maximizing their impact. Methods: We conducted qualitative case studies consisting of semistructured, audio-recorded interviews with decision makers and center staff in 6 innovation centers. We also conducted nonparticipant observations of meetings and center tours, where we took field notes. Qualitative data were analyzed initially within and then across cases facilitated by QSR Internationalâ€™s NVivo software. Results: The centers had different institutional arrangements, including university-associated institutes or innovation laboratories, business accelerators or incubators, and academic health science partnership models. We conducted interviews with 34 individuals, 1 group interview with 3 participants, and observations of 4 meetings. Although the centers differed significantly in relation to their mission, structure, and governance, we observed key common characteristics. These included high-level leadership support and incentives to engage in innovation activities, a clear mission to address identified gaps within their respective organizational and health system settings, physical spaces that facilitated networking through open-door policies, flat managerial structures characterized by new organizational roles for which boundary spanning was key, and a wider innovation ecosystem that was strategically and proactively engaged with the center facilitating external partnerships. Conclusions: Although innovation in health care settings is unpredictable, we offer insights that may help those establishing innovation centers. The key in this respect is the ability to support different kinds of innovations at different stages through adequate support structures, including the development of new career pathways.

Further, ANSI/UL 4600 recognizes that continued safety is even more important than one-time initial approval/acceptance, especially for learning systems used in problem-solving Artificial Intelligence (AI). Functional transformations of learning systems are continuously monitored by OEMs. Continued airworthiness could be assessed using this method even though the system is presumably fielded with unknown risks due to new and novel technology. â€¢ Modernization of Regulatory Approaches: This methodology supports performance-based regulations with compliance required to enforce system-of-systems interoperability.

In particular, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of staff engagement as a facilitator of staff-led value co-creation. Design/methodology/approach - A new conceptual framework develops a model of staff-led value-creation, using three types of staff-led co-creation. A quantitative approach is used. Survey collection yielded a sample of 1,165 employees in an Australian not-for-profit context across 19 organizations. AMOS structural equation modeling analyzes the data. Findings - A major finding is the nexus between staff engagement and staff-led value co-creation. The nexus applies for three types of staff-led co-creation and three staff categories. Different explanatory mechanisms apply to each type of staff-led value co-creation. Research limitations/implications - The not-for-profit context may not generalize to the for-profit sector, but future research could clarify this matter. Practical implications - The results can inform organizations wishing to create greater service contributions through greater staff participation, which can include a staff-initiating (staff-led) role. Different value co-creation targets require different corporate triggers, reflecting the different explanatory mechanisms of each co-creation type. Social implications - Not-for-profit context ensures major social implications. Originality/value - The emphasis on staff-led value co-creation augments the customer-led co-creation literature.

However little is known about the moderating effects of a firm's approach to innovation and capability of marketing orientation that influence this aforementioned relationship and the underlying mechanisms. This paper aims to examine how ambidextrous innovation (exploration and exploitation innovation) and market orientation capabilities (market-sensing and customer-linking capabilities) can shape the relationship between service innovation and firm performance. Research model was developed based on theoretical foundation of the resource-based view and the rationed perspective. Design/methodology/approach - Using an original data set comprising 170 service-oriented firms from Taiwan, the authors found that ambidextrous innovation and market orientation capabilities can significantly enhance performance for service-oriented firms. The authors used the traditional ordinary least squares regression and the zero-inflated Poisson regression to test the five hypotheses. Findings - The empirical results fully support the hypotheses that ambidextrous innovation and market orientation capabilities can significantly enhance firm performance. These results imply that the benefits of ambidextrous innovation and market orientation capabilities can coexist in a service innovation deployment and that these combined benefit firm performance. Originality/value - The ambidextrous innovation and market orientation capabilities play catalytic roles during innovative service implementation in the service-oriented sectors. The roles of these factors have rarely been examined together before. Hence, this study addresses the gaps in current understanding and provides valuable insights, particularly in the context of the future service innovation deployment. In addition, the theoretical and managerial implications of the findings provide useful and valuable information for both the researchers and managers of the service-oriented.",2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/CMS-03-2017-0045,WOS,Journal

Despite the efforts of local governments to obtain broad and representative input through community engagement processes, communities feel they have limited influence on decision-making processes. Further, Australian trust indices show declining levels of trust between the community, government and large institutions. So how can better community engagement practice be cultivated, evidenced, and continue to evolve to respond in increasingly complex contexts? Presenting a case study in the Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia, this article explores how a local government organisation is developing an innovative model of excellence in community engagement in collaboration with a regional university. Grounded in a place-based approach to community engagement, the innovation of this emerging model couples futures studies approaches to co-design locally appropriate responses to navigate increasing uncertainty and change.

In light of this, this study aims to explore the influence of supply chain knowledge, non-supply chain learning and corporate reputation on green innovation. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a quantitative research approach where data is gathered from managers of 208 small and medium enterprises in Ghana using survey questionnaires.

Findings The findings reveal supply chain knowledge relates positively with non-supply chain learning, corporate reputation and green innovation. Corporate reputation also impacts green innovation positively and provides partial mediation effect between supply chain knowledge and green innovation.

This elusiveness stems from the difficulty of introducing changes into complex ecosystems. Program evaluation models that focus on implementation fidelity examine the inner workings of an innovation in the real-world context. However, the methods by which fidelity is typically examined may inadvertently limit thinking about the trajectory of an innovation over time. Thus, a new approach is needed, one that focuses on whether the conditions observed during the implementation phase of an educational innovation represent a foundation for meaningful, long-lasting change. Method Through a critical review, authors examined relevant models from implementation science and developed a comprehensive framework that shifts the focus of program evaluation from exploring snapshots in time to assessing the trajectory of an innovation beyond the implementation phase. Results Durable and meaningful normalization of an innovation is rooted in how the local aspirations and practices of the institutional system and the people doing the work interact with the grand aspirations and features of the innovation. Borrowing from Normalization Process Theory, the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, and Reflexive Monitoring in Action, the authors developed a framework, called EcoNormalization, that highlights 6 critical questions to be considered when evaluating the potential longevity of an innovation.

Nevertheless, few studies have been conducted to examine their impact on maritime firms' performance. Drawing on organizational learning theory, this study investigates the effect of maritime knowledge clusters on the constituent maritime firms' performance. A conceptual model was proposed and examined using survey data collected from shipping professionals in Singapore. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling were employed as the data analysis approach. The results show that the positive relationship between maritime knowledge clusters and maritime firms' performance is fully mediated by the firms' social capital and absorptive capacity in a sequential manner. This indicates that maritime firms should focus on strengthening not only their social capital but also absorptive capacity so as to fully enjoy the benefits brought about by maritime knowledge clusters. In addition, regulators should endeavor to develop global linkage, global systemic mechanisms and local knowledge clusters to facilitate organizational learning of the constituent maritime firms.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104472,WOS,Journal

(2020),Developing young children's empathic perception through digitally mediated interpersonal experience: Principles for a hybrid design of empathy games,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,,10.1111/bjet.12918,"There is an emerging concern that modern technology-saturated environments, particularly computer games, are inhibiting the development of children's empathic behaviour and social skills. We argue that the solution is embedded in the problem when hybrid learning design blends real-life social interpersonal interactions with digital representations. We present theory-informed design principles for creating tablet games with a focus on promoting empathic perception-a building block for the ability to see, sense and understand other's internal states. Based on these principles, the game Empathy World was developed and trialled in a naturalistic three-month study in an early childhood education setting. Children learned to perceive empathy-worthy cues in various scenes and interacted with the tablet game to further their perspective-taking and to associate emotions with social contexts. The findings from this study show an increase in the selective tendency of children's in-game perception of empathy-worthy stimuli and enhanced empathic concern. We argue that future design for learning can utilise the strengths of hybrid design for social development at a larger scale: integrating theoretically informed and rigorously tested digital tools in existing educational and social environments. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Research has examined various developmental benefits of empathy and shown that empathy can be learnt. Digital games can be productive, easy to scale, tools that support learning. Sound design, based on theory-informed principles, can improve the effectiveness of digital learning games. What this paper adds It synthesises theories and research evidence of empathy and its development. It shows how empathy-related theoretical ideas and evidence were translated into hybrid design principles for developing empathy games and embedding them into children's social learning environment. It illustrates how theory- and evidence-informed design principles were used to create a digital game to enhance empathic learning of young children in a hybrid technology-mediated environment. It explores and validates the effectiveness of a hybrid design approach by implementing the digital empathy game in children's natural learning environment and analysing the data by capturing emerging patterns of development stemming from gameplay. Implications for practice and/or policy Pre-schools could enhance children's empathy learning by integrating specially designed empathy games in existing learning environments. Teachers and parents should be informed about how to create game-mediated hybrid environments that enhance children's empathy.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bjet.12918,WOS,Journal

Current approaches extract travel information once the travel is complete. Such approaches are limited in terms of generating just-in-time information for a number of mobility based applications, e.g., real time mode specific patronage estimation. In order to detect the transport modalities from GPS trajectories, various machine learning approaches have already been explored. However, the majority of them produce only a single conclusion from a given set of evidences, ignoring the uncertainty of any mode classification. Also, the existing machine learning approaches fall short in explaining their reasoning scheme. In contrast, a fuzzy expert system can explain its reasoning scheme in a human readable format along with a provision of inferring different outcome possibilities, but lacks the adaptivity and learning ability of machine learning. In this paper, a novel hybrid knowledge driven framework is developed by integrating a fuzzy logic and a neural network to complement each other's limitations. Thus the aim of this paper is to automate the tuning process in order to generate an intelligent hybrid model that can perform effectively in near-real time mode detection using GPS trajectory. Tests demonstrate that a hybrid knowledge driven model works better than a purely knowledge driven model and at per the machine learning models in the context of transport mode detection.",2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi5110207,WOS,Journal

What stands before us today is a world far from the simple recipes of classical industrial culture: it is a complex world in which high technology plays at re-combining itself into the most diverse of forms, with mature technologies as much as with refined forms of artisanal production. The expected homogenisation of productive models has left room for an explosion of variety. The competitive value of businesses is ever more linked to their ability, enclosed within design action, to integrate codifiable and transferable knowledge with that which is tacit and contextual [1] [2]. Interdisciplinary knowledge becomes the qualitative and operational parameter capable of interpreting and guiding new production and consumer scenarios along local and global paths. Non-linear paths, let it be clear. Singular adventures, where a multidimensional thought supports that game played between clarity and obscurity that is complexity itself [3]. Within this framework, the purpose of higher education must tackle the formation of theoretical knowledge and that of operational knowledge and be capable of weaving a different kind of dialogue between educational contexts and productive realities. In design education, attention is focused back onto the relationships between basic and specialist knowledge, between knowledge and skill, between high-culture technical and scientific information and the know-how that can be applied directly in the professional world. And the learning methods themselves are based on these. With regards to this, the present paper describes the structure, format and contents planned and developed in view of the Fashion Retail Design Studio Course held within the context of the Laurea Magistrale programme (equivalent to Master of Science and hereinafter referred to as LM) dedicated to Design for the Fashion System (School of Design - Politecnico di Milano). The Course's structure, starting with a given design theme, was a chance to experiment with a workshop model in which teachers (professors, researchers and professionals) could experience the close interaction between building up knowledge and skills, with the use of different learning models within an experience-based context. The disciplinary standpoint is that of Retail Design and the area is that of Design for the fashion product-system. Retail Design is characterised as a field with a strong directorial capacity of bringing together and integrating skills - just as an example, those concerning interior and service design, communication design, set, exhibit design and management -. This integration is reflected in the educational project both with regards to the contents and the organisation of the design workshop. The course is divided into 4 sequential learning moments, pursued in line with varying pedagogical models, all interdependent and focused on exploring different aspects of the same design field.",2019,,WOS,Conference Paper

Design/methodology/approach â€“ An exploratory mixed-method design was followed for the purposes of the project. During the first qualitative phase, a historical timeline of the focal system was created. In the quantitative phase, the resilience assessment guided the investigation. To collect data, the case study research strategy included a heuristic process of collecting and reviewing documents, semi-structured interviews, observations and the systematic implementation of the resilience assessment approach. Findings â€“ Based on the resilience assessment approach, it is argued that the environmental status of university campuses can be considered relevant to the local community and immediate environment. Knowledge of the finite resources and their capacity in the context of the social-ecological system may increase the resilience of a campus. Originality/value â€“ This research study explores the use of an alternative approach to environmental practices at university campuses. The resilience assessment is usually performed on large ecosystems. By applying this approach to a small ecosystem, the study fills a gap in the applicability of the resilience approach.

It studies transformational leadership and innovation at the organizational level and creativity at the individual level. Design/methodology/approach A theoretical model was created, which entailed the development of variables and hypotheses. A survey instrument was used to obtain data, through a self-completion questionnaire. The final sample was made up of 503 individuals, recruited using a random sampling technique. Findings The results showed that transformational leadership has a significant positive relationship with both followers' creativity and organizational innovation. Furthermore, a significant positive relationship was found between followers' creativity and organizational innovation. In addition, the relationship between transformational leadership and followers' creativity, through the mediating role of employees' psychological empowerment, support for innovation, workplace relationships and employee learning, was also found to be both positive and significant. However, the data showed that intrinsic motivation does not significantly affect the relationship between transformational leadership and creativity. Practical implications - The study provides guidance to organizations that need to change their leadership style and approach, as well as their innovation and creativity mechanisms, at a strategic level. The resulting guidance provides organizations with insight into how they can improve the creativity of their employees through motivating, supporting and inspiring them.

Although skill enhancement programs are recommended and beneficial, there is limited evidence on its influence on the clinical competence of pre-graduate nursing students. Objective This study explored the attributes of a skills enhancement program that affect the perceived clinical competence of pre-graduate nursing students. Design and Setting A cross-sectional study was conducted in a private higher education institution in the Philippines from April to May 2016. Participant and Methods A total of 245 pre-graduate nursing students participated and completed a three-part survey composed of the respondent's robotfoto, the Skills Enhancement Program Questionnaire, and the Clinical Competence Questionnaire. Factor analysis explicated the attributes of the skills enhancement program while structural equation modeling and path analysis analyzed the variables' relationship. Results Findings showed that a skills enhancement program has 4 attributes: supportive clinical instructor, comprehensive orientation, formative goals and objectives, and conducive learning environment. Although all attributes of the program positively affected clinical competence, a supportive clinical instructor had the strongest influence on all clinical competency dimensions. Conclusion A skills enhancement program that has a supportive clinical instructor, comprehensive orientation, formative goals and objectives, and conducive learning environment facilitates clinical competency development among pre-graduate nursing students. This knowledge provides momentum for nursing educators to review and refine their skills and the existing design of their skills enhancement program to further develop clinical competency among pre-graduate nursing students.

It focuses on IBM's transition from market leadership in a failed path (plasma) to leadership in the emerging dominant technology (LCD) in the 1980s. Interviews and internal documents offer two primary factors explaining renewal at IBM. First, IBM Research had a hybrid structure that captured the benefits of both centralized and decentralized R&D. Second, middle managers shaped senior management cognitive frames to focus on business-related issues instead of specific technical issues, thus bypassing biases often resulting from failure. The study offers an integrated framework on what facilitates flexibility at the technology, organization, and decision-making levels. This flexibility helps firms survive a turbulent era of ferment.Managerial summary: Firms facing technological uncertainty may need to recover from unlucky bets. But responding to failure is politically and organizationally difficult. This study explores how IBM recovered from its failed bet on plasma displays to lead the LCD display market. This study identifies six key factors, highlighting two. First, IBM's researchers received centralized funding, but could also receive funding directly from division managers. This structure helped preserve options and variety. Second, internal LCD champions focused on the business case for displays and not technology. This fostered technology agnosticism and helped avoid managerial biases from failure. For managers looking to use real options to maintain flexibility in an uncertain environment, this study offers clear suggestions related to design and decision making that can foster flexibility.

Research on circular economy in the textile sector often focuses on businesses or consumers as key enablers in circular transitions, yet it treats them as independent entities and thereby neglects the study of interactions that can provide insight at the systems level. The proclaimed circular textile mission in the Netherlands setting a national target for 100% circularity by 2050 is used as case study to address this research gap. We explore the circular textile transition processes found in the context of the Dutch mission and compare the development and interactions among various technical and non-technological solutions produced by engaged actor constellations for assessing key factors driving and blocking the overall mission fulfilment. To these ends, we derive a theoretical framework based on innovation system theory and conceptualize the Dutch circular textile transition as a Mission-oriented Innovation System (MIS). Analyzing the structure and functioning of the Dutch mission-oriented innovation system, we show that (1) there is a good match between the formal Dutch circular textile mission and system actor perceptions; (2) system actors have formed structures around three dominant solution trajectories in the Dutch system: secondhand, mechanical recycling, and chemical recycling; (3) these trajectories expose distinct key virtuous and vicious cycles, which characterize (4) the entire system as formative. Overall, the secondhand trajectory shows most developed structures and most positive dynamics, chemical recycling carries most technological breakthrough potential, whereas mechanical recycling is a mature technology but lacks market demand and supply. We compare the three solution trajectories, discuss the disruptive nature of the Dutch circular textile transition, and suggest installing Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) as a potential intervention for accelerating system transformation. The study concludes with reflections on the case learnings and considerations for further research on mission-oriented innovation systems.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bse.3114,WOS,Journal

The TPACK that inservice teachers develop is practitioner-based and can be continuously transformed with teaching experiences. In this study, we constructed video-embedded and discipline-focused questionnaires to measure science teachers' TPACK. Item sets were generic across four disciplines and designed to investigate teachers' TPACK at different levels of the cognitive process. Each questionnaire was embedded with three instructional clips in which preservice teachers demonstrated their previously-prepared lessons on selected topics in biology, chemistry, earth science, and physics. Through exploratory factor analysis, four factors (i.e., evaluation, evaluation/synthesis, application/analysis, and knowledge/comprehension) emerged from the data. The presumed hierarchical interrelationships among these cognitive processes were investigated through a path analysis. The findings indicated that teachersâ€™ TPACK at the knowledge/comprehension level made significant loadings to TPACK at higher levels, but this was not the case for application/analysis. The disconnect for application/analysis within the simple-to-complex cognitive process hierarchy suggests that it should be viewed as different from the other three constructs that incorporate more instructional reasoning. The designs for the questionnaire items and embedded instructional clips that were used to elicit teachersâ€™ practical knowledge are presented herein.

The model of this article explains how knowledge creation and team performance can be increased through the integration of social and technological factors Design/methodology/approach To empirically test the model, multi-wave and multi-source data were collected from 80 teams whose members use social media as a tool for communication and interaction. Findings The analysis results provide insights into some interesting findings. The results show transactive memory system (TMS) as an important factor that can significantly contribute to knowledge creation in teams. Especially, the TMS strengthens the significant positive effect of enterprise social media (ESM) and insignificant positive effect of knowledge complementarity on knowledge creation. Furthermore, knowledge creation is found to be a significant predictor of team performance Originality/value Much of the knowledge management literature focuses on the ways to increase the quantity of accessible knowledge to organization members. Such knowledge management studies are more relevant to knowledge exchange among individual employees, teams and organizations. However, this study takes a nuanced approach to explore how knowledge creation can be increased in teams by implementing a knowledge integration mechanism. A general model of knowledge creation is proposed, but the strength of this model lies in the moderating effect of TMS which strengthens the effect of knowledge complementarity and ESM on knowledge creation in teams which eventually increases team performance.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/ITP-10-2019-0536,WOS,Journal

The cooperative use of FES and the exoskeleton allows active muscle contractions through FES while robustifying torque generation to reduce FES-induced muscle fatigue. In this article, a switched distribution of allocation ratios between FES and electric motors in a closed-loop adaptive control design is explored for the first time. The new controller uses an iterative learning neural network (NN)-based control law to compensate for structured and unstructured parametric uncertainties in the hybrid exoskeleton model. A discrete Lyapunov-like stability analysis that uses a common energy function proves asymptotic stability for the switched system with iterative learning update laws. Five human participants, including a person with complete spinal cord injury, performed sit-to-stand tasks with the new controller. The experimental results showed that the synthesized controller, in a few iterations, reduced the root mean square error between desired positions and actual positions of the knee and hip joints by 46.20% and 53.34%, respectively. The sit-to-stand experimental results also show that the proposed NN-based iterative learning control (NNILC) approach can recover the asymptotically trajectory tracking performance despite the switching of allocation levels between FES and electric motor. Compared to a proportional-derivative controller and traditional iterative learning control, the findings showed that the new controller can potentially simplify the clinical implementation of the hybrid exoskeleton with minimal parameters tuning.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2021.3089885,WOS,Journal

Exporting SMEs from developing economies faces many challenges, including lack of knowledge about institutions in foreign markets, inadequate knowledge about foreign institutions and limited internationalization knowledge (IK). However, research on the export performance of SMEs has thus far focused on the internationalization strategies of multinational corporations. This study aims to explore the effect of foreign market knowledge on SME export performance. The authors also assessed the moderating effect of employee absorptive capacity in the knowledge-performance nexus. Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopted a survey design to collect data from owners/managers of SMEs exporters in the Greater Accra region of Ghana. A total of 350 questionnaires were distributed based on convenience. Of this number, 257 usable responses were used in the final analysis. The authors tested the proposed model using partial least squares-structural equation modeling. Findings: The findings show that the three types of foreign market knowledge tested in this study, namely, foreign institutional knowledge (FIK), foreign business knowledge and IK have positive and significant effects on SME exportersâ€™ performance. It also shows that employeesâ€™ absorptive capacity affects the relationship between FIK and SME exportersâ€™ performance. Originality/value: The study demonstrates the types of knowledge relevant to SME export performance. The study further demonstrates the moderating effect of employee absorptive capacity on the relationship between knowledge and export performance. The study advances existing knowledge on SME performance, especially from an emerging economy context.

As a result, in the literature, there is not a framework that defines the process of SV creation in IEs or which aspects should be considered for understanding it. Moving from these considerations, this paper aims to propose a conceptual model of how IEs can create SV, identifying the main building blocks of the process and the aspects that characterize these building blocks. Design/methodology/approach The authors reviewed the literature on IEs and value creation over the last 15 years, by structurally analysing 120 articles. On the basis of such review, the authors identified main dimensions of analysis focusing on the conceptualization of SV in IEs. Findings First, the authors developed a conceptual model relying on a process-based logic and framing the SV creation in terms of inputs, here intended as four key characteristics (actors, structure, governance and relations), internal processes (strategies and internal mechanisms) and outputs (the value created). Second, each element of value creation is explored, highlighting the main evidence emerging from prior studies in connection to each block. Originality/value This paper drives the identification of some relevant relationships that connect the characteristics of the IEs, the strategies and the internal mechanisms to the output of the process, i.e. the SV created.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EJIM-06-2021-0289,WOS,Journal

BIM methods, which are used as new technological tools and design modes by an increasing number of architectural firms today, have the potential to make a similar impact because they introduce a new logic Therefore, it is a critical issue to examine the change created by BIM in the design processes. In this context, this study examines the potential transformations that BIM can create in architectural design processes with a theoretical approach; It also explores the practical validity of theoretical assumptions. In line with these objectives, a three-pronged methodology was adopted in the study. First, the transformation created by BIM was conceptualized as a holistic digitalization in the field of architecture. Secondly, previous studies on BIM were examined, according to this, the possible effects of BIM on architectural design processes were gathered under three headings and the possible direction of the effects in these three areas was explained theoretically. Finally, the theoretical assumptions were reassessed through interviews with people actively working in the practical field. The inferences obtained at the end of these three stages are evaluated in the discussion section. In consequence, the paper attempts to reveal the transforming mechanism of architectural design practice under the influence of BIM as a new form of knowledge that enables the storage and management of design data. In this context, it aims to be a source for future studies on the orientations of architectural design practice and education. Â© 2022, Istanbul Teknik Universitesi, Faculty of Architecture.

GCP aims at developing drought tolerant varieties by reconciling upstream biotechnology based advanced research with the downstream development at the farmer's field. The objective of this paper is to apply the theory of Commons Based Peer Production (CBPP) to analyse the knowledge production process of GCP, especially the case of drought tolerant rice research network in Indian context (GCP-RRN). CBPP represents the theorisation of a mode of production that can be distinguished from market (private) and state (public) knowledge-production systems that was developed by observing the phenomena of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). The organisational attributes of the CBPP mode applied in computer software production include the modulation of work, small-size granularity of components, and mechanisms that integrate these modules into an end product. Socio-economically, this form of production is based on cooperation, collaboration and collective action rather than property, contract and managerial hierarchies. This paper argues that GCP-RRN knowledge production is basically a hybridised one in which there are certain inclinations towards CBPP within certain larger context, and there are other attributes too that do not fall within CBPP theorisation. Further, this paper elaborates on the implications of this hybridised model for agrarian knowledge production discourse and institutions.",2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2017.06.008,WOS,Journal

A possible solution is to synthesize datasets that reflect patterns of real ones using a two-step approach: first, a real dataset X is analyzed to derive relevant patterns Z and, then, to use such patterns for reconstructing a new dataset X ' that preserves the main characteristics of X. This survey explores two possible approaches: (1) Constraint-based generation and (2) probabilistic generative modeling. The former is devised using inverse mining (IFM) techniques, and consists of generating a dataset satisfying given support constraints on the itemsets of an input set, that are typically the frequent ones. By contrast, for the latter approach, recent developments in probabilistic generative modeling (PGM) are explored that model the generation as a sampling process from a parametric distribution, typically encoded as neural network. The two approaches are compared by providing an overview of their instantiations for the case of discrete data and discussing their pros and cons.

A significant contributor to this interpretability-adoption gap is the prevalence of black-box models and the lack of built-in methods for model interpretation. While established methods for evaluating model performance exist, an intuitive understanding of the modeling and decision-making processes in models is nonetheless desired in many cases. In this work, we demonstrate several ways of incorporating model interpretability to the structure-agnostic Compositionally Restricted Attention-Based network, CrabNet. We show that CrabNet learns meaningful, material property-specific element representations based solely on the data with no additional supervision. These element representations can then be used to explore element identity, similarity, behavior, and interactions within different chemical environments. Chemical compounds can also be uniquely represented and examined to reveal clear structures and trends within the chemical space. Additionally, visualizations of the attention mechanism can be used in conjunction to further understand the modeling process, identify potential modeling or dataset errors, and hint at further chemical insights leading to a better understanding of the phenomena governing material properties. We feel confident that the interpretability methods introduced in this work for CrabNet will be of keen interest to materials informatics researchers as well as industrial practitioners alike.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40192-021-00247-y,WOS,Journal

The technology acceptance model (TAM) concept was used to explore learning effectiveness and satisfaction. A total of 36 Senior One students from a senior high school in Kaohsiung were selected as the research subjects in two classes per week for 13 weeks. Questionnaires and qualitative interviews were used to understand the correlation between students' self-efficacy, anxiety, outcomes, and learning satisfaction with the AIOT course during the flipped learning process. The study used SmartPLS3 to analyze the measurement model and structural model, and bootstrapping to conduct the path analysis and validate the research hypotheses. Because this research provides students with relevant online teaching videos for linking and browsing in the textbooks, and the video time should not be too long, in the teaching process, small-scale online learning courses are adopted for flipped teaching, which promptly arouses students' interest and enhances their learning participation. Through the sharing of homework with each other, its content deficiencies were modified, students' anxiety in learning was reduced, and the effect of learning and thinking together was achieved; in the teaching mode, theoretical content was combined with physical and practical courses to implement cross-disciplinary. To learn, the principle of 4D double diamond design to make reciprocal corrections between curriculum planning and teaching implementation as the teaching model framework was used. The results of this study show self-efficacy has a significant positive effect on the perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of users. Learning anxiety does not significantly predict the perceived ease of use or perceived usefulness of flipped learning using online e-learning. The perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness have positive impacts on the prediction of behavioral intention in flipped teaching using online digital teaching materials.

Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) based model has gradually become the theme of knowledge-aware recommendation (KGR). However, there is a natural deficiency for GNN-based KGR models, that is, the sparse supervised signal problem, which may make their actual performance drop to some extent. Inspired by the recent success of contrastive learning in mining supervised signals from data itself, in this paper, we focus on exploring the contrastive learning in KG-aware recommendation and propose a novel multi-level cross-view contrastive learning mechanism, named MCCLK. Different from traditional contrastive learning methods which generate two graph views by uniform data augmentation schemes such as corruption or dropping, we comprehensively consider three different graph views for KG-aware recommendation, including global-level structural view, local-level collaborative and semantic views. Specifically, we consider the user-item graph as a collaborative view, the item-entity graph as a semantic view, and the user-item-entity graph as a structural view. MCCLK hence performs contrastive learning across three views on both local and global levels, mining comprehensive graph feature and structure information in a self-supervised manner. Besides, in semantic view, a k-Nearest-Neighbor (k NN) item-item semantic graph construction module is proposed, to capture the important item-item semantic relation which is usually ignored by previous work. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets show the superior performance of our proposed method over the state-of-the-arts.

In this paper, we take a broader look at the problem and formalize the concept of a complete redirected walking system. This work establishes the theoretical foundations for combining multiple redirection strategies into a unified framework known as adaptive redirection. This meta-strategy adapts based on the context, switching between a suite of strategies with a priori knowledge of their performance under the various circumstances. This paper also introduces a novel static planning strategy that optimizes gain parameters for a predetermined virtual path, known as the Combinatorially Optimized Pre-Planned Exploration Redirector (COPPER). We conducted a simulation-based experiment that demonstrates how adaptation rules can be determined empirically using machine learning, which involves partitioning the spectrum of contexts into regions according to the redirection strategy that performs best.

Abnormal behavior detection is a data analysis task that identifies interesting and emerging patterns from data. Many research in the area of abnormal behavior detection has used machine learning and deep learning techniques to classify anomaly traffic from normal traffic. However, due the massive volumes of data that need to be analyzed and the fast development of attacks, most of the existing machine learning and deep learning solutions for network intrusion detection have low accuracy and less scalability over long period of time, thus an efficient distributed deep detection method is required. In this paper, we propose a novel semi -supervised distributed approach based on stacked denoising sparse autoencoder and SVM for large-scale intrusion detection systems. Our aim is to explore the suitability of big data analytics and deep learning techniques in the context of abnormal behavior detection system. First, a distributed stacked denoising sparse autoencoder is applied to perform an unsupervised non-linear dimensionality reduction. Then, the reduced features are embed to the distributed SVM for classification. The approach is carried out using the iterative reduce paradigm based on Spark. Experimental results on four cyber security datasets including KDD Cup'99, NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15 and CICIDS2017 show that the proposed method yields promising performance and reduces the detection time.

Such technology has prompted enterprises to adjust intraorganizational boundaries to promote innovation and respond immediately to market demand. The phenomenon in which an organization adjusts its departments to promote innovation is not only a management strategy developed for improving competitiveness, but also the key to survival in the market. The information software service industry has experienced rapid advancements in technology, ever-changing operating environments, and high uncertainty. Therefore, this study targeted the information software service industry to explore how organizations in the industry punctually adjust organizational structures and resource allocation to promote innovation. In response to market demand, division of works across different departments within an organization is affected. Interdepartmental communication and negotiation have become prevalent. Organizational members use information and communications technology and the Internet to contact and interact with each other. Such behaviours lead to flat or virtual organizations and blur organizational boundaries. This study aimed to understand how Internet technology has changed organizational innovation. In academic theory, contingency theory is suitable for examining changes in organizational design in the face of environmental changes or technology evolution. Woodward (1965) applied contingency theory to reinforce conventional business models, asserting that organizational structures change under the effect of technology. Early scholars studying organizational structures have focused mostly on discussion of organizational design structures. For example, Weber (1946) claimed bureaucracy is the most reasonable and efficient organizational type. Subsequently, Burns and Stalker (1961) divided organization types into mechanistic and organic. Mechanistic organizations feature stricter bureaucracy and rigid regulations. By contrast, organic organizations allow flexible working methods. In addition to adjustment to organizational structures, the present study further referenced the research of organizational function boundary by Santos and Eisenhardt (2005), which proposed four dimensions, namely cost efficiency, autonomous power, consistency identity, and growth competence. From this perspective, the present study explored the effect of Internet technology on relevant dimensions. To further explore the effect of Internet technology on organizational boundaries, this study adopted a qualitative case interview method. The most representative information software service firms in the market were examined, including â€œBâ€ company, which is renowned for its antivirus software, and International Business Machines Corporation-Taiwan, which specializes in hardware and software integration. During long-term innovative development procedures, this study performed observations on the case firms' design of organizational boundaries and personnel interaction processes between the research and development department, which is responsible for innovation, and the information department, which is in charge of managing information and communications technology applications. The results of this study can serve as a reference for applying conventional theory regarding organizational function boundaries theory to emerging industries, thereby creating measures for coping with rapid changes in market trends brought about by Internet technology. In addition, the study results can facilitate adjustments to or further elaboration on operational definitions or research dimensions in existing theories.

Background For critical education contexts, it is important to analyze student satisfaction with blended learning as well as its effects on student performance. In the context of teaching design, there is a need for in-depth research to understand what factors determine satisfaction with blended learning and how these factors affect performance in design courses both directly and indirectly. Methodology To explore the student experiences of blended learning and its effects on the relationship between overall course satisfaction and student performance, data was collected through a survey instrument from a randomly selected 306 undergraduate students, 220 female and 86 male, each enrolled in four daytime blended learning sections of a design course. Contribution Different than other studies, this study contributes to the literature by investigating the direct and indirect effects of a blended learning environment on the relationship between overall course satisfaction and student performance in the interior architecture context, rather than solely focusing on satisfaction or performance. Findings The findings show that satisfaction with blended learning has a significant and direct influence on performance. Different than the studies in blended learning satisfaction literature, the study found blended interpretation and experience as significant contributors to impact blended learning satisfaction in design courses. Recommendations for Practitioners The findings in the study are intended to assist design instructors in improving student satisfaction of a blended design course in order to enjoy the possibilities of new information and communication technologies (ICTs) as well as to serve as a basis for developing an effective course mechanism in a blended design curriculum. Recommendations for Researchers The study focused on the mediating effect of only one variable, which was performance, but researchers could investigate more variables, such as experience, learning strategies, and retention as having mediating effects on student satisfaction in different blended learning models in design courses. Impact on Society This study emphasizes that students' satisfaction with blended learning in challenging learning environments like interior architecture provides learners with choices to develop more student-centered instruction and increased performance and engagement. Future Research It is advisable to (i) explore the blended learning behavior of international design students compared with national students and (ii) investigate potential implications of computer-mediated feedbacks on student creativity.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.28945/4122,WOS,Journal

A survey of customs officials was conducted, and data were analyzed by structural equation modelling. The outcomes discover two significant enablers related to relative advantages and the new exploring factor Culture while Finance & Human Resources and Legislation as the inhibitors. Additionally, the study also emphasized that e-customs implementation had a positive influence on firm performance in Vietnam. In addition, the study provides different viewpoints of cultural dimensions in case study of applying e-customs in Vietnam in comparison with previous studies. Culture with attributions related to uncertain acceptance and individualism encourage innovation in other literature reviews, however, the study indicates uncertainty avoidance and collectivism as Vietnam also promotes e-customs deployment. Vietnam with high power distance and short-term orientation became old themes. This emerging country switched to low distance and long-term orientation in terms of e-customs innovation. In contrast to previous studies related to constraints from technology in emerging economies, technological factors are not an obstacle for Vietnam. Furthermore, previous literature reviews inflected legislation and regulations of government as one of the limitations that should be examined in further and this research carried-out this investigation in one of emerging economies. The results of the paper support policy makers who can have essential solutions to enhance e-customs implementation as well as enterprisesâ€™ managers set-up strategy to adapt with the modernization environment.

An innovation ecosystem consists of multilateral organizations and emerges as a favorable mechanism for value co-creation and sustainable growth. Yet the theorizing of an innovation ecosystem is still at an early stage and in-depth studies from emerging economy leaders are insufficient. This study aims to investigate how an innovation ecosystem is constructed and coordinated from a core-firm based view. An exploratory single case study on the Haier Group is adopted. Through analyzing the multi-bedded units (i.e., six innovation projects/technological breakthroughs), we extract and depict Haier's innovation ecosystem and the ecological niches within it. We highlight an innovation ecosystem that promotes sustainable development and is based on complementarities in technologies and resources, while at the same time integrates non-technological issues such as strategy, culture, institution, and the market. Regarding ecosystem coordination, value appropriability should be ensured to sustain the innovation ecosystem. Moreover, we argue that the ultimate purpose of innovation ecosystem is not to facilitate the realization of one specific project, but rather to improve the overall success rate of innovations within it. This research complements and extends literature on enterprise innovation ecosystems, and provides implications as to the construction, coordination, and sustainability of innovation ecosystems for emerging economy firms.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11113108,WOS,Journal

To bridge this research gap, we draw comparisons between disruptive and incremental innovation to account for electric and hybrid vehicles, respectively. We explore the misalignment between technological growth and customer satisfaction by comparing the electric vehicle business model with the hybrid vehicle business model based on three parameters: channels, value propositions, and customer relationships. Primary empirical data are collected from 307 survey participants. Structural equation modeling is then employed to investigate the similarities and differences between electric vehicles based on their disruptive innovation and hybrid vehicles based on their incremental innovation. We find that electric vehicles' unique focus on channels leads to a positive influence on their business model and customer satisfaction, while focusing on value propositions leads to positive results for hybrid vehicles. Finally, we discuss the significance of the results considering electric vehicles' high-end encroachment strategy within the luxury segment and contrast it with the relatively low-end encroachment strategy adopted by sellers of hybrid vehicles.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2020.120520,WOS,Journal

Prior studies have focused on the ambidexterity dilemma and the need to adopt sustainable inter-organizational governance to drive I4.0 capabilities while achieving sustainable performance. To address these issues, this paper aims to explore the distinct and combined effects of several approaches such as digital business transformation (DBT), organizational ambidexterity (OA) and circular business models (CBMs) on the relationship between I4.0 capabilities and sustainable performance. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing upon a hybrid methodology including structural equation modeling and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, this paper develops and tests a hypothetical model using data collected from 306 organizations in Europe, Asia and Africa. Findings: The study findings lead to several important implications concerning the potential paths linking I4.0 and sustainable performance. Notably, the DBT was found to mediate this relationship by integrating circular principles to devise business models. Moreover, OA was found to substitute the CBMs in developing new sustainable business models and reconcile sustainability. Originality/value: The study is among the first to analyze the combined effects of OA, DBT and CBMs on the relationship between I4.0 capabilities and sustainable performance at the supply chain level. Moreover, the findings propose several solutions to resolve the sustainability dilemma through I4.0 capabilities, DBT, OA and CBMs. Â© 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2021,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109400497&doi=10.1108%2fSCM-04-2021-0152&partnerID=40&md5=42504b6a82cb570bb1c7671b087eb305,Scopus,Article

The integration of these Big Data applications in education generates massive data that put new demands to available processing technologies of data and extraction of useful information. Primarily, several higher educational institutions depend on the knowledge mined from these vast volumes of data to optimise the teaching and learning environment. However, Big Data in the higher education context has relied on traditional data techniques and platforms that are less efficient. This paper, therefore, conducts a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) that examines Big Data framework technologies in higher education outlining gaps that need a solution in Big Educational Data Analytics. We achieved this by summarising the current knowledge on the topic and recommend areas where educational institutions could focus on exploring the potential of Big Data Analytics. To this end, we reviewed 55 related articles out of 1543 selected from Six (6) accessible Computer Science databases between the period of 2007 and 2018, focusing on the development of the Big Data framework and its applicability in education for academic purposes. Our results show that very few researchers have tried to address the integrative use of Big Data framework and learning analytics in higher education. The review further suggests that there is an emerging best practice in applying Big Data Analytics to improve teaching and learning. However, this information does not appear to have been thoroughly examined in higher education. Hence, there is the need for a complete investigation to come up with comprehensive Big Data frameworks that build effective learning systems for instructors, learners, course designers and educational administrators.

Design/methodology/approach The basis for the present research is a cross-sectional design. Data collection from 154 employees occurred using the following structured questionnaires: Customer Knowledge Management (CKM), Innovative Work Behavior (IWB) and Product Innovation Process (PIP). Data processing used SPSS version 26.0, including the PROCESS (3.5) macro analysis. Findings The results show positive relationships between innovative work behavior and the product innovation process (r = 0.420, p < 0.01). Pearson's correlation shows a coefficient of 0.42, meaning that 42% of the variations in perceived product innovation are due to variations in innovative work behavior. The second condition of the mediation test involved testing the relationship between the independent variable (Innovative Work Behavior) and the mediating variable (Knowledge Management) and showed a significant relationship (r = 0.272, p < 0.01). The findings suggested that knowledge management that other determinants supported, such as collaboration in idea exploration, idea championing and encouragement of participation in idea implementation, significantly contributed to the product innovation process (r = 0.509, p < 0.01). The bootstrapping method confirmed that innovative work behavior supports product innovation through the mediation of customer knowledge management (z = 3.01, p = 0.002). Research limitations/implications The cross-sectional design, along with the relatively low number of participants and the self-reporting nature of the questionnaires, represent the current study's main limitations. Developing the research model could integrate new variables, such as customer co-creation processes, performance-based compensation, employee citizenship activities and transformational leadership. Practical implications This research has both theoretical and practical implications. These emphasize the importance of further investigation into the factors influencing companies' innovation processes. They also provide managers with a means of finding a fit between the deployment of customer knowledge mechanisms and the achievement of innovative workplace behavior, to improve innovation process efficiency. Originality/value The current study broadens the empirical research area of customer knowledge management and its impact on both innovative work behavior and the product innovation process, particularly in knowledge-intensive market scenarios that require organizations to be innovative.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/K-09-2021-0818,WOS,Journal

(2019),Organisational learning and export performance of emerging market entrepreneurial firms The roles of RBV mechanism and decision-making approach,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING,,10.1108/EJM-08-2017-0496,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to integrate the resource-based view (RBV) with organisational learning theory by investigating the role of the RBV mechanism in the preceding performance-current performance linkage. The authors further examine the role of the decision-making approach on the RBV-prior-current performance paradigm. Using China as the research setting, they empirically test the theoretical model based on 229 firms selected from a nation-wide survey. Design/methodology/approach This study has used China as the research setting. The authors empirically test the theoretical model based on 229 firms selected from a nation-wide survey. Findings This study reveals that prior export performance is a key determinant of current export performance, and this effect is enhanced by product certification (an internal RBV mechanism) and the intention to make an initial public offering (and external RBV mechanism). Moreover, the internal RBV-prior-current performance paradigm is positively moderated by the delegated decision-making approach, while the external RBV-prior-current performance paradigm is negatively moderated by this decision-making approach. Research limitations/implications - The results related to RBV and prior organisational learning also extends the extant literature and offer implications in two important ways. One, this research advances existing research that has only considered the direct effect of organisational learning on current performance (Lages et al., 2008). In addition to its direct effect, this study suggests that the interplay of organisational learning and resource commitment also provides important determinants of export performance. These new results imply that future research should not only explore the effect of organisational learning theory but also that of firm resource in the research on the prior-current performance dyad (Lages et al., 2008). Two, this study also advances the theoretical development of the export venture resource and management commitment research by revealing two new factors (Cavusgil and Zou, 1994). As a result, when conducting exporting activity from an emerging economy, exporting firms should consider committing their resources on acquiring international certification and seeking external funding. These new findings provide new guidance on the choice of the type of resource commitments and their roles in the prior-current performance conceptualisation when operating in the emerging markets. Practical implications - The results also contribute to the conceptualisation of the decision-making literature in the context of emerging economies (Garnier, 1982; Kao, 1993; Redding, 1993; Solberg, 2000), where an owner decision- making approach is associated with a number of negative effects (Kao, 1993; Redding, 1993). This study suggests that an owner decision-making approach can actually help firms to implement the effect of external RBV's influence in the prior-current performance framework. As a result, the findings imply that researchers and managers of EMEFs should now consider including the effect of decision-making governance when exploring the interactive effect of RBV and organisational learning in export performance research (Lages et al., 2008). Originality/value - This three-way interaction results have implications for the development of organisational learning theory, the RBV, decision-making, export performance and emerging market literature.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EJM-08-2017-0496,WOS,Journal

(2020),Measuring the human capital of scientists in the principal investigator role,JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT,,10.1108/JMD-08-2019-0362,"Purpose There is an emerging literature on scientists in the principal investigator (PI) role that identifies them as central and key actors in entrepreneurial ecosystems. PIs in leading large-scale public research programmes and teams require an array of skills and abilities to be effective in this role. The purpose of this paper is to propose a human capital (HC) measurement scale that can unearth their competencies at the micro level, since there is no specific measurement scale specifically for PIs. Design/methodology/approach The proposed model was reached relying on both qualitative and quantitative methodologies, to then apply exploratory factor analysis (EPT) and confirmatory factor analysis (AFC) to verify its suitability, as well as its internal consistency and reliability using appropriate indices. Findings The proposed model is composed of six PI's HC factors, such as research knowledge, open-mind research ability, research perform ability, stoic research skill, innovation skill and critical skill. Originality/value In proposing this, this paper advances micro-level understanding of the competencies that PIs require to be effective in the role, and answers the call for deeper research on these crucial actors. Shedding light on this issue is beneficial for not only the administrators of the universities, the research centres or the funding agencies to obtain further essential information in selecting the best-qualified person, but also to self-evaluate their skills, abilities and knowledge so that they can direct their efforts towards improving the weak aspects of their HC. Furthermore, it can be an additional useful criterion for defining the career plans of PIs or their promotion policies.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JMD-08-2019-0362,WOS,Journal

However, survival outcomes appear to have plateaued over the last decade. The hope underpinning the current study is to engage data visualization to develop a more holistic understanding of the patient space, supported by principles and techniques borrowed from traditionally disparate disciplines, like cartography and machine learning. Methods and Results: The Minnesota Heart Institute Foundation (MHIF) STEMI database is a large prospective regional STEMI registry consisting of 180 variables of heterogeneous data types on more than 5000 patients spanning 15 years. Initial assessment and preprocessing of the registry database was undertaken, followed by a first proof-of-concept implementation of an analytical workflow that involved machine learning, dimensionality reduction, and data visualization. 38 pre-admission variables were analyzed in an all-encompassing representation of pre-index STEMI event data. We aim to generate a holistic visual representation â€” a map of the multivariate patient space â€” by training a high-resolution self-organizing neural network consisting of several thousand neurons. The resulting 2-D lattice arrangement of n-dimensional neuron vectors allowed patients to be represented as point locations in a 2-D display space. Patient attributes were then visually examined and contextualized in the same display space, from demographics to pre-existing conditions, event-specific procedures, and STEMI outcomes. Data visualizations implemented in this study include a small-multiple display of neural component planes, composite visualization of the multivariate patient space, and overlay visualization of non-training attributes. Conclusion: Our study represents the first known marriage of cartography and machine learning techniques to obtain visualizations of the multivariate space of a regional STEMI registry. Combining cartographic mapping techniques and artificial neural networks permitted the transformation of the STEMI database into novel, two-dimensional visualizations of patient characteristics and outcomes. Notably, these visualizations also drive the discovery of anomalies in the data set, informing corrections applied to detected outliers, thereby further refining the registry for integrity and accuracy. Building on these advances, future efforts will focus on supporting further understanding of risk factors and predictors of outcomes in STEMI patients. More broadly, the thorough visual exploration of display spaces generated through a conjunction of dimensionality reduction with the mature technology base of geographic information systems appears a promising direction for biomedical research.

The research focuses on timber technologies and prefabricated timber components, which are frequently selected in preference to other industrialised building systems because of the advantages they offer in terms of weight, workability and sustainability strategies. A knowledge-based engineering methodology is explored for the design of prefabricated timber-framed external walls, encoding both â€œexplicitâ€ and â€œtacitâ€ knowledge into a digital three-dimensional model. Results demonstrate how such an approach could significantly change common design practices by shifting the major phase of design effort to earlier stages in the project cycle, thereby minimising re-work, reducing data fragmentation and potentially removing the need for drawings. A key finding of this paper is that model interoperability, maintenance and reuse becomes unlikely if an agreed methodology, including a description logic, is not adopted. Despite the need for a rigorous approach, the ability to capture, manage and reuse design knowledge could be of significant benefit to emerging industrialised house building ventures.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper first reviewed the literature on the structure and coordinating mechanism of enterprise innovation ecosystem and identified two important gaps on the characteristics of ecosystem actors and the logic of innovative coordination. Then, the paper adopted grounded analysis about the construction and evolution of Haierâ€™s innovation ecosystem based on longitudinal case data. On the basis of the case study, the construct of firm-level innovation ecosystem and new logic of coordination are formed. Findings: This paper found the emerging phenomenon of sub-organizational ecosystem actors and depicted that the establishing process of firm-level innovation ecosystem went through three majors stages, and the corresponding coordinating logic changed from proactive intervention to reactive self-evolution. Originality/value: This paper tried to make contributions to the studies of structure and coordinating mechanism of enterprise innovation ecosystem, and proposed the enterprise itself could build firm-level ecosystem within its organizational boundary and interact with external ecosystem. The findings enlightened the nested structure of ecosystem, opened the black box of organizational boundary and broke the limitation that existing researches only analyse innovation ecosystem at system level and regard firms as basic analytical unit. Besides, this paper proposed that the coordination of innovation ecosystem can be passively fulfilled by network effect and ecological evolution, where previous studies mainly focused on proactive institutional intervention and resource investment. This point could provide Chinese enterprises with good references.

Online news is unstructured narrative text that embeds facts, frames, and amplification that can influence society attitudes about technology adoption. Online news sources are carriers of voluminous amounts of news for reaching significantly large audience and have no geographical or time boundaries. The interplay of complex and dynamical forces among authors and readers allow for progressive emergent and latent properties to exhibit. Our concept of ""Double subjectivity"" provides a new paradigm for exploring complementary programmable insights of deeply buried meanings in a system. The ability to understand internal embeddedness in a large collection of related articles are beyond the reach of existing computational tools, and are hence left to human readers with unscalable results. This paper uncovers the potential to utilize advanced machine learning in a new way to automate the understanding of implicit structures and their associated latent meanings to give an early human-level insight into emergent technologies, with a concrete example of ""Uber"". This paper establishes the new concept of double subjectivity as an instrument for large-scale machining of unstructured text and introduces a social influence model for the discovery of distinct pathways into emerging technology, and hence an insight.

While sophisticated knowledge management systems do not guarantee effective expertise knowledge transfer to apprentices, their expertise development can be hindered. This study initially examined the relationships between the knowledge collaboration behavior and expertise development of entry-level Structural Engineers within a global engineering and construction company in the refining and petrochemical industries. The main objectives of this pilot study are to (1) develop and test an instrument to measure engineers' extents of knowledge collaboration behavior, expert behavior, work performance, and skills development led by their knowledge collaboration behavior, and (2) explore trends anticipated in the expertise development of entry-level Structural Engineers caused by the evolving knowledge management tools, internal and external collaboration programs of the case study company. Responses from entry-level Structural Engineers and their advisors within the company's Structural Engineering department were collected using a questionnaire. Partial Least Squares (PLS) path modeling was used to analyze the study data. The measurement model was valid and reliable for its initial setting.

(2018),Hulu Video Recommendation: From Relevance to Reasoning,12TH ACM CONFERENCE ON RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS (RECSYS),,10.1145/3240323.3241730,"Online Video Streaming services such as Hulu hosts tens of millions of premium videos, which requires an effective recommendation system to help viewers discover what they enjoy. In this talk, we will introduce Hulu's recent technical progresses in recommender systems and deep-dive into the topic of generating recommendation reason from knowledge graph. We have two user scenarios: the store-shelf and autoplay. The first requires a list of videos to maximize the chance that a viewer would pick one of them to watch. The second requires a sequence of video recommendations such that the viewer would continuously watch within the current session. In the model layer, we designed specific models to match with each user scenario, balancing both exploitation and exploration. For example, we leverage the contextual-bandit model in the store-shelf scenario to adapt the ranking strategy to various types of user feedbacks. To optimize exploitation, we tested several granularity levels for parameter sharing among the arms. For more effective exploration, we incorporate Thomason sampling. For the autoplay scenario, we use a contextual recurrent neural network to predict the next video that the viewer is going to watch. In the feature and data layer, we train embeddings for content, user and contextual info. For example, to train content embeddings, we collect factual tags from metadata, sentiment tags from reviews, and keywords from the captions and object/action recognized using computer vision techniques. Next we will deep-dive into one important topic: generating recommendation reason from knowledge graph. A fact is defined by a tuple of related entities and their relation, which is normally a pair of entities tagged by a relationship. In our problem setting, recommendation results are the targets, viewed as inputs for the reasoning task, consisting of pairs of relevant entities, i. e. a source node and a destination node in a knowledge graph. The recommendation reasoning task is to learn a path or a small directed acyclic subgraph, connecting the source node to the destination node. Since the facts in a knowledge graph have different confidence values for different reasoned targets, we need to conduct a probabilistic inference. The challenge is we do not know a pre-defined set of logic rules to guide the search through the knowledge graph, which prevents us from directly applying the probabilistic logic methods. Inspired by recent advances in deep learning and reinforcement learning, especially in graph neural networks, attention mechanism and deep generative models, we propose two ways to model the reasoning process: the differentiable reasoning approach and the stochastic reasoning approach. Differentiable reasoning approaches are based on graph neural networks [ 1,2] with attention flow and information flow. The attention dynamics is an iterative process of redistributing and aggregating attention over the knowledge graph, starting at the source node. The final attention aggregated at the destination node serves for the prediction to compute the loss. Instead of the prediction accuracy, we care more about how the learned attention dynamics draws its reasoning track in a knowledge graph. Stochastic reasoning approaches frame the reasoning process as learning a probabilistic graphical model consisting of stochastic discrete operations, such as selecting a node and selecting an edge, to build a reason subgraph extracted from the knowledge graph. The model is known as stochastic computation graphs (SCGs), and to learn it, we propose a generalized backpropagation framework Backprop-Q [ 3] to overcome the gradient-blocking issues in applying standard back-propagation. In summary, we give an overview of the recommendation research in Hulu and deep-dive into our differentiable reasoning approach and stochastic reasoning approach for generating recommendation reasons based on a knowledge graph.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3240323.3241730,WOS,Conference Paper

Intelligent Decision Support Systems (IDSS) introduce effective and efficient paths from raw data to decision by involving visualization and data mining technologies. Data mining-based DSS produces potentially interesting patterns from data. The transition from extracted patterns to knowledge is a delicate task. In this context, we propose to adapt a common visual analytics process for creating a path that enables the user (decision-maker) to automatically explore and visually extract insights by interacting with the patterns. This proposal is inspired from integrating traditional visual analytics concepts with the mental model of knowledge visualization. The idea is to combine an automatic and visual analysis of patterns to generate knowledge for the purpose of decision-making.

The study of smart cities from the perspective of humanism provides an effec-tive theoretical tool for geographiers in this field. Different from the perspective of technocentrism that regards smart cities as a collection of physical spaces composed of a communication infrastructure network and digital technology, the humanism perspective emphasizes the interaction of technology, humanistic governance (soci-ety), and space in a specific (local) context. It calls for a micro-survey of the local cooperation mechanism of information and communication technology (ICT) innovation and smart city construction, as well as governance decision making carried out by multiple actors, with a view to revealing the construction process and localized driving mechanism of smart cities, and with an emphasis on the data analysis of individual actions to find out a development path consistent with local conditions. This study examined the latest developments in humanistic research on smart cities, arguing that current studies still follow the technocentric perspective or adopt the oppo-site knowledge-centric position, but lack a technology-society synergy perspective. On this basis, this article pro-poses future research topics that are worthy of in-depth discussion, namely, the symbiosis of technology and soci-ety, the complexity of social interactions on technology innovation, and the contextual analysis of technology innovation and interactions. Our discussion may help to understand how smart cities, as a complex human-environ-ment system, undergo transformation in the continuous interaction of people and technology, and provide some theoretical references for the study of smart cities in China.

Within such development, this study explored the future vision and anticipated scenarios of data infrastructure and digital libraries for smart community development. It draws upon the mixed-methods approach combining ethnographic participant observation, document analysis and semi-structured interviews. Grounded in socio-technical framework and rooted in empirical methods, this research produces results that augment design thinking and visioning practice for digital data libraries beyond traditional boundaries. The findings reveal the emerging scenarios around complex adaptive systems, intelligent data infrastructure and future digital libraries all in the context of building infrastructure for human-centred communities. Situated in this advancing reality, the results further discuss the next-generation data and information user experience, smart infrastructure data environment and future library capabilities. The article concludes that a smart library system, whether in its conceptual form of a â€˜digital octopusâ€™ or a â€˜smart village data hubâ€™ or an â€˜intelligent virtual assistantâ€™, will provide intelligence in data gathering, processing, summarising, communication and recommendations. By delivering unified and personalised data solutions, it will offer an end-to-end seamless experience for users throughout their journey of knowledge pursuit.

The dismantling of fossil fuel vehicle phase-out policy in Taiwan,ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE,,10.1016/j.erss.2022.102571,"Phasing out fossil fuel vehicles is an indispensable pillar to decarbonize the transportation sector. In 2017, Taiwan proposed to ban all new sales of gasoline-powered scooters by 2035 and passenger cars by 2040. In less than two years, the phase-out policy was suspended. We explore this policy failure through the lens of multi-level perspective (MLP) framework and examine the interactions between the radical niche innovations, the incum-bent regime, and the socio-technical landscape. We first show that the scooter industry played a decisive role in the policymaking processes. As an emerging niche innovation, however, the e-scooter manufacturers faced difficulties with scaling up their new system and confronting customer complaints. We also illustrate that Tai-wan's fossil fuel vehicle phase-out suffers from hasty policy formulation and lack of effective coordination. The incumbent regime took advantage of the fragmented governance structure, and even brought back gasoline scooter subsidies successfully. In the socio-technical landscape, the phase-out policy is embedded in the ruling party's progressive reform package. Taiwan's gasoline scooter supply chains, in the campaign of Equal Rights for Gasoline and Electricity, appropriated the rhetoric of social justice and framed the phase-out policy as unfair. Facing huge defeat in the local election in 2018, the ruling party considered the phase-out policy as immature and reversed course.

Design/methodology/approach: This study is a cross-sectional study. Data were obtained from three public hospital pharmacies and three private hospital pharmacies in Kuwait. Partial least square structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. Findings: A total of 272 surveys (59.1 percent response rate) were completed and returned. The results indicated a significant positive relationship between organizational learning and patient safety culture in hospital pharmacy settings (path coefficient of 0.826, p-value &lt;0.05 and R2 of 0.683). Several dimensions of the organizational learning showed significant links to the various dimensions of the pharmacy patient safety culture. Specifically, training (TRN), management that reinforces learning (MRL) and supportive learning environment (SLE) had the strongest effects on the pharmacy patient safety culture dimensions. Moreover, these effects indicated that MRL, SLE and TRN were associated with improvements in most dimensions of pharmacy patient safety culture.

It implies in the creation or recognition of new forms of differentiation, the Opportunities Identification (OI). These may be due, among others, to new solutions or new problems to be solved, the latter a less explored path in the Product Development Process. There are studies aimed at systematizing OI, but present a discreet behavior in front of intuitive approaches. These rely on individual talent, a non-unanimous resource. As innovation is time-sensitive, there is room for artificial stimuli to intuition, which relies on the need for a close understanding of the phenomenon. This paper presents the descriptive research outcomes from a broader prescriptive study, which adopted the Design Research Methodology structure. Because OI is primarily a cognitive process and difficult to observe by a third party, one of the researchers submitted himself to the experience and recording of the phenomenon. The experience constitutes a unique case of OI accompanied during 2590 days. During this time, the study recorded 137 potential opportunities (units of analysis) by serendipity. Through the interpretation of the experienced phenomenon, the results comprise three perspectives: i/to the interaction of influence factors pointed out in the literature; ii/to the opportunities emergence; and, iii/to the opportunities identification. It is evident the challenge of considering opportunities as problems by its tendency of incubation. The work presents new research questions, hypotheses, and explanations valid to the case that potentially stimulate new exploratory or confirmatory researches or both.

The whole development was triggered directly by these two goals, broken down into actions and objectives seen from the users perspective and seeking compliance with ergonomic recommendations and guidelines for multimedia. The software makes use of a set of innovative interface tools, both in what concerns user tools for orientation, access and assimilation of the knowledge base and in terms of the structure of the software contents as well as its graphic design. A requirement analysis was carried out, that led to the design of the conceptual structure of the software application, alongside user interaction sketches, and the identification of illustration and animation spots. The concept of user level was instrumental to focus user motivation for learning and progression in the application's knowledge base, and also led to the creation of quizzes within each content category. Development started with literature review and acquaintance with the applicable legislation and regulations, aiming at meeting the needs of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) with an industrial character, in terms of continual improvement of their practices in the realm of Health and Safety at Work (HSW). Systematization of hazard and risk categories was pursued. The interface is structured in nodes of information, interconnected, and endowed with graphical elements that have interactive features. The structure of the software supports a hypertext organization of the information, with a view to enable the user to design her, or his, own path on the way to attain a deepened and enlarged understanding of concepts and greater conscience leading to increased knowledge about the subject matter. The user is given several settings options, enabling the program to assume a configuration that is intended as more suitable to the user. This process also entails a quiz that is the basis for attributing a user level. The possibility of bypassing this quiz is also foreseen, with immediate transfer to what is considered the second part of the software interface. This area, can be explored starting from the main console, by selecting one of the four hazard categories. A detailed depiction is found in each of them, illustrated and with games, meant to test knowledge acquired, in a playful way. Once each of the categories is explored, users gain access to the third phase of the program, which is evident from the change in the central console. Here a structured evaluation of the company is carried out by the user. The program then offers recommendations, warnings and preventive measures that aim at mitigating the problems detected in the guided diagnosis and promote the improvement of HSW. The software makes use of a set of user interface tools, including a dynamic map and the possibility of user annotations appended to the contents as well as drop-down menu based navigation, derived from ergonomic guidelines for multimedia.

With microgrids gaining space as a competing and parallel distribution grid model and challenging the current centralized grid system, studying their adoption presents an opportunity to understand this socio-technical transition in the energy system. This study looks at this ongoing change in the United States and applies the Multi-Level Perspective framework to explore the drivers, contexts, processes, policies, institutions, and interactions that affect the adoption of microgrids. Through a qualitative case study analysis of California, New York, and Oregon, the study finds that natural disasters, massive power outages and climate change concerns have acted as key pressures for the adoption of microgrids. At the same time, the electric power system maintains important stabilization mechanisms, such as the availability of cheap and abundant electricity, as well a market structure that limits the opportunities of entry and profit for third-party developers, which make it harder for niche innovations like microgrids to break in.

The strategic significance of knowledge for construction contractors, as knowledge-intensive firms, cannot be overemphasized. However, there is a limited number of studies that explore the IC-firm performance (FP) linkage with a focus on construction firms. This study explores the link between IC and FP in construction contracting firms. It also proposes exploratory and exploitative innovation as the mechanisms through which IC evolves to affect FP. The hypotheses linking IC, innovation, and FP are tested with survey data from 135 managers in construction contracting firms in Hong Kong. The results of partial least squares structural equation modeling show that human capital, social capital, and relational capital directly influence FP, but organizational capital does not. Exploratory innovation shows a mix of full and partial mediating effects in the relationships between IC dimensions (except human capital) and FP. In contrast, exploitative innovation plays no mediating role in linking IC with FP. This study has advanced discussions on the effects of IC on FP by examining exploratory and exploitative innovation as the black box elements through which IC is translated into FP. It also makes a novel contextual contribution to the IC-FP literature by exploring their interrelationships in the context of construction contracting firms.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000864,WOS,Journal

Design/methodology/approach: This study engages in an extensive scale development effort to collect representative data about the NBS in the Pakistani setting, complemented by relevant validity and reliability tests. The overall theoretical model was tested on 214 firms by means of a structural equation modeling approach, using partial least-squares algorithms. Findings: The results statistically supported the role of firm-level knowledge repositories (intellectual capital) and knowledge exploration and exploitation capabilities (absorptive capacity) as sequential mediators in the association of NBS and firm-level innovation. Besides, bridging networks of lateral ties among Pakistani businesses are found to be more effective than bonding networks of vertical ties in encouraging radical innovations. Originality/value: This study significantly extends the literature about the NBS approach. It provides specific sense-making mechanisms (i.e. priming, triggering and editing) about how abstract institutional templates constituted at the business system level are translated into firm-level actionable sets by the help of intangible resource repositories and processes that guide knowledge exploration and exploitation.

Presenting multiple examples and evidence of the potential genetic flexibility of microbial systems to counteract the climate induced stresses associated with their host as a part of indigenous system, this book presents strategies and approaches for improvement of microbiome. As climate changes have altered the global carbon cycling and ecological dynamics, the regular and periodic occurrences of severe salinity, drought, and heat stresses across the different regimes of the agro-ecological zones have put additional constraints on agricultural ecosystem to produce efficient foods and other derived products for rapidly growing world population through low cost and sustainable technology. Furthermore chemical amendments, agricultural inputs and other innovative technologies although may have fast results with fruitful effects for enhancing crop productivity but also have other ecological drawbacks and environmental issues and offer limited use opportunities. Microbial formulations and/or microbial consortia deploying two or multiple partners have been frequently used for mitigation of various stresses, however, field success is often variable and improvement Smart, knowledge-driven selection of microorganisms is needed as well as the use of suitable delivery approaches and formulations. Microbial Management of Plant Stresses: Current Trends, Application and Challenges presents the functional potential of plant microbiota to address current challenges in crop production addressing this urgent need to bring microbial innovations into practice. Key Features Demonstrates microbial ecosystems as an indigenous system for improving plant growth, health and stress resilience Covers all the novel aspects of microbial regulatory mechanism.

Italy is the second largest producer of olive oil; this cultivation represents the nation's most important supply chain, especially in the southern Italian Calabrian region, contributing to both local and rural economies. However, in a Calabrian context, olive production underperforms due to structural and managerial weaknesses, and farming techniques' potential impacts are not properly addressed due to farmers' poor knowledge of agricultural sustainability techniques. Therefore, Calabrian olive growing requires innovation, especially to respond to new sustainability requirements, currently claimed by public policies (eco-conditionality), and consumers and citizens increasingly concerned with environmental quality, human health and social liveability. This paper analyses the aspects that require innovation towards sustainability aims by exploring the perceptions of various actors, including local and supply chain stakeholders, and highlighting and suggesting new pathways to be introduced in Calabrian olive growing. The application of a mixed qualitative/quantitative statistical method, or the â€˜Q-methodologyâ€™, small and medium-sized farms, academic experts, technicians and consumers have been interviewed to investigate their perceptions and interpretations of sustainability issues. Further, their opinions on possible weaknesses and areas of improvement are examined, highlighting either a consensus or diversity regarding their points of view. The results indicated that all actors perceived a need to orient Calabrian olive growing towards more sustainable management practices by better exploiting its potential and focusing on product quality. Sustainable innovation, in this sense, would increase production efficiency and economic performance, thus satisfying the need for employment and fairer remunerations.

Bringing a new technology to the market involves accounting for infrastructures, network and competences of a firm across a timeframe spanning from short to long term. A growing part of the scientific community addresses this heterogeneous task through the definition of the Business Model (BM). BM is emerging as a separate field of study including all the aspects related with technological application: their definition, use, interconnection and evolution. Nevertheless, BM is a relatively poorly explored area of contribution in the manufacturing domain. This paper delves into specific literature to provide a more extensive characterization of the aspects discussed within manufacturing research through the lens of the BM perspective. Specifically, it contributes to describe the impact of trends such as Servitization and Sustainability which affect the BM's components and could possibly trigger a Business Model Innovation in manufacturing firms.

The impact of social media on diffusion of sustainable mobility opinions is not well-understood given the present lack of data. To address this gap, this paper introduces a modeling framework for the impact of social media on opinion diffusion. Inspired by Roger's diffusion theory, the framework applies different learning mechanisms (e.g., word-of-mouth and mass media) in network architectures to explore the effects of network topology on acceptance of green travel alternatives using conceptual idealizations of the complex processes involved in diffusion interactions. We present a dynamic agent-based simulation methodology capturing the impact of information and communications technology (ICT) like social media on diffusion of environmentally friendly travel mode consideration through social networks. The agent-based models provide visual comparisons of the effects of network structure and social media influence on opinion diffusion, the way opinions spread, and which agents exhibit the strongest influence. We identify types of social media influencers that most effectively encourage adoption of sustainable transportation alternatives and present an illustrative framework of the mechanisms that drive opinion diffusion. Exploratory findings suggest that (1) scale-free networks provide the slowest initial diffusion rate but the greatest overall diffusion over time, (2) the most effective behavior incentivization strategies depend on network structure, (3) in scale-free networks, increasing the number of initial opinion leaders improves diffusion, while increasing the number of communication encounters within the network over the first year following product deployment does not noticeably improve diffusion, and (4) providing smaller financial incentives to a greater number of opinion leaders is the best strategy.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tbs.2020.01.003,WOS,Journal

The mechanisms for PC technology adoption have yet to be defined, which inhibits its diffusion in the construction market. This study aims to reveal the intrinsic motivation and action mechanism for PC technology adoption. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on the technology acceptance model (TAM), the study integrates characteristics from the diffusion of innovation theory to propose a multifaceted model for explaining practitionersâ€™ PC technology adoption behavior from technology, organization and environment contexts. The proposed theoretical model was empirically examined via a survey of 234 professionals in mainland China using the partial least squares-structural equation modeling technique. Findings: The outcomes indicated that relative advantage, corporate social responsibility and market demand are significantly positively related to practitionersâ€™ perceived usefulness from PC technology. Regulatory support and trading partner support have noticeable positive effects on practitionersâ€™ perceived ease of use from PC technology. Perceived ease of use is found to positively influence perceived usefulness, and both of them have a positive influence on the attitude toward adopting PC technology. Attitude is further confirmed as an important predictor of adoption intention, which would lead to actual PC technology adoption behavior. Originality/value: To the best of the authorsâ€™ knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to explore industry perceptions toward PC technology adoption, providing valuable guidance for the effective diffusion of PC technology and laying a reliable foundation for research on other construction innovation adoption in post-COVID-19.

Key features of the traditional blockbuster model are revealed in the context of the main trends in pharma business environment that might have an adverse impact on this model effectiveness, in particular skyrocketing R&D costs, massive patent cliffs and tightening regulatory pressure on drug prices. The author analyzes various adaptive strategies used by Big Pharma firms, including mega mergers and acquisitions, intensive globalization and expansion into emerging markets, and makes the conclusion that these strategic moves had a limited effect in bringing about lasting change. The key solution to industry challenges had been found on the way of reconsidering the dominant players' business model. The author relates the emergence of the new specialty pharma model to the serious changes in the basic architecture of customer value creation, delivery and capture mechanisms. The rapid growth of specialty care drugs in the portfolios of Big Pharma companies led to dramatic shifts not only in the target customer audience but also in the fundamental approach that these firms had to take regarding customer interaction, promotion and distribution systems, as well as the way of making profit. Even more significant changes could be observed in R&D sphere where Big Pharma companies have been intensively developing symbiotic relationships with innovative biotechnological firms. Given their effective and flexible R&D mechanism, the dynamic biotech firms have already become the most attractive participants of Big Pharma emerging innovation ecosystems. The author concludes that most of today's Big Pharma companies represent a hybrid business model meaning parallel development of the traditional blockbuster and the new specialty pharma models. This combination allows pharmaceutical giants to retain effective control over the rapidly changing global industry marketplace.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.20542/0131-2227-2022-66-3-81-89,WOS,Journal

Design/methodology/approach: The empirical basis is data derived from four workshops, five interviews with staff from advisory organizations, and interviews with 11 farmers. Findings: Emerging configurations serve different types of farmers, that is, private advisors serve different clients in different ways; these could be considered subsystems within the overall advisory system. Practical implications: Best-fit configurations of advisory services exist within a country setting in response to farmers' information demands and how they seek information, as well as public goals of the advisory system, and lead to advisory subsystems. Policymakers should monitor the emergence of these subsystems and become active participants in some of them, in line with the concept of the public sector as regulator of private and commercial advisory systems. Theoretical implications: Best-fit has been mainly explored at country level, but this study shows that, within countries, different advisory service configurations are formed. So, best-fit should not be considered at national level only, in view of subsystems which can have wider or narrower boundaries. More broadly, the concept of Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation Systems (AKIS) should not be confined to the national level, for example, in view of farmer specializations within countries and the international dimensions of advisory systems.

An atomic-energy based deep-learning neural network (NN) is used to represent the PES function, and the weighted atom-centered symmetry functions are employed as inputs of the NN model to satisfy the translational, rotational, and permutational symmetries, and to capture the geometry features of each atom and its individual chemical environment. Several standard technical tricks are used in the construction of NN-PES, which includes the application of clustering algorithm in the formation of the training dataset, the examination of the reliability of the NN-PES model by different fitted NN models, and the detection of the out-of-confidence region by the confidence interval of the training dataset. The accuracy of the full-dimensional NN-PES model is examined by two benchmark calculations with respect to ab initio data. Both the NN and electronic-structure calculations give a similar H-atom dissociation reaction pathway on the T1 state in the intrinsic reaction coordinate analysis. The small-scaled trial dynamics simulations based on NN-PES and ab initio PES give highly consistent results. After confirming the accuracy of the NN-PES, a large number of trajectories are calculated in the quasi-classical dynamics, which allows us to get a better understanding of the T1-driven H-atom dissociation dynamics efficiently. Particularly, the dynamics simulations from different initial conditions can be easily simulated with a rather low computational cost. The influence of the mode-specific vibrational excitations on the H-atom dissociation dynamics driven by the T1 state is explored. The results show that the vibrational excitations on symmetric C-H stretching, asymmetric C-H stretching, and C=O stretching motions always enhance the H-atom dissociation probability obviously.

Despite its necessity and potential to improve care in measurable ways, there are several issues related to patient safety, high costs, high failure rates and limited adoption by end-users. This mixed-method study aims to explore the role of simulation as a potential testbed for diminishing the risks, pitfalls and resources associated with development and implementation of medical innovations. Methods Subject-matter experts consisting of physicians, engineers, scientists and industry leaders participated in four semistructured teleconferences each lasting up to 2 hours each. Verbal data were transcribed verbatim, coded and categorised according to themes using grounded theory, and subsequently synthesised into a conceptual framework. Panelists were then invited to complete an online survey, ranking the (1) current use and (2) potential effectiveness of simulation-based technologies and techniques for evaluating and facilitating the product life cycle pathway. This was performed for each theme of the previously generated conceptual framework using a Likert scale of 1 (no effectiveness) to 9 (highest possible effectiveness) and then segregated according to various forms of simulation. Results Over 100 hours of data were collected and analysed. After 7 rounds of inductive data analysis, a conceptual framework of the product life cycle was developed. This framework helped to define and characterise the product development pathway. Agreement between reviewers for inclusion of items after the final round of analysis was 100%. A total of 7 themes were synthesised and categorised into 3 phases of the pathway: 'design and development', 'implementation and value creation' and 'product launch'. Strong discrepancies were identified between the current and potential roles of simulation in each phase. Simulation was felt to have the strongest potential role for early prototyping, testing for safety and product quality and testing for product effectiveness and ergonomics. Conclusions Simulation has great potential to fulfil several unmet needs in healthcare innovation. This framework can be used to help guide innovators and channel resources appropriately. The ultimate goal is a structured, well-defined process that will result in a product development outcome that has the greatest potential to succeed. Â© Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper adopts a qualitative, longitudinal participantobservation research design. A single case study firm was observed over a ten-year period of active researcher engagement allowing for the collection of rich data on the development and deployment of dynamic capabilities as they evolved. Findings - Dynamic capabilities can be identified as sensing, seizing and transforming. They are capable of intentional development by managers through strategic decision making and deliberative learning, within a path-dependent evolution. Research limitations/implications - A longitudinal single case study allowed for a close look at the development of dynamic capabilities, exploring the context and conditions that facilitated change and tracing the evolution of the organization's processes. However, this study remains subject to the limits of a single case approach. Future cross-sectional research would be able to test the conceptual model and allow for generalization of the findings to other populations of firms. Practical implications - The dynamic capability concept has been criticized for being of little practical use to managers. This research shows the process of intentional dynamic capability development, offering insights to practicing managers. Originality/value - This research adds to the relatively scant base of empirical work on dynamic capabilities and offers a conceptual model of dynamic capability development.

In the current big data and artificial intelligence network environment, new teaching concepts, characteristics, and model applications should be analyzed, and an education model based on artificial intelligence adaptive control and negative feedback adjustment mechanisms under the big data environment should be explored. The study of this model can provide practical experience and reference value for the application, popularization, and innovation of teaching information technology in the future. Combining the characteristics of big data games, this paper proposes a college student education model based on discrete dynamic model big data game. The scores of college students represent comprehensive information such as their qualifications to provide big data university education, the credit of historical records, and the degree of reliable data transmission. Based on the general model of the adaptive learning system, we have perfected the functions of each module in the overall structure of the domain-based special subject system and designed the overall workflow of the system. Computerized evaluation is introduced into the learner module, and an adaptive evaluation system structure based on cognitive diagnosis theory is designed to achieve a personalized topic selection model for different learners and enrich learners' experience through more detailed and specialized evaluation results. The model lays the foundation for adaptive course path recommendation. This paper proposes a discrete real-time linear dynamic logic that can express discrete real-time characteristics and all regular characteristics. It can easily describe the behavior of some complex real-time systems. Experiments show that the discrete dynamic model big data game efficiency is improved by 35.71%, which can better optimize the education model of college students. In addition, it can be concluded that the research on the effectiveness of college student education in the era of big data not only determines the safety of the ideological field of colleges and universities but also affects the thinking orientation of college students.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/6185837,WOS,Journal

A deep understanding of QC requires the integration of knowledge across numerous technical fields, such as physics, computing and mathematics. This work aims to investigate how immersive Virtual Reality (VR) compares to a desktop environment (Ä web-applet') as an educational tool to help teach individuals QC fundamentals. We developed two interactive learning tutorials, one utilising the Ä Bloch sphere' visualisation to represent a single-qubit system, and the other exploring multi-qubit systems through the lens of Ä quantum entanglement'. We evaluate the effectiveness of each medium to teach QC fundamentals in a user study with 24 participants. We find that the Bloch sphere visualisation was well-suited to VR over a desktop environment. Our results also indicate that mathematics literacy is an important factor in facilitating greater learning with this effect being notably more pronounced when using VR. However, VR did not significantly improve learning in a multi-qubit context. Our work provides valuable insights which contribute to the emerging field of Quantum HCI (QHCI) and VR for education.

Telephone numbers, E-Mail inboxes, or Internet Protocol (IP)-addresses are irrelevant to define us as human beings at first glance. However, with the omnipresence of digital space the digital aspects of identity gain importance. In this submission, we aim to put recent developments in context and provide a categorization to frame the landscape as developments proceed rapidly. First, we present selected philosophical perspectives on identity. Secondly, we explore how the legal landscape is approaching identity from a traditional dogmatic perspective both in national and international law. After blending the insights from those sections together in a third step, we will go on to describe and discuss current developments that are driven by the emergence of new tools such as Distributed Ledger Technology and Zero Knowledge Proof. One of our main findings is that the management of digital identity is transforming from a purpose driven necessity toward a self-standing activity that becomes a resource for many digital applications. In other words, whereas traditionally identity is addressed in a predominantly sectoral fashion whenever necessary, new technologies transform digital identity management into a basic infrastructural service, sometimes even a commodity. This coincides with a trend to take the control over identity away from governmental institutions and corporate actors to self-sovereign individuals, who have now the opportunity to manage their digital self autonomously. To make our conceptual statements more relevant, we present several already existing use cases in the public and private sector. Subsequently, we discuss potential risks that should be mitigated in order to create a desirable relationship between the individual, public institutions, and the private sector in a world where self-sovereign identity management has become the norm. We will illustrate these issues along the discussion around privacy, as well as the development of backup mechanisms for digital identities. Despite the undeniable potential for the management of identity, we suggest that particularly at this point in time there is a clear need to make detailed (non-technological) governance decisions impacting the general design and implementation of self-sovereign identity systems.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fbloc.2020.00026,WOS,Journal

The study conducted a quasi-experimental factorial 2 (advertisement message framing: health vs. environmental benefits) Ã— 2 (expert endorse-ment: present vs. absent) between-subject design involving 300 adult participants from Pakistan. Using a multi-group structural equation model, the four conditions were assigned to each participant group (n = 75) to test the hypothesized relationships. The quasi-experiment results suggested that the advertisement messages (ad-framed) incorporated with the health and environmental benefits, as delineated by experts, can be a viable communication strategy in developing effortless cognitive cues towards GMF acceptance. The pioneer findings validate the significant efficacy of advertisement messages (ad-framed with expert opinions) in reducing perceived risk through augmented objective knowledge that activates the mechanism of favorable development of attitude and acceptance of GMF. The study findings offer strategic directions to policymakers, marketers, and food technologists in raising greater awareness and acceptance towards GMF products. Â© 2021 by the authors.

Design/methodology/approach Animation production is tactile, multimodal and multisensory which allows for wide application alongside traditional learning tools, targeting multiple learning pathways with its visual, auditory and kinaesthetic approach. Individuals with FASD require information to be explained in a concrete way to enable them to process and understand. Most information can be drawn, providing a visual to assist the individual, but we must also consider abstract concepts which require further explanation or a series of drawings to display the concepts development. Animation, however, allows us the opportunity to make abstract concepts concrete, contextualising the concept in a visualisation of the child's story, narrated with their voice and designed to represent their world, in a film produced entirely by them, therefore allowing opportunity for a therapeutic approach to learning through storytelling. This learning tool is designed to be implemented in a specifically designed therapeutic learning environment to enhance the benefits of participation from both educational and therapeutic perspectives. Findings A review of relevant literature highlights a significant connection between animation, the learning needs of those with FASD and the need for a therapeutic learning environment. This is a proof of concept study, demonstrating the value and potential of animation film making in this new area of practical application. The study closely considers the learning environment from a therapeutic perspective and aims not only to develop a learning tool but to also define the optimum therapeutic learning environment. The study is therefore untested at this stage. Practical implications - Phase 2 of this ongoing research study seeks to explore additional benefits of participation and engagement with the process in an educational and therapeutic context. Considerations of the therapeutic learning environment will be further explored to determine the optimum setting to support the ongoing learning of this pedagogically bereft ( Carpenter, 2011) population. Phase 2 also aims to clarify therapeutic benefits as additional outcomes of participation in this programme. Originality/value - The proposed learning tool and therapeutic learning environment outlined in this paper is an original contribution to knowledge and if found to be successful, could offer significant opportunities for a therapeutic approach to education for this population and others.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/ADD-11-2018-0021,WOS,Journal

Our study motivations stem from two facets of the emerging markets: first, the institutional barriers and, second, the resource constraints. We argue that there is a synergy in the concepts of frugal innovation and sustainability in supply chains and there is a need to further explore this synergy. Furthermore, we claim that even in the wake of many success stories in the frugal innovative supply chain management practices from emerging markets such as India, there are very few, if any, attempts made to understand the implications of a sustainability oriented frugal innovations in the particular context. To address this gap, we develop a model to establish the linkage between sustainable supply chains and frugal innovations. Our proposed conceptual framework depicts the hierarchy and interlinks of the identified enablers in developing sustainability oriented frugal innovative capabilities in supply chains. Furthermore, we have empirically validated our theoretical framework using survey data. We observed that most of the interpretive links are supported. These findings extend the understanding of frugal innovation for supply chain sustainability using multi-method research design, while also providing theoretically guidance to managers in the development of frugal innovation capability to achieve sustainability in supply chain in resource constrained environment.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09537287.2018.1493139,WOS,Journal

In this changing and newly emerging business and marketing ecosystem, the challenge of marketing teaching pedagogy is increasing day by day. In marketing management teaching pedagogical research, there is a scarcity of integrated blended framework consisting of teaching technology and augmented learning exposure in supporting classroom teaching methodology. The study attempts to identify how various factors like theoretical knowledge, practical orientation, teaching technology and augmented learning can impact marketing management educationâ€™s learning outcome in the Indian context. Current research has also tried developing and examining a structured framework that may strengthen the classroom teaching environment. This article is based on empirical data of 693 marketing and sales professionals who are mostly alumni from topmost Indian B-schools. Exploratory factor analyses and structural equation modelling, and path analysis are being done to test the conceptual research model.

Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative research strategy incorporating an open-ended questionnaire was used to collect data from 15 senior B2B marketing managers in three Korean companies that deployed the customer-centred approach. The grounded theory technique (Strauss and Corbin, 1998) and the mind map method (Burgess-Allen and Owen-Smith, 2010) were used to show how senior Korean marketing managers' thoughts are processed and knowledge transfer occurs. Findings - The findings show that a governance mechanism is instrumental in guiding interactive communication that results in knowledge being used that benefits the members of a partnership arrangement. The knowledge development process is enhanced by mutual trust and emotional bonds that are established through socialization. Cyclical interaction through socialization and frequent (in)formal meetings facilitates the process of turning explicit knowledge into tacit knowledge and vice versa, and encourages new knowledge to be developed. Socialization also helps to reduce learning myopia and contributes to the innovatory processes that result in customer needs being met.

There are signs of highly dynamic changes in the learning and working environment of the 21st century, with serious global social consequences similar to the industrial revolution. In the working environment, computers assist people and reduce their workload in a variety of ways. With increasing computing power and advanced memory technologies, they master the basics of autonomous machine learning. Intelligent algorithms are increasingly taking control, with the result that in many occupations, decisions are already routinely taken by software systems and not by people any more. Within just a few decades, information technology and its associated technological requirements have become the catalyst for a highly industrialised society. Developments in microelectronics are progressing at exponential speed, which will also have far-reaching social consequences for vocational fields outside of the information and communication technologies. Impacts of the knowledge and information society include changes in the nature of work towards an increasingly important service sector and a significant increase in knowledge work. This is accompanied by a decline in the working population (demographic change) and the need for a modified workplace design in context of the changed age structure of the workforce. This Paper intends to explore on basis of the findings from the most recent German Foresight Exercise (BMBF Foresight Cycle II), how technological innovations in the field of ICT will dramatically change structures and ways of communication, collaboration and work. Some alternative development paths and implications for the areas job, career, production and work are scrutinized and discussed.

Drawing on knowledge-based view, this paper first proposes a model to integrate IT design with relationships governance, then investigates and compares the technological and relational antecedents of collaborative innovation for focal firms in IT-enabled IORs, and finally explores the competitive performance impact of collaborative innovation. The research model is evaluated with data collected from 191 Chinese firms that digitally collaborate with their distributors. The findings suggest that digital platforms capability and two governance mechanisms (i.e., contractual governance and relational governance) work together to influence collaborative innovation, which in turn enables focal firms to obtain competitive performance. This study provides theoretical and practical implications for collaborative innovation literature by discovering the different impacts of IT design and governance mechanisms on collaborative innovation in the context of IT-enabled IORs.

(2016),Participatory scenario planning for developing innovation in community adaptation responses: three contrasting examples from Latin America,REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE,,10.1007/s10113-015-0898-7,"Environmental change requires adaptive responses that are innovative, forward-looking and anticipatory, in order to meet goals for sustainability in socio-ecological systems. This implies transformative shifts in understanding as conceptualised by the idea of 'double'- or 'triple-loop learning'. Achieving this can be difficult as communities often rely on shorter-term coping mechanisms that purport to maintain the status quo. The use of participatory scenario planning to stimulate forward-looking social learning for adaptation was investigated through three contrasting community case studies on natural resource management in Latin America (in Mexico, Argentina and Colombia). Exploratory scenario narratives that synthesised local knowledge and future perceptions were used iteratively to define response options considered robust across multiple futures. Despite its intensive format, participants in each case agreed that scenario planning enabled a more systematic appraisal of the future. Scenarios facilitated innovation by providing scope to propose new types of responses and associated actions. Differences in local context meant that learning about future change developed in diverse ways, showing a need for a reflexive process. Reframing of key issues characteristic of double-loop learning did occur, albeit through different forms of interaction in each location. However, a shift towards transformative actions characteristic of triple-loop learning was less evident. Achieving this would appear to require ongoing use of scenarios to challenge social norms in light of changing drivers. Use of learning loops as a diagnostic to evaluate adaptive responses provided a useful reference framework although in practice both innovation and consolidative approaches can develop concurrently for responses to different issues.",2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-015-0898-7,WOS,Journal

A systematic literature review was conducted, focusing on the mapping of the specificities of publications on frugal innovation. Our results show an emerging theme that has grown substantially over the last three years. Frugal innovation has generated significant changes for people, especially in the aspect of products and services offered to society. The societal benefit of frugal innovations in socially vulnerable communities still has potential for exploration in forthcoming studies, particularly with regard to tangible indicators of impact measurement. Despite the gradual evolution of publications on the theme over the years, the focus of the studies is still centered on conceptual investigations and descriptive case studies. Some propositional and evaluative approaches appear in the studies, but there is still a need to use management theories to instill an awareness of management precepts that recognize the social dynamics of the operationalization of frugal innovation. Future studies can generate breakthroughs with analytical categories that explore the perspectives of a resource-based view: institutional theory, contingency theory, learning theory, and actor network theory.

If remanufacturing is to occupy a central role in the CE it needs to be considered from a series of complementary and synchronous business activities. Thus, the aim of this article is to investigate how such an integrated perspective can drive sustainable value creation within the context of remanufacturing business models. This is explored through three business cases: Philips Healthcare Refurbished Systems, Siemens Wind Power, and Orangebox. This â€˜integrated viewâ€™ considers remanufacturing activities according to: product design and development; remanufacturing processes; value chain design and management; and marketing and consumer/user relationship. The research question asks, â€˜Can an integrated perspective drive sustainable value creation in remanufacturing contexts?â€™ To answer this, the research maps a set of triple-bottom-line indicators across the chosen cases. The work contributes to the field by mapping a set of business mechanisms (e.g. warranties, service approaches, partnerships) that can be utilised to co-develop necessary activities in unison for a successful remanufacturing approach. In certain cases, remanufacturing has the potential to add to the triple-bottom-line through such an integrated approach. However, each of the firms are investing in remanufacturing predominantly for profitability and market protection measures and therefore environmental and social components of the triple-bottom-line must be proactively considered.

However, how RI would be practised in different cultural contexts and settings is still less studied, especially in the context of developing countries. Taking the utilisation of CO2 in Indonesia as an empirical case, the purpose of this paper is to explore this issue through examining the influence of key characteristics of Indonesia's national culture on core dimensions of RI: anticipation, reflexivity, deliberation, responsiveness and participation. The different RI dimensions are applied in practice in a focus group discussion (FGD) and a round of interviews with different stakeholders that explored CO2 utilisation in the country. Hofstede's classification of national cultural dimensions is used to single out key focus points for attention in these RI processes in the Indonesian context. The results from the experiment illustrate that culture matters in the application of RI dimensions in practice. In the sense that in order for RI to work well, the governance of core RI processes such as participation and deliberation has to be adjusted to social norms of what is considered legitimate, desirable and good behaviour. These norms differ across societies. The findings further suggest ways of applying RI dimensions in practice.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101306,WOS,Journal

Despite the adsorption of pharmaceuticals on biochars is one of the most cost-effective and eco-friendly removal methods, the wide variation of experimental designs and research aims among previous studies pose significant challenge in selecting biochar for optimal removal. In this work, literature data of 1033 sets with 21 variables collected from 267 papers over ten years (2010â€“2020) covering 19 pharmaceuticals onto 88 biochars were assessed by different machine learning (ML) algorithms i.e., Linear regression model (LM), Feed-forward neural networks (NNET), Deep neutral networks (DNN), Cubist, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and Random forest (RF), to predict equilibrium adsorption capacity (Qe) and explore adsorption mechanisms. LM showed the best performance on ranking importance of input variables. Except for initial concentration of pharmaceuticals, Qe was strongly governed by biochars' properties including specific surface area (BET), pore volume (PV), and pore structure (PS) rather than pharmaceuticalsâ€™ properties and experimental conditions. The most accurate model for estimating Qe was achieved by Cubist, followed by KNN, RF, KNN, NNET and LM. The generalization ability was observed by the tuned Cubist with 26 rules for the prediction of the unseen data. This study not only provides an insightful evidence for data-based adsorption mechanisms of pharmaceuticals on biochars, but also offers a potential method to accurately predict the biochar adsorption performance without conducting any experiments, which will be of high interests in practice in terms of water/wastewater treatment using biochars.

Design/methodology: In this study, main arguments from intellectual capital, strategic human resource management (SHRM) and multilevel literature are integrated. The intellectual capital literature provides our model with the input (human capital), mechanisms (social capital) and the infrastructure (organizational capital) required to create ambidextrous capabilities. The multilevel perspective reveals the context in which ambidexterity is reached, and the SHRM provide the model with the specific mechanisms (policies and practices) and conditions required by ambidexterity (HRM flexibility and horizontal fit). Findings: Although the literature widely recognizes ambidexterity as a potential source of sustainable competitive advantage, the processes by which organizations complement exploration and exploitation activities still remain unclear. This study sheds some light on the analysis of these complex dynamics, explaining how ambidextrous capabilities can arise from different alternative combinations of human, social and organizational capital. Originality/value: The paper expands the extant literature in the field, describing different paths to achieving organizational ambidexterity. The configurational approach adopted adds value to the proposed model, as it helps to explaining alternative synergistic mixes of ambidextrous intellectual capital at different organizational levels.",2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.3926/ic.972,WOS,Journal

This study focuses on the impact of platform characteristics on users' behavior. Specifically, the purpose of this study is to investigate (1) what factors affect users' learning and dissemination of knowledge and information on social media platforms, (2) whether knowledge and information learning behavior will have a positive effect on sharing behavior and (3) try to establish an impact model of users' learning and sharing behavior about knowledge and information. Design/methodology/approach - This study proposes an impact mechanism model to test these hypotheses. To achieve this, the authors collected data from 430 users who have used the social media platforms to acquire and share knowledge and information to test the hypothesis. The tools SPSS 26.0 and AMOS 23.0 were used to analyze the reliability, validity, model fits and structural equation modeling. Findings - The results show that the learning of knowledge and information can influence the sharing behavior on social media platforms. Users' platform-based trust and platform-based satisfaction affect their knowledge and information learning and sharing on the platform. Factors affecting users' trust in social platforms include privacy protection effectiveness and network effects. And, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are related to users' satisfaction with social media platforms. Originality/value - This study constructs an impact model on the learning and sharing of knowledge and information.

Therefore, grid flexibility has become a key factor in power systems. This study focuses on demand response business models (DRBMs), which have great potential for fostering energy flexibility in a cost-efflcient and sustainable manner. Based on the literature review and empirical data from a case study, a business model analytical framework is proposed to explore the demand response potential based on value proposition, value creation and delivery, and value capture. This DRBM framework is characterised by nine elements: flexibility product, flexibility market segment, service attributes, demand response resources, resource availability, demand response mechanism, communication channels, cost structures, and revenue model. Based on this framework, a visualisation tool is proposed to help researchers and practitioners understand, integrate, and develop flexible electricity products. The application of this tool is then presented for electric vehicles as an example. The tool is valuable for evaluating the initial and untapped potentials of commercial demand response in electricity markets. This study thus contributes to the body of demand response literature via development of a holistic approach to assist recognition and creation of business models in emerging electricity markets.

DNA N6-methyladenine (6mA) plays a key role in many biology regulation processes. An accurate and reliable genome-wide identification of 6mA sites is crucial for systematically understanding its biological functions. Some machine learning tools can identify 6mA sites, but their limited prediction accuracy and lack of robustness limit their usability in epigenetic studies, which implies the great need of developing new computational methods for this problem. In this paper, we developed a novel computational predictor, namely the 6mAPred-MSFF, which is a deep learning framework based on a multi-scale feature fusion mechanism to identify 6mA sites across different species. In the predictor, we integrate the inverted residual block and multi-scale attention mechanism to build lightweight and deep neural networks. As compared to existing predictors using traditional machine learning, our deep learning framework needs no prior knowledge of 6mA or manually crafted sequence features and sufficiently capture better characteristics of 6mA sites. By benchmarking comparison, our deep learning method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the 5-fold cross-validation test on the seven datasets of six species, demonstrating that the proposed 6mAPred-MSFF is more effective and generic. Specifically, our proposed 6mAPred-MSFF gives the sensitivity and specificity of the 5-fold cross-validation on the 6mA-rice-Lv dataset as 97.88% and 94.64%, respectively. Our model trained with the rice data predicts well the 6mA sites of other five species: Arabidopsis thaliana, Fragaria vesca, Rosa chinensis, Homo sapiens, and Drosophila melanogaster with a prediction accuracy 98.51%, 93.02%, and 91.53%, respectively. Moreover, via experimental comparison, we explored performance impact by training and testing our proposed model under different encoding schemes and feature descriptors.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app11167731,WOS,Journal

Moving toward thirdgeneration universities (3rd GU) is an inevitable process. These universities need different functions than traditional ones; therefore, identifying and determining their functions is essential. The purpose of this study is to collect, match and explore the functions of universities in the transition to 3rd GU and ultimately offer a functional model of the 3rd GU for the use of professors, academics and policymakers in order to evaluate and promote universities. Methods: A critical review method was adapted. Literature was included based on their relevant empirical data to research objectives and referral rates, and texts with more conceptual richness entered the study without time limitations. Results: A total of 20 texts were included in the final analysis. While presenting the basic model, extracts the overarching concepts associated with the success of 3rd GU. These key concepts include the 7 core functions of innovative and entrepreneurial activities, supportive activities (financial and non-financial), entrepreneurial education (curriculum and academic workforce empowerment), creation and provide applied knowledge, boundary-spanning function or communications and interactions with other elements of the national innovation system (state and industry), develop innovative and entrepreneurial culture and institutional governance and leadership in the direction of economic growth and development. Conclusion: Using new functions at universities would be a move toward 3rd GU, economic growth and development in the country. So, these functions are a practically useful guide to policymakers to estimate the rate of success in each university and deliver the necessary suggestions to provide the mechanisms for the establishment of a successful university.

Recently, mHealth-related technology is expected to form a new category of medical devices particularly in the monitoring of patients. This is also anticipated to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of pharmaceutical clinical trials. However, there are challenges to utilize this enabling technology to innovate healthcare business. Considering this context, we explore the potential of mHealth. First, we position mHealth with respect to current innovation theories based on intensive literature review. Second, we hypothesize that mHealth has two potential areas of innovation: product innovation in the medical devices industry and process innovation in the pharmaceutical industry. To test the hypotheses, we conducted a holistic observation on clinical trials to examine how large mHealth impacts a treatment pathway by innovative products. Consequently, we observed 193 studies are registered; however, most of these remain at a primitive level of information and communication technology such as text messaging and application, which suggests a significant gap to the market forecasts. This present study forms the basis of the trend of mHealth and a future outlook from the viewpoint of technology and innovation management.

The vast majority of these manufactured foams are homogeneous with respect to porosity and structural properties. In contrast, while cellular materials are also ubiquitous in nature, nature mostly fabricates heterogeneous foams, e.g., cellulosic plant stems like bamboo, or a human femur bone. Foams with such engineered porosity distribution (graded density structure) have useful property gradients and are referred to as functionally graded foams. Functionally graded polymer foams are one of the key emerging innovations in polymer foam technology. They allow enhancement in properties such as energy absorption, more efficient use of material, and better design for specific applications, such as helmets and tissue restorative scaffolds. Here, following an overview of key processing parameters for polymer foams, we explore recent developments in processing functionally graded polymer foams and their emerging structures and properties. Processes can be as simple as utilizing different surface materials from which the foam forms, to as complex as using microfluidics.

First, the literature on the expansion of the use of social media in enhancing GPI was reviewed to develop the theoretical framework and hypotheses. Then, data collected from 211 manufacturing firms were analysed using structural equation modelling to examine the proposed relationship. The results revealed that SMU does not directly influence GPI. Rather, internal environmental collaboration (IEC) and environmental collaboration with suppliers (ECS) fully mediate the relationship between SMU and GPI. The results further disclosed a positive relationship between IEC and ECS, where both types of environmental collaboration seem to be key factors in improving GPI.

Our study explores whether inventing teams that span basic and clinical research are more effective at licensing than teams comprised of inventors from only one domain. We propose that laboratory science and clinical research represent fundamentally different research paradigms that defy a simple arithmetic of combining the skills of individuals on teams. Clinical and basic researchers inhabit distinct cultures of work that yield different, and sometimes conflicting, beliefs and approaches to problem-solving. We claim that the complexity and variability of most human medical problems limits the role of basic science in medical innovation. Instead, we argue that clinical research remains an important engine of innovation, even in a period of rapid advances in molecular and genetics sciences, and advanced analytical techniques, because clinical researchers have unique opportunities for insights that emerge from the joint activities of research and close observations of living patients. Our empirical analysis focuses on patents and licenses from two prominent Academic Medical Centers (AMCs) over a 30 year period. In hazard models of licensing we find, controlling for a range of effects, that inventions by teams composed of clinical researchers (MDs) are more likely to be licensed than inventions by teams of basic scientists (PhDs), and that inventions that include both MDs and PhDs are not more likely to be licensed. This leads us to question the translational model of combining expertise to bridge different domains. We also find that the training of the team leader has an effect on licensing that is independent of team composition, lending support to our interpretation. Our results help inform policy about the relationship between research paradigms, team composition, and successful innovation in bio-medicine. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Startup teams are integrated or internal projects teams are provided with office space, independence and resources. Corporate incubators have become a promising solution for companies that aim at achieving structural ambidexterity, i.e. organizational ambidexterity that is embedded in corporate structure. While the current business practice shows that many different configurations of corporate incubators exist, the underlying requirements remain unclear. This paper therefore addresses the research gap by deriving a model describing the requirements for the organizational structure of corporate incubators. The authors draw from organization theory in order to derive requirement dimensions. Then, current literature on ambidexterity research is used to infer requirement parameters for each requirement dimension. From a practitioner's perspective, the developed model allows a systematic planning process that helps achieving a consistent configuration of corporate incubators, which reduces failure rates.

Knowledge development from the KI process has been assessed by exploring the interaction between (1) domain-specific knowledge, (2) procedural knowledge and (3) general knowledge, complementing the established emphasis on tacit and explicit knowledge found in relevant construction management research. The findings indicate that general knowledge needs to be high for increased BIM diffusion and the research raises the need to develop procedural knowledge both from a practical and research perspective.

Thus, the functional role of metacognition in process improvement practices (PIP) is quite different from the role of cognition. Metacognition has been studied in several disciplines, including education, psychology, and neuroscience; however, research has yet to address the role of metacognition in an operations management context. Thus, the present study explored how a process improvement leader's metacognitive awareness influences PIP effectiveness. A survey was conducted with process improvement leaders from U.S.-based firms. Results revealed that managerial metacognition was positively related to adaptive PIP performance within the organization. There was also a positive synergistic relationship between managerial metacognition and PIP implementation on a firm's competitive advantage. We discussed practical and theoretical implications as well as future research agendas for how managerial metacognitive skills can be utilized for advantageous operational activities. This study not only contributes to the operations literature by providing new insights into the relationship between psychological and methodological mechanisms in PIP implementation but also provides the first step toward theory-building in terms of metacognition concepts in operations management.

Design/methodology/approach By adopting Douglas and Shepherd's utility-maximising function, the influence of one entrepreneurial university ecosystem on graduates' career choices was tested using a sample of 11,512 graduates from the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education (ITESM) in Mexico. Findings Our results show the critical role of entrepreneurial universities ecosystems in facilitating employability options as academic entrepreneurship for ITESM's graduates. The study shows some insights about how graduates' risk aversion and work effort are positively influenced by the university business incubator and entrepreneurship education programs, respectively. Practical implications Diverse implications for stakeholders have emerged from our results. These implications are associated with potential benefits of implementing programmes oriented to engage academic entrepreneurship within Latin American universities. Originality/value Entrepreneurial universities provide a range of employability alternatives for their students, such as to be self-employed, academic entrepreneurs or paid employees. In this scenario, entrepreneurial universities have configured entrepreneurial ecosystems (educational programmes, business incubators and other infrastructures) to support potential entrepreneurs (students, academics, staff and alumni). Despite the relevance of the environmental conditions on individuals' occupational choices, few studies have explored the role of the entrepreneurial university ecosystems on graduates' employability. In this vein, our study contributes to some academic discussions: (1) the role of context on career choice models (Ilouga et al., 2014; Sieger and Monsen, 2015), (2) the role of incubators and entrepreneurship education on fostering academic entrepreneurship on the graduates' community (Nabi et al., 2017; Good et al., 2019; Guerrero and Urbano, 2019a) and (3) the effectiveness of the entrepreneurial university ecosystems on graduates' employability (Herrera et al., 2018; Wright et al., 2017).",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JMD-10-2019-0439,WOS,Journal

The mechanisms for PC technology adoption have yet to be defined, which inhibits its diffusion in the construction market. This study aims to reveal the intrinsic motivation and action mechanism for PC technology adoption. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on the technology acceptance model (TAM), the study integrates characteristics from the diffusion of innovation theory to propose a multifaceted model for explaining practitioners' PC technology adoption behavior from technology, organization and environment contexts. The proposed theoretical model was empirically examined via a survey of 234 professionals in mainland China using the partial least squares-structural equation modeling technique. Findings The outcomes indicated that relative advantage, corporate social responsibility and market demand are significantly positively related to practitioners' perceived usefulness from PC technology. Regulatory support and trading partner support have noticeable positive effects on practitioners' perceived ease of use from PC technology. Perceived ease of use is found to positively influence perceived usefulness, and both of them have a positive influence on the attitude toward adopting PC technology. Attitude is further confirmed as an important predictor of adoption intention, which would lead to actual PC technology adoption behavior. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to explore industry perceptions toward PC technology adoption, providing valuable guidance for the effective diffusion of PC technology and laying a reliable foundation for research on other construction innovation adoption in post-COVID-19.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/ECAM-07-2021-0613,WOS,Journal

It plays a vital role in various machine learning applications and recently has attracted tremendous attention across different communities. In this paper, we explore different adversarial scenarios in the context of quantum machine learning. We find that, similar to traditional classifiers based on classical neural networks, quantum learning systems are likewise vulnerable to crafted adversarial examples, independent of whether the input data is classical or quantum. In particular, we find that a quantum classifier that achieves nearly the state-of-the-art accuracy can be conclusively deceived by adversarial examples obtained via adding imperceptible perturbations to the original legitimate samples. This is explicitly demonstrated with quantum adversarial learning in different scenarios, including classifying real-life images (e.g., handwritten digit images in the dataset MNIST), learning phases of matter (such as ferromagnetic/paramagnetic orders and symmetry protected topological phases), and classifying quantum data. Furthermore, we show that based on the information of the adversarial examples at hand, practical defense strategies can be designed to fight against a number of different attacks. Our results uncover the notable vulnerability of quantum machine learning systems to adversarial perturbations, which not only reveals another perspective in bridging machine learning and quantum physics in theory but also provides valuable guidance for practical applications of quantum classifiers based on both near-term and future quantum technologies.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.033212,WOS,Journal

This is identified as an ambiguous phenomenon which could instantiate more integrated and collaborative models of planning or, alternatively, denote an intensified economic focus. The implications of the green adaptation-urban regeneration nexus are explored through two case studies of combined climate adaptation and regeneration projects in Sheffield and Copenhagen. The key finding is that both projects' institutional setting within pre-existing regeneration planning frameworks has been a key influence in both enabling and constraining community participation.

As diversity in higher education increases and accelerating technology adoption impacts on teaching, improving the quality of the instructive-educational process becomes fundamental based on understanding, observing, and re-evaluating the differences amongst our students. At the higher education level, our students are even more diverse than K-12 students due to their academic experiences and professional interests. Our learners differ not only culturally or linguistically, but also in their cognitive abilities, learning preferences, background knowledge, and have various levels of strengths and weaknesses in the area of multiple intelligences; hence a rethinking of the structure and management of the classroom, modifying curricula and maximizing classroom interactions are necessary. Differentiated activities together with Web 2.0 tools and mobile-assisted language learning applications can enhance collaborative learning where learners actively participate in groups to explore a topic or discuss to finalize a project. Differentiation or academically responsive instruction concentrates on teaching strategies that provide students with multiple pathways in the teaching and learning process to meet their needs. Mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) is a subarea of mobile learning in which integration of new mobile technologies into teaching and language learning has been a primary focus, and numerous mobile applications and online Web 2.0 tools have been developed to support academic English language learning, including reading, listening, writing, speaking, functional grammar and vocabulary. Web 2.0 refers to a huge array of web-based tools such as blogs, wikis, folksonomies, social networking sites and content-sharing sites which can offer numerous instructional opportunities like active engagement, personalized learning and innovation, and can empower and enable learners to participate in a variety of ways. This qualitative study explored the integration of MALL applications and Web 2.0 tools in differentiated EAP classes and sought to understand how they can assist in improving collaboration of EAP students to achieve higher levels of cognitive learning in higher education in UAE. The findings suggest that the usage of MALL apps and Web 2.0 tools in differentiated EAP classes in higher education assist students in terms of feedback, motivation, collaboration, pace, multi-modality and research skills; gives them an opportunity to choose the activity and the type of assessment that corresponds to their needs and abilities.

Therefore, cities become contexts where cultural and creative practices can be implemented, integrating social cohesion principles based on communities, shared values, and collaborative decision-making approaches, with particular attention to enhancing cultural heritage, mainly unused or underutilised. The purpose of this research is to explore how the Cultural and Creative Cities Monitor (CCCM) methodological framework, developed by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, can be integrated at the local scale to assess the impacts of urban regeneration processes in an interactive and dynamic way, through the data emerging from the monitoring of urban regeneration experiences activated with the communities. The paper describes the Play ReCH (Re-use Cultural Heritage)  approach, that promotes a process of collaboration, gamification, and innovation in cultural heritage reuse, as an opportunity to test how cultural, creative, and community-led urban strategies can support the enhancement of heritage generating enabling environments and culturally vibrant contexts. The Play ReCH approach and the Hack the City Salerno  mission, activated in the Salerno historic centre (Italy), open the reflection on some relevant issues related to how citizens become makers of cultural and creative cities' policies, and contribute to evaluating and monitoring their implementation at diverse urban scales.

(2020),From industrial cities to smart cities,"26th International Association for Management of Technology Conference, IAMOT 2017",Creative industry; Industrial organization; Innovation; Smart cities,,"Cities concentrate a series of externalities for the accomplishment of economic activities, as well as for the daily life. The proximity to shopping centers, entertainment, universities and so on make cities a hub of transactions. However, if on the one hand, a city brings people together, generating business, shortening transaction costs, and facilitating life; on the other hand, environmental, social and institutional costs resulting from industrial society which generates negative externalities. The economic paradigm emerging in the 21st century is mainly focused on knowledge, technology and innovation. Within this scenario, brainwork has become the most valuable economic asset, bypassing machines and simply workforce. However, creative people seek for a place that offers high conditions for living, working and entertaining. It is important to stimulate the establishment of new ventures based on knowledge and creativity, and the interaction between these ventures with S&amp;T institutions to rise up their technological base and promote innovation. Therefore, cities must be planned and structured to facilitate a whole innovation ecosystem in which knowledge flows smoothly, involving these individuals' way of life, as well as businesses and S&amp;T institutions dynamics. Industrial cities must be transformed into smart cities, in which the state-of-the-art knowledge is applied to develop enough economic added value solutions to generate wealth and quality of life, based on existing and new resources. Thus, to become a smart city, it is required a set of new assumptions in several different dimensions to attract and retain creative and talented people, allowing them to properly use their capacities. Smart cities may provide the necessary infrastructure so businesses, individually or through public or private partnerships, use ICTs to create goods, services, or even a sustainable product-service system, that solve urban problems and, along with it, raise the intellectual potential of the city and its competitiveness. However, what is lacking to industrial cities move forward into this new paradigm? Do cities present basic conditions to develop a new innovation ecosystem? This paper aims to sketch up the baselines of a comprehensive smart city conceptual framework. To do so, a theoretical discussion was promoted, through the review of different smart city definitions, and to further explore the basics of a smart city, a workshop and focus groups were conducted with key actors to validate a framework involving all the basics to establish a smart city.

(2018),Closing the Skills Gap: Construction and Engineering Education Using Mixed Reality - A Case Study,2018 IEEE FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE (FIE),,,"This research work-in-progress paper investigated the application of emerging mixed reality (MR) technology in construction and engineering education. The construction industry is facing a severe shortage of skilled workforce. As the baby boomers are retiring, the younger generation, especially college students, are often criticized for their lack of professional experience and career-specific competency. To close the skills gap and accelerate the transition of college students to competent workforce, this paper proposed a new genre of learning and professional training using MR.

The construction industry is facing a severe shortage of skilled workforce. As the baby boomers are retiring, the younger generation, especially college students, are often criticized for their lack of professional experience and career-specific competency. To close the skills gap and accelerate the transition of college students to competent workforce, this paper proposed a new genre of learning and professional training using MR. The main promise of the MR technology resides in its ability to augment virtual contents on top of the physical reality to facilitate tacit knowledge learning, and simulate learning activities that traditionally can only be obtained from actual professional experience.

The existing literature mainly considers strengthening adaptive capacity as a steady and linear process. This article explores possibilities to fast track positive adaptive capacity trajectories of small-scale farmers in the Northern Region of Ghana. Leverage points were identified by triangulating data from semi-structured interviews with farmers (n=72), key informant interviews (n=7) and focus group discussions (FG1 n=17; FG2 n=20). The results present two ways to approach adaptation planning: 1) using four generic leverage points (gender equality, social learning, information and knowledge, and access to finance) or 2) combining the adaptive capacity and leverage point frameworks, thereby creating 15 associations. The generic points provide a set of topics as a starting point for policy and intervention planning activities, while the 15 associations support the identification of place-specific leverage points. Four benefits of using leverage points for adaptive capacity in adaptation planning were identified: guidance on where to intervene in a system, ability to deal with complex systems, inclusion of both causal and teleological decision-making, and a possibility to target deep, transformative change.

(2020),A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Global Routing,JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN,,10.1115/1.4045044,"Global routing has been a historically challenging problem in the electronic circuit design, where the challenge is to connect a large and arbitrary number of circuit components with wires without violating the design rules for the printed circuit boards or integrated circuits. Similar routing problems also exist in the design of complex hydraulic systems, pipe systems, and logistic networks. Existing solutions typically consist of greedy algorithms and hard-coded heuristics. As such, existing approaches suffer from a lack of model flexibility and usually fail to solve sub-problems conjointly. As an alternative approach, this work presents a deep reinforcement learning method for solving the global routing problem in a simulated environment. At the heart of the proposed method is deep reinforcement learning that enables an agent to produce a policy for routing based on the variety of problems, and it is presented with leveraging the conjoint optimization mechanism of deep reinforcement learning. Conjoint optimization mechanism is explained and demonstrated in detail; the best network structure and the parameters of the learned model are explored. Based on the fine-tuned model, routing solutions and rewards are presented and analyzed. The results indicate that the approach can outperform the benchmark method of a sequential A* method, suggesting a promising potential for deep reinforcement learning for global routing and other routing or path planning problems in general. Another major contribution of this work is the development of a global routing problem sets generator with the ability to generate parameterized global routing problem sets with different size and constraints, enabling evaluation of different routing algorithms and the generation of training datasets for future data-driven routing approaches.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/1.4045044,WOS,Journal

However, early decisions set the path to cost and schedule performance and influence life cycle costs. This study explored project validation as a novel set-based and concurrent design practice during the conceptual phase of complex projects. Because the construction literature obviates set-based design, a grounded theory method was leveraged to elicit a theoretical model that gave primacy to contextual and inductive evidence. The emerging theory guided the data collection, which included interviews, three expert workshops, and observations at validation sessions. Project validation aims at proving or disproving with null design whether the team can deliver a project that satisfies the owner's business case and scope within the owner's allowable constraints of costs, schedule, and acceptable risks. Also, it defines the basis of design and target costs and informs the owner's decision to authorize (go) or not to authorize (no-go) the project. As a departure from the existing literature rooted in point-based design and programming approaches, decisions on concurrent sets of cross-functional design alternatives are purposely delayed during project validation. In doing so, the accumulation of additional information will, later on, enable the team to make design decisions with a systems engineering and value-adding perspective that drives innovation. The results of this study contribute to the advancement of design theory methodology and project definition.

Previous work tends to use complex attention mechanisms to capture contextual relevance between question-answer (QA) pairs while ignoring large scale commonsense knowledge. However, this commonsense knowledge provides real-world background information beyond the context, which can help to discover the latent relevance between two sentences. In this paper, we propose to integrate commonsense from the external knowledge graphs (KGs) into the answer selector through a knowledge-aware context-based attention mechanism. To explore the interrelations among knowledge and context, we leverage a compare-aggregate framework to capture more interactive features between questions and answers.

Findings Contrary to existing evidence from western contexts, this study finds that property rights changes have a significant influence on the investment of both forms of capital toward necessity entrepreneurship in China. Research limitations/implications The use of a secondary database like GEM has certain limitations, such as the non-availability of data on a longitudinal basis, and the need to operationalize certain constructs like social and financial capital as non-continuous variables.

One of the key barriers to improving the energy efficiency of cities is the ability to accurately model and characterize the energy performance of their buildings.

Our results indicate that the DUE-S model is able to capture the energy impacts that the urban context has on buildings that undergo retrofits as well as those that do not.

Particularly, it aims to examine the role of adaptive marketing capability in enabling market ambidexterity and incremental as well as radical product innovation. Also it intends to investigate the moderating role of transformational leadership between adaptive marketing capability and market ambidexterity. Design/methodology/approach Manufacturing firms in Pakistan, an emerging economy, are taken as the context for this study. A designed survey questionnaire is used for data collection. Partial least square technique is employed to empirically validate and test the hypothesized model with a sample of 192 manufacturing firms. Particularly, the two-stage approach in SmartPLS is used to validate measurement models, and structural equation modeling technique is used to test the proposed hypothesis. Findings The findings not only confirm that adaptive marketing capability is instrumental to both incremental and radical product innovations but also reveal that adaptive marketing capability serves an important antecedent to market ambidexterity shedding new lights on its mediating role in the relationship of adaptive marketing capability with incremental and radical product innovations. Moreover, the results find that the effectiveness of adaptive marketing capability to support market ambidexterity may involve a possible trade-off between exploitation and exploration when the leaders exhibit a low or high level of transformational leadership behavior. Originality/value This study contributes to outside-in strategic perspective and contextual ambidexterity literature by revealing the role of adaptive marketing capability as an important enabler of market ambidexterity which, in turn, allows the firm to simultaneously introduce incremental and radical product innovations. In this way, this study advances the current understanding of the antecedents and consequences of contextual ambidexterity. Also, this study provides insight into the types of capabilities needed for the firm's contextual and employees' behavioral adaptation to simultaneously manage exploitation and exploration within the same business unit which was lacking in the previous literature. Further, this study also offers a novel understanding of the conditional role of transformational leadership between adaptive marketing capability and market ambidexterity.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EJIM-12-2020-0520,WOS,Journal

The valuable local environmental and scientific knowledge (LESK) of dryland SESs is crucial for adaptive governance but remains scarce. Here, we proposed an analytical framework to understand the LESK in relation to the mechanisms of ecological policy-household interactions and ecological performance of resource systems. According to this framework, we explored LESK by linking land surface dynamics and investigations of policy and households in a typical dryland region, Minqin. We reported that ecological policy contributed to significant socio-ecological benefits, including increased water resources, land desertification reduction, and natural vegetation restoration. However, there exist conflicting aspects, demonstrated by the encroachment of agricultural land, which increases the land degradation risk of oasis. These results implied that top-down ecological policy and bottom-up household responses caused both positive and negative LDN outcomes, which can be attributed to collective and conflicted actions between the self-interest orientation of multiple stakeholders. By investigating households, we found that education-induced economic need was one of the major drivers for the conflicted actions on the policy of agricultural land reduction. Therefore, we proposed a series of adaptive measurements to balance short-term economic concerns and long-term LDN. This study also highlighted that navigated LESK should be considered for future sustainable management and ecosystem modeling.

Current research acknowledges the lack of representation of women in STEM and reports on challenges and barriers to recruiting, retaining, and advancing women in these fields. Engineering educators recognise the need for the profession to diversify, to be more inclusive, and that innovation and entrepreneurial mindsets are required for engineering leaders in the future. Traditional career ladders are dissolving and we understand better the new models of boundaryless and protean (self-directed and values-driven) careers that span across work units, organisations and sectors, including self-employment. The future of engineering education requires learning designers to better understand how to develop the mindsets required for orienteering the many transitions in the careers of the future. If we are to support the careers of women in STEM we need to understand the nature of their career paths and choices. This qualitative research used semi-structured interviews to explore the career narratives of women in STEM, focusing on the career decision making and individual perceptions of career choices associated with career shifts or pivots. With reference to the literature on career choice, mindsets and motivations, an inductive and thematic analysis was conducted and descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data. We looked at the career paths of women in STEM in terms of their career patterns, locus of control, career context, career age and stage, career sponsorship, and their experiences in entrepreneurial ventures. A framework has been developed for characterising and understanding women's choices and the mindsets that enable success. This framework will enable us to identify approaches and tools that are useful for women to evaluate their own mindsets and design their career choices. The results can be used to inform the design of resources and interventions that support the retainment and advancement of women in STEM, developing an intentional change mindset, and supporting career choices from undergraduate level to continuous professional development education. This new framework for career development is emerging and integrates knowledge from educational research and professional experience of women to enable educators, coaches, people managers, and human resource professionals to better prepare women and organisations for the future of work.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637159,WOS,Conference Paper

We explore a novel representation that automatically breaks up products into fine-grained functional aspects capturing the purposes and mechanisms of ideas, and use it to support important creative innovation interactions: functional search for ideas, and exploration of the design space around a focal problem by viewing related problem perspectives pooled from across many products.

Removing abortion from the criminal framework could permit new service delivery models. We explore service delivery models in primary care settings that can improve accessibility without negatively impacting the safety and efficiency of abortion services. Novel service delivery models are common in low-and-middle income countries (LMICs) due to resource constraints, and services are sometimes provided by trained, mid-level providers via ""task-shifting"". The aim of this study is to explore the quality of early abortion services provided in primary care of LMICs and explore the potential benefits of extending their application to the UK context. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, Maternity and Infant Care, CINAHL, and HMIC for studies published from September 1994 to February 2020, with search terms ""nurses"", ""midwives"", ""general physicians"", ""early medical/surgical abortion"". We included studies that examined the quality of abortion care in primary care settings of low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs), and excluded studies in countries where abortion is illegal, and those of services provided by independent NGOs. We conducted a thematic analysis and narrative synthesis to identify indicators of quality care at structural, process and outcome levels of the Donabedian model. Results: A total of 21 indicators under 8 subthemes were identified to examine the quality of service provision: law and policy, infrastructure, technical competency, information provision, client-provider interactions, ancillary services, complete abortions, client satisfaction. Our analysis suggests that structural, process and outcome indicators follow a mediation pathway of the Donabedian model. This review showed that providing early medical abortion in primary care services is safe and feasible and ""task-shifting""to mid-level providers can effectively replace doctors in providing abortion. Conclusion: The way services are organised in LMICs, using a task-shifted and decentralised model, results in high quality services that should be considered for adoption in the UK. Collaboration with professional medical bodies and governmental departments is necessary to expand services from secondary to primary care.

Current research suggests that in-vehicle Controller Area Network-BUS (CAN-BUS) data can be used as an effective representation of driving behavior for recognizing different drivers. However, it is difficult to capture complex temporal features of driving behaviors in traditional methods. This paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning framework by fusing convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks with an attention mechanism, which is more suitable for time series CAN-BUS sensor data. The proposed method can automatically learn features of driving behaviors and model temporal features without professional knowledge in features modeling. Moreover, the method can capture salient structure features of high-dimensional sensor data and explore the correlations among multi-sensor data for rich feature representations of driving behaviors.

From a healthcare perspective, process improvement models have mainly focused on the static workflow viewpoint. The objective of this article is to study and model the dynamic nature of healthcare delivery, allowing us to identify where potential issues exist within the service system and to examine how Connected Health technological solutions may support service efficiencies. We explore the application of social network analysis (SNA) as a modelling technique which captures the dynamic nature of a healthcare service. We demonstrate how it can be used to map the â€˜Careflow Networkâ€™ and guide Connected Health innovators to examine specific opportunities within the healthcare service. Our results indicate that healthcare technology must be correctly identified and implemented within the Careflow Network to enjoy improvements in service delivery. Oftentimes, prior to making the transformation to Connected Health, researchers use various modelling techniques that fail to identify where Connected Health innovation is best placed in a healthcare service network. Using SNA allows us to develop an understanding of the current operation of healthcare system within which they can effect change. It is important to identify and model the resource exchanges to ensure that the quality and safety of care are enhanced, efficiencies are increased and the overall healthcare service system is improved. We have shown that dynamic models allow us to study the exchange of resources. These are often intertwined within a socio-technical context in an informal manner and not accounted for in static models, yet capture a truer insight on the operations of a Careflow Network.

These diseases involving fibrosis may share common mechanisms and therapeutic targets, and therefore common intervention strategies and medicines may be applicable for these diseases. For this reason, deliberately introducing anti-fibrosis characteristics into predictive modeling may lead to more success in drug repositioning. In this study, anti-fibrosis knowledge base was first built by collecting data from multiple resources. Both structural and biological profiles were then derived from the knowledge base and used for constructing machine learning models including Structural Profile Prediction Model (SPPM) and Biological Profile Prediction Model (BPPM). Three external public data sets were employed for validation purpose and further exploration of potential repositioning drugs in wider chemical space. The resulting SPPM and BPPM models achieve area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (area under the curve) of 0.879 and 0.972 in the training set, and 0.814 and 0.874 in the testing set. Additionally, our results also demonstrate that substantial amount of multi-targeting natural products possess notable anti-fibrosis characteristics and might serve as encouraging candidates in fibrosis treatment and drug repositioning.

Perhaps, no better example of this can be found than the rapid developments in Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR), that have recently made the step from the laboratories and specialized, bespoke training applications of the past, to the mainstream. Advances in VR/AR have opened the floodgates to digital internships, virtual labs, and novel collaborative and experiential learning. The magnitude and impact of these emerging technologies is also evident on the significant interest in their application and use in various commercial, professional, and industrial contexts. Examples of these include, but are not limited to, the entertainment industries, specialized training, corporate demonstrations and conferencing, and prototyping and modelling in the technical and engineering areas. Since universities play a vital role in moulding tomorrow's talents, integrating such technologies can help them not only by supporting teaching and learning, but also by contributing to related research and enhancing the learning technology frameworks in their entirety. The aim of this research paper is to briefly discuss the position of these emerging technologies in the educational sector in general, and explore what their role, impact, and structure may be in the educational systems of the future with a focus on higher education in the U.A.E.

(2022),Protein Science Meets Artificial Intelligence: A Systematic Review and a Biochemical Meta-Analysis of an Inter-Field,FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY,,10.3389/fbioe.2022.788300,"Proteins are some of the most fascinating and challenging molecules in the universe, and they pose a big challenge for artificial intelligence. The implementation of machine learning/AI in protein science gives rise to a world of knowledge adventures in the workhorse of the cell and proteome homeostasis, which are essential for making life possible. This opens up epistemic horizons thanks to a coupling of human tacit-explicit knowledge with machine learning power, the benefits of which are already tangible, such as important advances in protein structure prediction. Moreover, the driving force behind the protein processes of self-organization, adjustment, and fitness requires a space corresponding to gigabytes of life data in its order of magnitude. There are many tasks such as novel protein design, protein folding pathways, and synthetic metabolic routes, as well as protein-aggregation mechanisms, pathogenesis of protein misfolding and disease, and proteostasis networks that are currently unexplored or unrevealed. In this systematic review and biochemical meta-analysis, we aim to contribute to bridging the gap between what we call binomial artificial intelligence (AI) and protein science (PS), a growing research enterprise with exciting and promising biotechnological and biomedical applications. We undertake our task by exploring the state of the art in AI and machine learning (ML) applications to protein science in the scientific literature to address some critical research questions in this domain, including What kind of tasks are already explored by ML approaches to protein sciences? What are the most common ML algorithms and databases used? What is the situational diagnostic of the AI-PS inter-field? What do ML processing steps have in common? We also formulate novel questions such as Is it possible to discover what the rules of protein evolution are with the binomial AI-PS? How do protein folding pathways evolve? What are the rules that dictate the folds? What are the minimal nuclear protein structures? How do protein aggregates form and why do they exhibit different toxicities? What are the structural properties of amyloid proteins? How can we design an effective proteostasis network to deal with misfolded proteins? We are a cross-functional group of scientists from several academic disciplines, and we have conducted the systematic review using a variant of the PICO and PRISMA approaches. The search was carried out in four databases (PubMed, Bireme, OVID, and EBSCO Web of Science), resulting in 144 research articles. After three rounds of quality screening, 93 articles were finally selected for further analysis. A summary of our findings is as follows: regarding AI applications, there are mainly four types: 1) genomics, 2) protein structure and function, 3) protein design and evolution, and 4) drug design. In terms of the ML algorithms and databases used, supervised learning was the most common approach (85%). As for the databases used for the ML models, PDB and UniprotKB/Swissprot were the most common ones (21 and 8%, respectively). Moreover, we identified that approximately 63% of the articles organized their results into three steps, which we labeled pre-process, process, and post-process. A few studies combined data from several databases or created their own databases after the pre-process. Our main finding is that, as of today, there are no research road maps serving as guides to address gaps in our knowledge of the AI-PS binomial. All research efforts to collect, integrate multidimensional data features, and then analyze and validate them are, so far, uncoordinated and scattered throughout the scientific literature without a clear epistemic goal or connection between the studies. Therefore, our main contribution to the scientific literature is to offer a road map to help solve problems in drug design, protein structures, design, and function prediction while also presenting the state of the art on research in the AI-PS binomial until February 2021. Thus, we pave the way toward future advances in the synthetic redesign of novel proteins and protein networks and artificial metabolic pathways, learning lessons from nature for the welfare of humankind. Many of the novel proteins and metabolic pathways are currently non-existent in nature, nor are they used in the chemical industry or biomedical field.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2022.788300,WOS,Journal

To achieve deep decarbonisation, recent scholarship identifies the crucial role of broad policy mixes that create reinforcing effects between climate and energy policies to trigger technological innovation, restrict polluting activities, promote green growth, and ensure just energy transitions. Drawing on this literature, the article explores the conditions for developing such policy mixes in the US context in three policy phases. How and why have key policy conditions developed differently in the climate- and energy policy fields, and to what effect for decarbonisation policies? The analysis shows that growing political polarisation blocked bipartisan agreement, produced negative policy feedback, and caused instability in the climate policy field, whereas these mechanisms did not dominate the energy policy field. A more bipartisan approach to renewable energy policy allowed long-term experience and positive feedback in energy-policy programmes that helped to trigger technology innovation and subsequent GHGÂ emissions cuts. Different policy conditions within these policy fields discouraged a coupling between them that could have facilitated green-growth policies. The economic shock caused by the coronavirus pandemic may potentially change policy conditions and build a path to deep US decarbonisation in the future, but only if political polarisation on climate change can be overcome.

A number of factors have resulted in the redistribution of manufacturing. Within Emerging Industries, advances in process and information technologies, have changed the physical and information characteristics of components and products, and the viable production economies of scale. Further, the emergence of new specialised companies fulfilling key research, production or service roles have changed industry structure and operations, and the conventional model of value creation. Six industrial systems are examined using an Industrial System mapping methodology providing a basis for cross-case analysis, selected on the basis of representing alternative and novel evolution paths that may provide insights into the characteristics of EI SNs within a redistributed manufacturing context. Cross-case analysis suggests several generic aspects to EI SNs, including the blurring of traditional industry boundaries and the critical requirement to manage uncertainty. Alternative forms of EI SNs are observed supporting particular EI evolution paths. Further, more adaptive SNs support increased product variety, with lower inventory models enabled by enhanced production and distribution flexibility, often located closer to demand.",2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2016.1214765,WOS,Journal

Introduction to alternative pathways of thinking and actions in an organization is typically tie-up with innovation nowadays. In this regard, the degrees of organizations willingness to engage and perceive advantage from new products or services, or products or services that embody new technology are being focused. Since leadership has been identified as a key determinant of organization innovation, a conceptual framework is proposed to explore the impact of entrepreneurial leadership on organization demand for innovation. Apart from the leadership behaviors, followersâ€™ characteristic and their own confidence level or perceived self-efficacy are also studied to capture the effect of innovative work behavior. Hence, this study aims to determine the moderating role of employeesâ€™ innovative self-efficacy on the relationship between entrepreneurial leadership and organization demand for innovation. A sample from Malaysia Top 100 companies is participated and the hypotheses are evaluated using partial least squares analysis. This research makes a significant contribution by providing empirical evidence that support entrepreneurial leaders and the organizations to generate more opportunities and enact them in ways that increase the firmâ€™s receptivity towards innovation.

Extending beyond previously published models that closely emulated the basic morphology of the fish, the new cross-step filter's major innovations are helical slots, radial symmetry, and rotation as an active anti-clogging mechanism. These innovations enable the transport of concentrated particles to the downstream end of the filter. This advance was made possible by recognizing that biologically imposed constraints such as bilateral symmetry do not apply to human-made filters. The use of helical slots was developed in a series of iterative tests that used water-tracing dye and algae-sized microspheres. The major products of the iterative tests were refinements in the helical design and an understanding of how varying the major structural parameters qualitatively influenced fluid flow and filter performance. Following the iterative tests, the clogging behavior of select filters was quantified at high particle concentrations. Vortices in the helical filter were effective at reducing clogging in the center of the slots. By considering the design space that is free of the biological constraints on the system and exploring the effects of variations in major structural parameters, our work has identified promising new directions for cross-step filtration and provided key insights into the biological system.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-3190/ab2d13,WOS,Journal

Clarifying the relationship between influencing factors and knowledge withholding is significant to improve the phenomenon of knowledge withholding in offline and online organizations. Few types of research focus on the online virtual academic community and integrate the three factors of knowledge, individual, and environment to research knowledge withholding. To solve the limitation, this research is based on sociology and psychology-related theories. The two dimensions of enabling and inhibition are divided into factors affecting knowledge withholding. An attempt is made to explore the path between the three types of factors influencing knowledge, individual and environment, and knowledge withholding. This study collected data from 616 users in China's virtual academic community. It used a structural equation model combined with a cross-layer connected neural network to conduct an empirical analysis on the proposed hypothesis. The results found that: in the virtual academic community, knowledge power in the enabling dimension is the main reason for users to form knowledge psychological ownership, which affects users' knowledge withholding. However, the effect of professional commitment on users' knowledge psychological ownership is not significant. After SEM-ANN model fitting, the combined inhibitory effect of community privacy protection and community reciprocity on user knowledge withholding in the inhibition dimension is significantly improved.

While deep reinforcement learning achieves significant success recently, the long and difficult training process limits its application. In this paper, we propose a hybrid structure named Option-Interruption in which human knowledge is embedded into a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework. Our architecture has two key components: options, represented by existing human-designed methods, can significantly speed up the training process and interruption mechanism, based on learnable termination functions, enables our system to timely terminate the current option according to the external environment. To implement this architecture, we derive a set of update rules based on policy gradient methods and present a complete training process.

Physical unclonable functions (PUF) are hardware security primitives useful for mitigating such issues by providing hardware-specific fingerprints based on intrinsic process variations within individual IC implementations. As technology scaling progresses further into the nanometer region, emerging nanoelectronic technologies, such as memristors or RRAMs (resistive random-Access memory), have become interesting options for emerging computing systems. In this article, using a comprehensive temperature dependent model of an HfOx (hafnium-oxide) memristor, based on experimental measurements, we explore the best region of operation for a memristive crossbar PUF (XbarPUF). The design considered also employs XORing and a column shuffling technique to improve reliability and resilience to machine learning attacks. We present a detailed analysis for the noise margin and discuss the scalability of the XbarPUF structure. Finally, we present results for estimates of area, power, and delay alongside security performance metrics to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the XbarPUF. Our XbarPUF exhibits nearly ideal (near 50%) uniqueness, bit-Aliasing and uniformity, good reliability of 90% and up (with 100% being ideal), a very small footprint, and low average power consumption â‰ˆ104Î¼W.

Current eco-design methods are not adapted to all the requirements of eco-innovation, because of 1) their complexity of implementation, 2) their low robustness and/or 3) their tendency to provide mostly techno-centred solutions. There is a need to define methods which can support multidisciplinary design teams to eco-innovate. In previous work, a set of seven didactical and meso Eco-ideation Stimulation Mechanisms (ESM) was developed, exploring systemic dimensions related to sustainability currently under-exploited.. The proposition first relies on the co-development of an intuitive and didactic formatting of an ESM toolbox to support the eco-ideation phase in multidisciplinary groups. Second, we propose a method in three main steps implemented in a four-hour workshop: a screening phase with the seven ESMs followed by an in-depth divergent phase with a single mechanism, and a convergent formalization of eco-innovative concepts. We illustrate the eco-innovation method by a real-world case study of an interior agency of a co-working building emphasizing circular economy principles and quality of life at work. A group of 13 stakeholders and experts (architects, eco-design experts, local authority and user representatives) were divided into three groups, facilitated by two researchers. The paper shows that this eco-ideation toolbox can be implemented in a real-life context of interior design in multidisciplinary groups involving multiple stakeholders. It supported the groups in sharing a common vision of interior design, and generating three original concepts of co-working spaces. Â© 2020 The Author(s).

It is expected that CSP, together with wind and solar photovoltaic, will constitute a stable, high percentage of renewable energy generation system that will be price-competitive with conventional energy sources. In this study, a dynamic programming approach based on minimum cost was used to explore the optimal development path of CSP generation in China by 2050. A learning curve model and a technology diffusion model were used as constraints. The impact of factors such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth, incentive policies, technological advances, grid absorptive capacity, and emission regulation schemes on the development of CSP generation was discussed in the context of sensitivity analysis and scenario comparison. This study has reached the following conclusions: 1) the government cannot achieve the target for cumulative installed capacity in 2050. Considering the interaction of relevant factors, the target would be hard to achieve even under favorable conditions; 2) as a key factor affecting the development of CSP, the incentive policy is closely related to construction cost. It is noteworthy that although the target can be achieved with a higher investment ratio, the CSP industry has failed to create a good ecological environment in the early stage of development; 3) GDP growth and learning rate are important factors influencing the development path in later stages; and 4) although they operate as potential factors affecting construction costs, grid absorptive capacity and carbon permit prices have limited impact on the development of CSP generation.

(2021),New product performance implications of ambidexterity in strategic marketing foci: a case of emerging market firms,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & INDUSTRIAL MARKETING,,10.1108/JBIM-01-2020-0003,"Purpose Ambidexterity's effects on exploration and exploitation have been widely studied in the innovation literature. However, to date, no studies have determined how combining or balancing the two strategic marketing foci may improve new product performance outcomes. This is an important issue in emerging markets, which have considerable potential to introduce new products, given the rising affordability and intense competition between Western and local firms. These challenges compel managers to offer new products and solutions in these markets. However, firms may adopt different strategic marketing foci for new product development. Using Pakistan as an emerging-market context, this paper aims to provide novel insights into how managers can choose the right balance of a customer-driving versus customer-driven strategy to optimise new-product performance. Design/methodology/approach A multi-industry approach surveyed senior strategy managers (N = 106) of Pakistani businesses. Findings Using polynomial regression and surface test analyses, the findings showed that balancing the two strategies influenced new-product performance more than either strategy alone. Surprisingly, the imbalance of greater customer-driving over customer-driven strategy or vice versa did not improve new-product performance. Moreover, new-product performance was greater when the level of balance was higher compared to when it was lower. Originality/value Grounded in behavioural and strategic adaptation theory, this study extends ambidexterity's theoretical foundations in marketing by empirically determining the optimal balance of an orientation and performance implication model. The findings can assist emerging market managers in choosing the right balance and combination of the two strategies for better performance of new products.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JBIM-01-2020-0003,WOS,Journal

It considers how Machine Learning (ML) can be used to help make the processes of Web Navigation more accessible in line with Web Content Accessibility Guideline (WCAG) 2.4 Navigable, which demands that ways be provided ""to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.""ML techniques such as reinforcement learning have been applied to website navigation in diverse ways. These include goal-directed search to answer questions and task-oriented problems such as booking a flight. Related work includes Web Automation and Testing. These techniques typically involve a state space exploration where actions such as clicking links, filling forms, and pressing buttons move the agent to a new state. The search space can be represented as a directed graph whose nodes represent the state. The choice of action involves a reward in reinforcement learning, which is used to learn behavior. Sequences of actions are collected into policies and the objective is to identify the best policy. For many websites, the potential search space is exceptionally large, and these techniques can provide ways of navigating them more efficiently. While the outcomes of these approaches can help to make the processes of search and task completion easier and thereby help accessibility, it is not the primary focus. The question under consideration is whether these techniques can be adapted to improve the website's navigability from an accessibility perspective. The approach seems promising. The state-space can be explored automatically, and the state representation can then be mined using ML techniques for structure, content and other information, which has the potential to improve accessibility Examples of the application of these approaches, which reflect the goals of the success criteria around WCAG Guideline 2.1 would include the generation of good anchor text for links where this is not provided, optimizing pathways to website functionality, and optimizing the processes of querying the website. There are open questions about how state representation can be enhanced to improve the prospects of reaching goal states. For example, can the process of calculating reward exploit features such as Search Engine Optimization information, which is designed to reflect the purpose of the page directly? Indexing techniques from Information science can serve a similar purpose. From an accessibility standpoint, there are exciting directions to explore. For example, what role can accessibility features, e.g., Headings, Anchor Text, and alternative text, play in calculating rewards. By way of illustration, a case study on one of these page enhancement techniques, DocTTTTTQuery, will be presented. This enhances a document by generating potential queries from its content. The system is trained by matching these generated questions against a set of historical questions asked of the site. This knowledge can then be exploited to lead the user more directly to potential answers to queries. Other studies have shown the effectiveness of this approach. Augmenting the page with these queries has shown improved search performance.

Research featuring investments in information technology (IT) and market-oriented IT (MOIT) competence to facilitate the flow of firm innovativeness (FI) across multisectoral start-ups is yet to be identified. Further, the role of innovation orientation (IO)-enabled firm innovativeness (FI) on sustainable competitive advantage (SCA) needs further exploration in the light of customer orientation (CO) of the enterprise. It is partially because the underlying mechanism remains largely unexplored in the context of rippling start-ups. In the current research, we conceptualized and tested a model that examines the role of MOIT competence and knowledge sharing mechanism (KSM) on FI and SCA, in the light of Resource Advantage (R-A) theory and SD logic (SDL) framework. This model also proposes and establishes IO as an important enabler for firm's competitive advantage.

While most TIS studies aim at deriving policy recommendations - typically by identifying system barriers - the actual role of these proposed policies in the TIS is rarely looked at. In addition, often single policy instruments instead of more encompassing policy mixes are considered. We address these shortcomings by applying a more comprehensive policy mix concept within the TIS approach. In doing so we analyze interdependencies between the policy mix and the TIS by shedding light on the role of the policy mix for TIS functioning and performance as well as how TIS developments influence the evolution of the policy mix. We explore these interdependencies for the case of offshore wind in Germany, using data from event history analysis and expert interviews. We find highly dynamic interdependencies with reoccurring patterns of systemic problems and adjustments of the policy mix, which are fuelled by high policy mix credibility and supportive actors. Our study constitutes a first step incorporating the policy mix concept into the TIS approach, thereby enabling a better understanding of real dynamics occurring in TIS.

Despite their intention to support long-term planning decisions, model uptake has generally been limited, partly due to their unfulfilled capability to manage deep uncertainty issues and consider multiple perspectives and trade-offs involved when solving problems of interest. In recent years, more emphasis has been put on the need for existing models to evolve to be used for exploratory modeling and analysis to capture and manage deep uncertainty. Building new models is a solution but may face challenges in terms of feasibility and the conservation of knowledge assets. Integration and augmentation of existing models is another solution, but little guidance exists on how to realize model augmentation that addresses deep uncertainty and how to use such models for exploratory modeling purposes. To provide guidance on how to augment existing models to support decisions under deep uncertainty we present an approach for identifying minimum information requirements (MIRs) that consists of three steps: (1) invoking a decision support framework [here, Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP)] to synthesize information requirements, (2) characterizing misalignment with an existing integrated model, (3) designing adjustable solutions that align model output with immediate information needs. We employ the Basin Futures model to set up the approach and illustrate outcomes in terms of its effectiveness to augment models for exploratory purposes, as well as its potential for supporting the design of adaptative pathways. The results are illustrated in the context of the Brahmani River Basin (BRB) system and discussed in terms of generalization and transferability of the approach to identifying MIRs.

In the recent years, the combined use of data mining techniques and statistical methods has shown promising results in discovering knowledge from large and complex datasets. In this chapter, we propose a methodology that utilizes hierarchical clustering along with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to generate informative data cubes at different levels of data abstraction. Moreover, automatically ranked cube navigational paths are provided by our proposed methods to enhance knowledge discovery from large data cubes.

(2021),Full-length ribosome density prediction by a multi-input and multi-output model,PLoS Computational Biology,,10.1371/JOURNAL.PCBI.1008842,"Translation elongation is regulated by a series of complicated mechanisms in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Although recent advance in ribosome profiling techniques has enabled one to capture the genome-wide ribosome footprints along transcripts at codon resolution, the regulatory codes of elongation dynamics are still not fully understood. Most of the existing computational approaches for modeling translation elongation from ribosome profiling data mainly focus on local contextual patterns, while ignoring the continuity of the elongation process and relations between ribosome densities of remote codons. Modeling the translation elongation process in full-length coding sequence (CDS) level has not been studied to the best of our knowledge. In this paper, we developed a deep learning based approach with a multi-input and multi-output framework, named RiboMIMO, for modeling the ribosome density distributions of full-length mRNA CDS regions. Through considering the underlying correlations in translation efficiency among neighboring and remote codons and extracting hidden features from the input full-length coding sequence, RiboMIMO can greatly outperform the state-of-the-art baseline approaches and accurately predict the ribosome density distributions along the whole mRNA CDS regions. In addition, RiboMIMO explores the contributions of individual input codons to the predictions of output ribosome densities, which thus can help reveal important biological factors influencing the translation elongation process. The analyses, based on our interpretable metric named codon impact score, not only identified several patterns consistent with the previously-published literatures, but also for the first time (to the best of our knowledge) revealed that the codons located at a long distance from the ribosomal A site may also have an association on the translation elongation rate. This finding of long-range impact on translation elongation velocity may shed new light on the regulatory mechanisms of protein synthesis. Overall, these results indicated that RiboMIMO can provide a useful tool for studying the regulation of translation elongation in the range of full-length CDS. Copyright: Â© 2021 Tian et al.

Design/methodology/approach This paper first reviewed the literature on the structure and coordinating mechanism of enterprise innovation ecosystem and identified two important gaps on the characteristics of ecosystem actors and the logic of innovative coordination. Then, the paper adopted grounded analysis about the construction and evolution of Haier's innovation ecosystem based on longitudinal case data. On the basis of the case study, the construct of firm-level innovation ecosystem and new logic of coordination are formed. Findings This paper found the emerging phenomenon of sub-organizational ecosystem actors and depicted that the establishing process of firm-level innovation ecosystem went through three majors stages, and the corresponding coordinating logic changed from proactive intervention to reactive self-evolution. Originality/value This paper tried to make contributions to the studies of structure and coordinating mechanism of enterprise innovation ecosystem, and proposed the enterprise itself could build firm-level ecosystem within its organizational boundary and interact with external ecosystem. The findings enlightened the nested structure of ecosystem, opened the black box of organizational boundary and broke the limitation that existing researches only analyse innovation ecosystem at system level and regard firms as basic analytical unit. Besides, this paper proposed that the coordination of innovation ecosystem can be passively fulfilled by network effect and ecological evolution, where previous studies mainly focused on proactive institutional intervention and resource investment.

The purpose of this study is to understand how reverse innovation has successfully diffused into the product and market development strategies at Philips Inc., a prominent multinational company (MNC) of the modern era. Furthermore, the study presents the success achieved by these innovations at both the domestic and global levels, along with their implications regarding socio-economic sustainability in emerging markets. In order to investigate the research questions, a case study of Philips China was conducted involving three product innovations that were found to be suitable examples of reverse innovation. After the study of extant literature on the topic, drawing from research databases, newspaper articles, and company press releases, five semi-structuredinterviews were conducted with key managers and a market practitioner to gain sufficient understanding for this exploratory study. Subsequent case analysis concludes that these innovations are examples of reverse innovation representing a new paradigm change in innovation flow. This flow of innovation from emerging markets to developed markets as confirmed by Corsi's framework could potentially disrupt developed markets as well as contribute to ensure healthy living conditions for the population living in developing countries. If so, this represents a sustainable socio-economic change in-line with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of ""ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages.""

However, building a strong green brand to foster consumers' satisfaction is often challenging for firms. Drawing on the dynamic capability and mechanism-enabling perspectives of ambidexterity. The purpose of this research is to explore mechanisms of perceived brand performance and green trust through which green brand ambidexterity acts as a facilitator of consumer satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach The hypothesized relationships were tested by both partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM; symmetric approach) and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA; asymmetric approach) with data collected from a green consumer questionnaire survey in Hong Kong. Findings The results from PLS-SEM indicate that green brand ambidexterity affects consumer satisfaction through multiple mediating paths of perceived brand performance, green trust-consumer and the sequential integration of perceived brand performance and green trust. Results from fsQCA further reinforced these findings. Research limitations/implications The present research provides a nuanced understanding of how ambidexterity enhances consumer satisfaction in the context of a green brand by identifying multiple mechanisms. Originality/value There is a lack of research on how green brand ambidexterity affects green brand outcomes from the perspective of value creation for consumers. The present research fills this gap by providing more comprehensive explanations of mechanisms for green brand ambidexterity to facilitate consumer satisfaction. It also offers a better understanding of how the effects of green brand ambidexterity are viewed on a path-dependency that is aligned with the dynamic capability perspective of ambidexterity and how green trust forms a critical path to enable green brand ambidexterity and perceived brand performance to enhance consumer satisfaction.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JCM-02-2021-4483,WOS,Journal

Thus, the researchers or the organizations are able to collect large amount of information via the feedback of the crowd in a short time with a low cost. Despite the wide adoption of crowdsourcing, several of its fundamental problems remain unsolved especially at the information and cognitive levels with respect to incentive design, information aggregation, and heterogeneous learning. This tutorial aims to: (1) provide a comprehensive review of recent advances in exploring the power of crowdsourcing from the perspective of optimizing the wisdom of the crowd; and (2) identify the open challenges and provide insights to the future trends in the context of human-in-the-loop learning. We believe this is an emerging and potentially high-impact topic in computational data science, which will attract both researchers and practitioners from academia and industry.

Evidence derived, mostly from high-income countries, shows how it gradually impacts the personal and household financial condition causing the increased psychosocial burden of the patient and their families (termed 'financial toxicity'). Aim: To qualitatively explore the financial toxicities in patients with advanced head and neck malignancies in India, and to consider how it impacts the patient and his family. Methods: Interviewing a purposive sample of 8 patients using semi-structured interviews face to face. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, and a thematic content analysis was carried out. Results: Four major themes were identified: burden and amplifying factors, impact, rescue and relieving factors, and learning and innovation. The burden of cost relates to diagnosis, treatment and non-medical costs which gets amplified while navigating the healthcare labyrinth. Emerging themes describe financial journey of cancer patients, the issues faced by them and the ways they tackle these issues during their treatment. Healthcare system factors like limited availability of adequate/comprehensive/meaningful insurance and reimbursements potentiate the toxicity. The financial toxicity leads to a significant adverse financial, psychological and social impact on the patient and the family. While moving through the process of care, there were a few learnings and innovations which patients proposed. Conclusion: This study provides qualitative evidence of the considerable and pervasive nature of financial toxicity in head and neck cancer patients in India. The findings have implications for all cancer patients and highlight the unmet need of psychosocial support for these patients. Â© 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

Methods/Statistical analysis: Methods/Statistical analysis: Excel and CatBoost algorithms were used for preprocessing and analysis of the collected data. 21,140 pieces of valid data consisting of 27 attributes were obtained, and they were classified into a training set and a test set necessary for the development and use of machine learning-based predictive models. The training set was used as input data to develop the predictive models, and the test set was used as input data to evaluate the performance of the developed models. A decision tree analysis algorithm was applied, and performance analysis was performed by using accuracy, precision, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area as indicators. Findings: First, the predictive models developed for three diseases, i.e., diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, were found to have a prediction accuracy exceeding 80 to 90% and a large AUC. Second, the collected data was useful in predictive modeling research, based on a cluster analysis of the data of patients who tested positive for metabolic syndromes (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia) and the data of patients who tested negative. Third, from the above study results, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension were found to be adult diseases, with a high level of association with blood circulation, and it was determined that it would be possible to predict cases in which a single person had multiple diseases at the same time. Fourth, it was deemed that it would be possible to obtain useful results by changing the data structure into a form of test result data for time series analysis and data with a display of disease diagnosis time point. Improvements/Applications: Through the development of predictive models for diseases using machine learning technology, predictive modeling is expected to evolve to enable prediction of diverse diseases, thereby improving the clinical environment and enhancing the reliability and competitiveness of medical care by preventing potential diagnostic errors.

Using a multiscale institutional approach, we explore rules, property rights, and stakeholdersâ€™ values and the extent to which such institutions may entail or prevent governance innovations around ES. We focus on water supply and a Southern municipality of Chile as an apt illustration. Results show that the concept of ES and ES mechanisms are exempt from formal norms (e.g., national laws). The formal institutional setting is generally weak with respect to nature conservation and a fragmented view prevails, where the management of land, water, forests and protected areas is separately handled by a myriad of agencies. The presence of highly concentrated water rights may impair benefits appropriability by ES beneficiaries, as long as any potential buyer can acquire water rights. Furthermore, incompatible values regarding nature create tensions across different stakeholders, particularly between hydroelectricity companies and indigenous communities. In this scenario of multiple rationalities, moving towards ES-based environmental governance seems problematic. In light of the evidence, it is clear that the ES approach does not necessarily fit in every local reality and seems to face obstacles, such as achieving equity and justice, particularly in contexts wherein local and indigenous knowledge systems have not been adequately considered by states within their institutional arrangements.

The complexity is related to the significant number of possible conformations a single protein can assume. Metaheuristics became useful algorithms to find feasible solutions in viable computational time since exact algorithms are not capable. However, these stochastic methods are highly-dependent from parameter tuning for finding the balance between exploitation (local search refinement) and exploration (global exploratory search) capabilities. Thus, self-adaptive techniques were created to handle the parameter definition task, since it is time-consuming. In this paper, we enhance the Self-Adaptive Differential Evolution with problem-domain knowledge provided by the angle probability list approach, comparing it with every single mutation we used to compose our set of mutation operators. Moreover, a population diversity metric is used to analyze the behavior of each one of them. The proposed method was tested with ten protein sequences with different folding patterns. Results obtained showed that the self-adaptive mechanism has a better balance between the search capabilities, providing better results in regarding root mean square deviation and potential energy than the non-adaptive single-mutation methods.

To achieve the high transparency and security assurance of deep learning models, the interpretability research of deep neural networks is of great theoretical significance and industrial application value and recently gains increasingly attention. However, because of the intrinsic black-box characteristics of the deep learning models, the interpretation of its internal structure and the running mechanism is still of great challenges, including the rigorous theoretical results originated from the manual observations of large-scale training and testing set, and scarce appropriate explanation of the learning results based on the human understanding. Moreover, most of the existing researches analyzing the decision-making process of deep learning models only from a local perspective and lacks a graphical representation based on the overall understanding. On the other hand, the interpretable basis decomposition (IBD) model has the advantages that its interpretation result is not only a strict corresponding relation from scene to feature, but also is a kind of semi-structured data which can facilitate IBD based knowledge map construction from it. Aiming at the problem that existing deep neural network visualization researches lacks the interpretability based on the knowledge map and the well-suited knowledge map representability of IBD, we propose a deep neural network visualization approach based on interpretable basis decomposition and knowledge map, which fully takes the advantage of map construction ability of interpretable basis decomposition. Firstly, we propose a knowledge map construction method based on the feature decomposition structure of IBD, which constructs the map information, such as the interpretation relationship and juxtaposition relationship, between the scene and the interpretable feature. Then, a similarity clustering algorithm between scenes using Jaccard coefficient based on the interpretation relation network of scenes and features is proposed. Based on a scene discriminant feature extraction method, the decomposed features that can distinguish this class from other classes are extracted from each type of sample, namely discriminant features. Meanwhile, we quantify the accuracy of discriminant feature extraction by means of manual evaluation by exploring the difference between different models' understanding of the recognition target and that of human beings. Furthermore, a fidelity test method for deep network has been proposed to solve the problem that existing research lacks fidelity test. We combine the multi-feature thermal spectrograms into a comprehensive characteristic thermal spectrogram, and then use the Hadmag product to refuse the comprehensive characteristic thermal spectrogram with the original image to obtain the characteristic fusion spectrogram. The luminance labeled depth neural network classification model of feature fusion map was used to identify the target location pixel area, and the target location ability of thermal spectrum map was measured by comparing the deviation of input original map and feature fusion map to the model classification ability, so as to obtain the fidelity of the interpretable basis decomposition model. Both the fidelity test and the human confidence test show that the proposed method can achieve excellent results. Â© 2021, Science Press.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework to improve the segmentation accuracy on spine images via structure-enhanced attentive learning. Since the spine bones contain strong prior knowledge of their shapes and positions in ultrasound VPI images, we propose to encode this information into the semantic representations in an attentive manner. We first revisit the self-attention mechanism in representation learning, and then present a strategy to introduce the structural knowledge into the key representation in self-attention. By this means, the network explores both the contextual and structural information in the learned features, and consequently improves the segmentation accuracy. We conduct various experiments to demonstrate that our proposed method achieves promising performance on spine image segmentation, which shows great potential in clinical diagnosis.

The main aim is to understand the active role of volunteers in internal branding that is in the co-creation of value. A subsidiary aim is to understand why some volunteers engage deeply and seriously in a nonprofit organization while other volunteers seem less connected? Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual framework incorporates several motivators to volunteer-led co-creation. A quantitative, co-variance-based structural equation modelling approach is used on survey data of a sample of 357 volunteers from 14 organizations in the Australian nonprofit sector. Findings: The research findings contribute to the newly emerging internal branding literature focusing on the active co-creation role of internal stakeholders. The main drivers of volunteer co-creation are volunteer engagement, commitment, altruism, values-congruency and brand reputation. Different explanatory mechanisms/motivators apply to each type of volunteer-led co-creation. In a major initiative, the paper demonstrates linkages across the different types of co-creation, with a foundation/pivotal role for one particular type of co-creation, namely, enhanced client-based solutions. Research limitations/implications: The research is restricted to the public sector and further research is needed to test applicability to the private sector. Future studies could continue the initiative in the current study to explore the linkages across co-creation types. Practical implications: Implications depend on which type of co-creation is targeted. Enhancing client-based solutions co-creation requires a very strong role for engaged volunteers. Innovation co-creation requires both engaged volunteers and a propensity to co-create by enhancing client-based solutions. Brand advocacy co-creation is driven by volunteer commitment, altruism and a propensity to co-create innovation. Social implications: A non-profit context ensures major social implications. Originality/value: The study operationalizes the Saleem and Iglesias (2016) new internal branding paradigm framework by demonstrating that brands are built organically by interacting and engaging with internal stakeholders (volunteers in this instance), which, in turn, inter alia, motivates co-creation by such internal stakeholders.

One of these approaches is to leverage the value of emerging information technologies such as Building Information Modelling (BIM) in architectural design. Leveraging these potentials requires promoting an appropriate context for the implementation and adoption of these new technologies. In response to the turbulent and multifaceted socio-technical nature of modern information technologies and the environmental uncertainty, architects enhance enablers to advance the architectural design process. Enablers are the preeminent factors that facilitate the implementation of new technologies and contribute to the sustainable development of projects and organizations. Given the lack of dedicated studies on the enablers affecting BIM application, this study aims to identify and classify these enablers in the architectural design phase. Following a systematic literature review approach, a comprehensive list of enablers for BIM application in the architectural design phase was identified. The prepared survey questionnaire was distributed to 205 construction experts (i.e. project managers, employers, consultants, and contractors). The collected data were analyzed with the Robust Exploratory Factor Analysis method, ended up with classifying 36 enablers into four main categories: human skills, environmental, technological, and organizational factors. The findings of this study, considering the organizational enablers, recommend that the support of government officials to implement a particular validation process for BIM adoption is crucial. The contribution of this research lies in identifying and classifying enablers for BIM application in the architectural design phase, with the potentials to be applied in real work practices to improve BIM capabilities and enhance BIM initiatives in construction projects.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15623599.2021.1985775,WOS,Journal

While the major market players have recognized the importance of personalizing health care as the next milestone towards improved clinical outcomes, a common framework has yet to emerge. In the absence of such governance framework, the practices of research and development can shape the progress of the field. The cognitive structure of the research and development in the personalized medicine is mapped by characterizing the attributes of underlying technological space. Methods: By exploring the technological trajectory and emerging patterns of personalized medicine discerned in patenting activity and citation relations, a detailed picture of innovation in the field is obtained. Moreover, a topic modeling technique was applied to understand the emergence and institutionalization of new technological fields. Results: The results show that the patent landscape is dominated by therapeutic patents used in the oncology and therapeutic areas of neurodegenerative and infectious diseases. Increase in funding for the proper cycling between research, clinical care, and cost management program would accelerate the adoption of precision medicine and promote the convergence of IT-driven data science and the traditional natural sciences. Conclusions: This work offers a complementary perspective to the field of personalized medicine, focusing on the exploitation of patent information. We expect that systematic understanding of the technology landscape and evolving R&D process in the personalized medicine may help to provide insights for making future technology planning more rationally.

On the other hand, many applications of machine learning involve the interpretation of local circumstances from experience gained over many observations; that is, machine learning potentially provides an ideal solution for more efficient microscopy. This paper explores the potential for informing the microscope's observation strategy while characterising critical events. In particular, the identification of regions likely to experience twin activity (twin interaction with grain boundary) in AZ31 magnesium is attempted, from only local information. EBSD-based observations in the neighbourhoods of twin activity are fed into a machine-learning environment to inform the future search for such events, and the accuracy of the resultant decisions is quantified relative to the number of prior observations. The potential for utilising different types of local information, and their resultant value in the prediction process, is also assessed. After applying an attribute selection filter, and various other machine-learning tools, a decision-tree model is able to classify likely neighbourhoods of twin activity with 85% accuracy. The resultant framework provides the first step towards an intelligent microscopy for efficient observation of stochastic events during in situ microscopy campaigns. Lay descriptionOne role of artificial intelligence is to predict future events after learning from many previous observations. In materials science, various phenomena (such as crack nucleation) are difficult to predict because they have been insufficiently observed. Furthermore, observation is difficult, precisely because their location cannot be predicted, leading to a chicken and egg conundrum. This paper applies machine learning to the search for twin nucleation sites in a magnesium alloy, in an attempt to guide the observation of twin nucleation events in a microscope based on previous observations. As more data is obtained, the accuracy of the location prediction will increase. In the current case, the machine-learning tool achieved 85% accuracy for predicting the location of twin interactions with grain boundaries after several thousand observations. The resultant framework provides the first step towards an intelligent microscopy for efficient observation of stochastic events during in situ microscopy campaigns.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jmi.12748,WOS,Journal

However, despite the rapidly expanding evidence base demonstrating the efficacy of eMental Health care, its implementation in clinical practice and health care systems remains fragmented. To date, no peer-reviewed, key-informant studies have reported on the perspectives of decision-makers concerned with whether and how to implement eMental Health care. Methods: From September to November 2015, we conducted 31 interviews with key informants responsible for leadership, policy, research, and/ or information technology in organizations influential in the adoption of technology for eMental Health care. Deductive and inductive thematic analyses of transcripts were conducted using the Behavior Change Wheel as an organizing framework. Frequency and intensity effect sizes were calculated for emerging themes to further explore patterns within the data. Results: Key informant responses (n = 31) representing 6 developed countries and multiple organizations showed consensus on common factors impacting implementation: individual and organizational capacities (e.g., computer literacy skills [patients and providers], knowledge gaps about cyber security, limited knowledge of available services); motivational drivers of technology-based care (e.g., extending care, data analytics); and opportunities for health systems to advance eMental Health care implementation (e.g., intersectoral research, rapid testing cycles, sustainable funding). Frequency effect sizes showed strong associations between implementation and credibility, knowledge, workflow, patient empowerment, electronic medical record (EMR) integration, sustained funding and intersectoral networks. Intensity effect sizes showed the highest concentration of statements (>10% of all comments) related to funding, credibility, knowledge gaps, and patient empowerment. Conclusion: This study provides previously unavailable information about key informant perspectives on eMental Health care implementation. The themes that emerged, namely the need to intensify intersectoral research, measure/monitor readiness to implement, define cost-utility benchmarks, raise awareness about available technologies, and test assumptions that â€˜provenâ€™ technologies will be easily integrated can inform the design and evaluation of eMental Health care implementation models.

Design/methodology/approach This study engages in an extensive scale development effort to collect representative data about the NBS in the Pakistani setting, complemented by relevant validity and reliability tests. The overall theoretical model was tested on 214 firms by means of a structural equation modeling approach, using partial least-squares algorithms. Findings The results statistically supported the role of firm-level knowledge repositories (intellectual capital) and knowledge exploration and exploitation capabilities (absorptive capacity) as sequential mediators in the association of NBS and firm-level innovation. Besides, bridging networks of lateral ties among Pakistani businesses are found to be more effective than bonding networks of vertical ties in encouraging radical innovations. Originality/value This study significantly extends the literature about the NBS approach. It provides specific sense-making mechanisms (i.e. priming, triggering and editing) about how abstract institutional templates constituted at the business system level are translated into firm-level actionable sets by the help of intangible resource repositories and processes that guide knowledge exploration and exploitation.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EJIM-01-2019-0016,WOS,Journal

Since executive mangers around the world work with management systems (MSs) to guide and improve organizational operations, this work aims to explore how integrated MSs (IMS) as business tools can contribute to the adoption of CE principles at the corporate level. To achieve this objective, a systematic literature review is performed, which results in a synthesis sample of 18 academic papers. The findings reveal how MSs contribute to CE adoption and, therefore, demonstrate that managers can use IMS to foster CE implementation. In addition, the findings highlight the importance of institutional intervention in the transition from a linear towards a circular designed economy. The paper contributes to academia by linking the concepts of IMS and CE, synthesizing the current academic knowledge at hand, and proposing a comprehensive research agenda that sets the path for future academic investigations. In a practical perspective, the paper contributes also to managers since it emphasizes how IMS can be used to incorporate circular business thinking into operations management.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.12924/cis2022.10020001,WOS,Journal

However, these tools often guarantee only basic knowledge transmission, but do not foster the acquisition of practical competencies. These limits may depend on an outdated design vision, not bound to neurosciences principles. Moreover, these learning objects still have many shortcomings related to the following elements: 1) linear sequences of descriptive screens, without significant interactions; 2) no modular structures which do not allow students any personalization; 3) large amount of redundant information; 4) restricted training time that prevent an effective management of study time; 5) formal evaluation activities that are focused only on basic knowledge; 6) no adaptability to the different needs of the job profiles. In this paper we introduce a design model that solves these issues, thanks to an integration of the neurosciences principles, and a new methodology for the multi-layered design of learning objects for practical competencies' acquisition, according to business goals. The model proposes to map working processes and job profiles to identify the different levels of needed knowledge/competencies through a matrix. At each level it suggests the methods for content delivery (1. Explore, 2. Learn, 3. Practice, 4. Solve) according to the corresponding learning objectives and to Multimedia Learning and Presentation Design principles. In this way, it creates the different smart blocks of a training path according to a multi- layered logic, that allows to customize the course delivery, according to the training needs of each job profile and to the time available for the study.",2018,,WOS,Conference Paper

Drawing from a large-scale action research study involving a complex collaborative organizational construct, we outline three challenges from employing action research: the process is both reflexive and progressive, the researcher is both an outsider and an insider, and the outcome is both general and specific. A model of three social spaces (the action research space, the academic space, and the practitioner space) is proposed to address the challenges and assist in navigating the multitude of processes, roles, and outcomes associated with action research. The study argues that action research for IM is well suited to exploring tacit aspects of practices and processes in the emergent or shifting study contexts to transform practices through interventions. Thus, if implemented carefully by experienced researchers, it can provide valuable data that are indispensable for theory development in the field of IM. Â© 2020 The Authors.

Based on the survey data of low-carbon pilot cities, this paper finds that nested structure has a positive impact on policy innovation and discusses the impact on policy innovation from three dimensions: the nested pilot, the nested policy and the nested department. Heckman selection Model and Possion Model are used to make an empirical analysis of the factors influencing policy innovation and used a case study to explore the mechanism. The results show that the nested structure has a positive effect on policy innovation in pilot projects of low-carbon cities with weak incentives and weak constraints. Specifically, the participation of local governments in low-carbon related pilot projects, the number of low-carbon policies introduced by local governments, and the participation of local government departments in the process of low-carbon governance have a positive impact on policy innovation.

Design/methodology/approach A critical and thematic analysis conducted on 115 scientific papers reveals a noticeable growth in adopting digital technologies to leverage a CE system. Moreover, a conceptual framework is developed to show the interrelationship between different I4.0 technologies to foster the implantation of CE in the construction industry. Findings Most of the existing bodies of research provide conceptual solutions rather than developing workable applications and the future of smart cities. Moreover, the coalescence of different technologies is highly recommended to enable tracking of building assets' and components' (e.g. fixtures and fittings and structural components) performance, which enables users to optimize the salvage value of components reusing or recycling them just in time and extending assets' operating lifetime. Finally, circular supply chain management must be adopted for both new and existing buildings to realise the industry's CE ambitions. Hence, further applied research is required to foster CE adoption for existing cities and infrastructure that connects them.

Recently, inspired by the specialized functions of two cerebral hemispheres in processing low and high spatial frequency information, some dual-path neural networks with global and local branches have been proposed to deal with both coarse- and fine-grained visual tasks simultaneously. However, in existing works, the interhemispheric communication mechanism, which is responded by the corpus callosum, the largest white matter structure in the human brain that connecting the left and right cerebral hemispheres, is still not fully explored and exploited. This paper aims to explore how the corpus callosum can inspire us to enable transfer and integration of information between global and local branches in hemisphere-inspired artificial neural networks, such that one branch can leverage the other's learned knowledge and benefit each other. To this end, we propose a gated intercommunication unit to selectively transfer useful knowledge between the two branches via attention mechanisms to alleviate the negative transfer.

This study holds the view that CoPS catch-up means a narrower gap in the innovation ecosystem between latecomers and leaders. This study disentangles the CoPS innovation ecosystem and uses Chinaâ€™s high-speed railway (HSR) as a longitudinal case with abundant data to explore how successful catch-up in CoPS is achieved. The results show that the CoPS innovation ecosystem presents a dynamic evolution in the technology innovation subsystem, the value creation subsystem, and the habitat. Four types of forces from the innovation ecosystem mix together to drive CoPS catch-up. Finally, this study proposes a CoPS catch-up process model following the basic logic of start point, activities, and performance, and CoPS industrial standards are used to measure CoPS catch-up performance. The study on CoPS catch-up from an innovation ecosystem perspective provides new insights and useful implications for governments and entities in CoPS of emerging economies. Â© 2022 by the authors.

This article uses ERGMs (exponential random graph models) to synthesize user attributes from the perspective of social networks, social support and social capital to systematically explore the mechanism of knowledge diffusion in the MOOC learning forum. Design/methodology/approach: First, the literature related to knowledge diffusion is reviewed to define two forms of knowledge diffusion in the MOOC learning forum, i.e., knowledge transferring and knowledge sharing. Second, based on social network theory, research hypotheses related to centrality, reciprocity, and transitivity are proposed; based on social support theory, research hypotheses related to emotional support, information support and sense of belonging support are proposed; and based on social capital theory, research hypotheses related to the number of posts and number of being liked are proposed. Third, machine learning, the most popular course on the Coursera platform, is selected as the research object. The data from March 2016 to December 2019 is obtained, and then, ERGMs are used to simulate the network and test the research hypotheses. Finally, based on the conclusions of this study, corresponding suggestions are proposed from the perspectives of MOOCs platform providers, MOOCs providers and MOOCs learners, to promote the development of MOOCs. Findings: - (1) In the MOOC learning forum, users with high degree centrality contribute more, actively answering questions from other users, and transferring knowledge to others, but knowledge sharing between two users with high degree centrality is unlikely to occur. (2) Significant reciprocity features exist in knowledge transfer in the MOOC learning forum. (3) There is no significant triangular relationship structure in the knowledge sharing network of the MOOC learning forum, which means that multiple dyad sharing partners are more likely to be formed in the MOOC learning forum. (4) Users with emotion tendency tend to transfer knowledge to other users, and knowledge sharing is likely to occur between individuals with emotion tendency. (5) There is no tendency that users with low learning progress receive knowledge transferred by other users. (6) Teaching assistants, as users with higher knowledge potential in the MOOC learning forum, are prone to transfer knowledge to other users. (7) The trend of knowledge sharing between users in the same region is not obvious. (8) Users with more posts and users with more being liked are more likely to receive knowledge transfer by the other users, and thus, they are easier to obtain answers from. A possible explanation for this result could be that users with more posts and users with more being liked have a higher contribution to the MOOC learning forum, and therefore, questions they raised are more likely to attract attention. Theoretical implications: First, current research on the MOOC learning forum focuses on the discussion of user behavior, but there is a lack of research on knowledge diffusion. Therefore, in terms of the research perspective, from the aspect of knowledge diffusion, this article defines two forms of knowledge diffusion: knowledge transfer and knowledge sharing. Then, knowledge transfer network and knowledge sharing network are constructed to explore user posting and replying behaviors, to expand the user behavior research in the MOOC learning forum. Second, current research on the user interaction network in the MOOC learning forum lacks comprehensive research on the network structure and user attributes. The micro logic embedded in the network structure must be systematically analyzed. Therefore, the network structure and user attributes are synthesized to explore the influencing factor of knowledge diffusion, which enriches the research content of the MOOC learning forum. Third, ERGMs are suitable for exploring potential factors of network formation, as well as the impact of multiple features simultaneously on network formation. Currently, ERGMs are widely used to research citation network formation mechanisms and social media network formation mechanisms. However, there is still a lack of research on user interaction networks in the MOOC learning forum while applying ERGMs. Therefore, this article introduces ERGMs into the knowledge diffusion research in the MOOC learning forum to provide effective research methods for modeling and simulating the knowledge diffusion networks. Practical implications: (1) Since high degree centrality users actively answer questions from others, MOOCs platform providers can encourage high degree centrality users to participate in in-depth discussion in forums. Based on the reciprocity of knowledge transfer, MOOCs platform providers can add an information reminder function to remind users to receive information in real time, to promote knowledge transfer between users. Because of the unstable knowledge sharing relationship among learners in the knowledge sharing network of the MOOC learning forum, it is not easy to form a triangular relationship structure. MOOCs platform providers can add a function such as friend circles to enhance the stability of the knowledge sharing relationship and improve the efficiency of the knowledge exchange. (2) Since teaching assistants actively answer questions from other users and play a prominent role in knowledge transfer, course providers can set appropriate incentives for teaching assistants. Because users with emotional tendency are more likely to transfer knowledge, and knowledge sharing is likely to occur between users with emotion tendency, course providers can properly guide users to engage in emotion communication through the participation of teaching assistants, to promote knowledge sharing among users. Because users with low learning progress are usually in a low potential knowledge position, course providers should pay attention to such users to improve their learning interests with help from users in a high potential knowledge position, such as teaching assistants or users who have high learning progress. (3) Because questions raised by users who have more being liked and more posts are more likely to be answered as a result of accumulating social capital, MOOCs learners should actively participate in the course learning forum and have effective interactions with other users. With the increasing number of being liked and the increasing number of posts, users gradually accumulate more social capital to build a foundation for improving their own learning effect. Originality/value: - First, at present, there are few studies on the mechanism of knowledge diffusion in the MOOC learning forum, and knowledge diffusion research is conducive to exploring the influencing factors of users' learning activities in the course learning forum. Therefore, this paper studies the influence mechanism of knowledge diffusion in the MOOC learning forum by integrating the network structure and user attributes to expand the knowledge diffusion research on the MOOC learning forum. Second, although SNA has been widely used in knowledge diffusion research, it is difficult for SNA to explore the potential factors for the formation of knowledge diffusion networks. ERGMs are based on relational data and use network local features as statistical items to explore the overall structural characteristics of the network. Therefore, this paper simulates knowledge diffusion networks of the MOOC learning forum based on ERGMs, systematically exploring the influence of the network structure and node attributes and their interaction with knowledge diffusion, which helps to reveal the socialization process and internal mechanism of the knowledge diffusion network.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2021.104295,WOS,Journal

Online communities form the basis for civic platforms, which are incubators for new ideas through peer-to-peer networks, stakeholder mobilization and collaborative and partnership engagement. Digital data analytics offers unprecedented opportunities to build capacity within communities simply because online platforms serve as acquisition hubs of structured and unstructured data. Notwithstanding, technology powered forms of engagement face multiple design and management challenges. Currently, limited research is being conducted into the online community using digital data analytics in non-business contexts. This explorative study further develops existing knowledge on civic tech communities and the use of digital data analytics. To this end, we review the previous research in order to understand how to aggregate literature on online communities, civic technologies and data analytics into a conceptual model that is useable by both academics and practitioners. The framework proposed serves as the first step in differentiating the building blocks of relevant digital data in managing civic technology communities and should be regarded as an effort to structure the available sources. Thus, the focus of the proposed conceptual model is not to offer prescriptive guidelines on the use of digital analytics, but rather to present a broader understanding of the emerging phenomenon and dimensions of data analysis.

Blockchain technology is a new application mode of computer technology such as distributed data storage, peer-to-peer transmission, consensus mechanism, encryption algorithm, and other computer technologies. It has the characteristics of decentralization, nontampering, transparent and open, and data traceability. The function of nontampering, hash function, and time stamp can effectively solve the traceability problem of TCM supply chain.

Extensive evaluation of chemical products for potential adverse effects is a challenging task, due to the large number of chemicals and the possible hazardous effects on human health. Safety regulatory agencies around the world are dealing with two major challenges. First, the growth of chemicals introduced every year in household products and medicines that need to be tested, and second the need to protect public welfare. Hence, alternative and more efficient toxicological risk assessment methods are in high demand. The Toxicology in the 21st Century (Tox21) consortium a collaborative effort was formed to develop and investigate alternative assessment methods. A collection of 10,000 compounds composed of environmental chemicals and approved drugs were screened for interference in biochemical pathways and released for crowdsourcing data analysis. The physicochemical space covered by Tox21 library was explored, measured by Molecular Weight (MW) and the octanol/water partition coefficient (cLogP). It was found that on average chemical structures had MW of 272.6 Daltons. In case of cLogP the average value was 2.476. Next relationships between assays were examined based on compounds activity profiles across the assays utilizing the Pearson correlation coefficient r. A cluster was observed between the Androgen and Estrogen Receptors and their ligand bind domains accordingly indicating presence of cross talks among the receptors. The highest correlations observed were between NR.AR and NR.AR_LBD, where it was r = 0.66 and between NR.ER and NR.ER_LBD, where it was r = 0.5. Our approach to model the Tox21 data consisted of utilizing circular molecular fingerprints combined with Random Forest and Support Vector Machine by modeling each assay independently. In all of the 12 sub-challenges our modeling approach achieved performance equal to or higher than 0.7 ROC-AUC showing strong overall performance. Best performance was achieved in sub-challenges NR.AR_LBD, NR.ER_LDB and NR.PPAR_gamma, where ROC-AUC of 0.756, 0.790, and 0.803 was achieved accordingly. These results show that computational methods based on machine learning techniques are well suited to support and play critical role in toxicological research.

The purpose of this qualitative study, conducted with transnational Latinx youth, was to identify the engineering-related skills and bodies of knowledge they developed and applied while in different workplaces. This study is framed in complementary theories of funds of knowledge, Vygotskian theories of mediated action, and theories of resistant capital. Specifically, this study is based in the premise that youth can develop engineering-related funds of knowledge through tool-mediated, goal-directed activities jointly conducted with family members and others, and that workplaces can be important sites for the development of funds of knowledge. Workplace activities are situated within sociohistorical contexts in which Latinx workers are often exploited and thus mobilize forms of resistance. A multiple case study was conducted with 20 transnational Latinx youth who currently or previously worked one or more jobs to supplement family income. Data sources included workplace observations, occupational interviews, and semi-structured interviews. We first divided the data by category of business ownership (family-owned businesses versus corporate-owned businesses) to explore whether different types of workplaces, characterized by different hierarchical relations, fostered different types of skills and bodies of knowledge. Constant comparative analytic methods were used to describe the engineering-related bodies of knowledge and skills, including critical resistant skills, that the youths applied in the context of workplace activities. Across different occupations, all youth developed and applied knowledge and skills related to industrial and operations engineering, including the iterative development of processes designed to maximize efficiency and to promote health and safety. While applying funds of knowledge toward their employersâ€™ goals, they also applied these funds of knowledge to make counter-spaces that were more humane, and they expanded technical processes to include a deep consideration of the emotions and well-being of people and animals. Ultimately, the youth mobilized and hoped to mobilize these funds of knowledge and forms of resistance toward more humane workplaces, better living conditions in their homes and communities, and more economically secure futures for themselves and their families. This study does not romanticize exploitative economic conditions experienced by suggesting that Latinx youthsâ€™ workplace experiences are positive, but it offers better understandings of the wide range of complex and rich engineering-related funds of knowledge developed in the context of different workplace activities. Educators who understand and recognize these funds of knowledge as assets may be able to design more equitable learning environments that position working youth as experts and core contributors. Educational implications include recognizing youthsâ€™ workplace experiences as epistemological resources, and critiquing and transforming systems through expanded visions of engineering. These visions of engineering can include but extend beyond the design of physical technologies, to encompass the design of interacting processes, technologies, and systems. Ultimately this type of education could repurpose workplace-derived funds of knowledge (from serving employers or corporations) toward more equitable futures (serving youthsâ€™ personal trajectories and communities).

These graphs, i.e. biological knowledge graphs, are then processed using graph exploratory approaches to perform different types of analytical and predictive tasks. Despite the high predictive accuracy of these approaches, they have limited scalability due to their dependency on time-consuming path exploratory procedures. In recent years, owing to the rapid advances of computational technologies, new approaches for modelling graphs and mining them with high accuracy and scalability have emerged. These approaches, i.e. knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models, operate by learning low-rank vector representations of graph nodes and edges that preserve the graph's inherent structure. These approaches were used to analyse knowledge graphs from different domains where they showed superior performance and accuracy compared to previous graph exploratory approaches. In this work, we study this class of models in the context of biological knowledge graphs and their different applications. We then show how KGE models can be a natural fit for representing complex biological knowledge modelled as graphs. We also discuss their predictive and analytical capabilities in different biology applications. In this regard, we present two example case studies that demonstrate the capabilities of KGE models: prediction of drug-target interactions and polypharmacy side effects.

Published slacklining literature is recent and limited, including for neuromechanical control strategy models. This paper explores slacklining's definitions and origins to provide background that facilitates understanding its evolution and progressive incorporation into both prehabilitation and rehabilitation. Existing explanatory slacklining models are considered, their application to balance and stability, and knowledge-gaps highlighted. Current slacklining models predominantly derive from human quiet-standing and frontal plane movement on stable surfaces. These provide a multi-tiered context of the unique and complex neuro-motoric requirements for slacklining's multiple applications, but are not sufficiently comprehensive. This consequently leaves an incomplete understanding of how slacklining is achieved, in relation to multi-directional instability and complex multi-dimensional human movement and behavior. This paper highlights the knowledge-gaps and sets a foundation for the required explanatory control mechanisms that evolve and expand a more detailed model of multi-dimensional slacklining and human functional movement. Such a model facilitates a more complete understanding of existing performance and rehabilitation applications that opens the potential for future applications into broader areas of movement in diverse fields including prostheses, automation and machine-learning related to movement phenotypes.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.5312/wjo.v12.i6.360,WOS,Journal

In these fields, the most important problem is the calculation of concept similarity. The study aims to explore the spatial mapping relationship between the general knowledge base and the professional knowledge base for the application of the general knowledge map in professional fields. With the core resource database (CRD) as the main body of the general knowledge and the institutional repository (IR) as the main body of the professional knowledge, the conceptual features of institutional expert knowledge were firstly abstracted from IR and inferred from small-scale datasets and the mathematical model was established based on the similarity of text concepts and related ranking results. Then, a two-set concept space mapping algorithm between CRD and IR was designed. In the algorithm, the more granular concept nodes were extracted from the information on the shortest paths among concepts to obtain a new knowledge set, the Expert Knowledge Recommendation System (EKRS). Finally, the simulation experiment was carried out with open datasets to verify the algorithm. The simulation results showed that the algorithm reduced the structural complexity in the calculation of large datasets. The proposed system model had a clear knowledge structure and the recommended accuracy of the text similarity was high. For small-scale knowledge base datasets with different sparsity, the system showed the stable performance, indicating the better convergence and robustness of the algorithm.

However, evolving literature in this field has unfortunately resulted in a multitude of innovation approaches leading to terminology confusion and fragmented literature. Hence, this study is an attempt to systematically organize and synthesize the research on innovation approaches originated in, for or from emerging markets. An extensive systematic review of the existing literature is carried out to investigate the progress of prior research, and to use the insights to define future research pathways. This review is primarily based on the most frequently used innovation approaches, especially frugal innovation, jugaad, disruptive innovation, Gandhian innovation, catalytic innovation, indigenous innovation, bricolage, blowback innovation, trickle-up innovation, resource-constrained innovation, and BOP innovation. Our analysis finds growing standardization in terminology usage and increasing emphasis on bottom-up and structured innovation approaches. De-emphasizing the role of technology transfers and spillovers from the West, the findings exhibit increasing applications of these innovations beyond emerging markets to wider markets. Our research results also shed light on the evolution of the topic and instigate further research explorations in the direction of analyzing the user adoption of these constraint-based innovations and understanding the influence of new technological advancements, such as the Internet, mobile telecommunications, and Web 2.0 on the innovation process, with a special focus on the service industry.",2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TEM.2016.2620562,WOS,Journal

Design/methodology/approach - Based on the content analysis of Ashoka Fellows, the study compares SEs in developed and developing countries, which represent strong versus weak NSIs. Findings - SEs selectively couple the elements of diverse institutional logics to ensure the resource inflow and legitimacy of their operations. However, SEs particularly at weak NSIs are also decoupling their profit and non-for-profit branches to address conflict among diverse logics. Moreover, the study finds that 12 out of 20 entrepreneurs who identify themselves as technologically innovative did not develop any new technological innovation. Practical implications - The study shows that being technologically innovative depends on the acquisition of resources and the management of legitimacy challenges, SEs can diversify their innovations by creating more incremental, architectural and modular innovations to address competing demands among logics. Social implications - The study reveals that SEs in weak NSIs interact with multiple institutional logics more frequently than their counterparts in strong NSIs. Although this context leads them to diversify their technological innovation, there is a need for improving the NSIs of SEs in developing countries to facilitate the continuity of resource inflow and ensure the legitimacy of their operations. Originality/value - Integrating two complementary theoretical lenses, the study contributes to the literature by exploring the impact of the interaction between logics nested within a supra system and SEs' ability to develop technological innovation.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/SEJ-05-2020-0034,WOS,Journal

The next wave of technology will not come, however, from new ways to bend the physical world to our will with steel and human power but from bits and bytes through digitalisation. Digitalisation is not new to our industry. Now the technology is cheaper and faster and the amount of data and level of connectivity are increasing exponentially, the application of digital technologies can deliver at an affordable cost. The energy industry is emerging from a lower-price environment in better shape and with more resilience and an increased focus on capital efficiency, cost performance and safety. The industry is also ready for a digital transformation that offers a big, if not the biggest yet, opportunity to improve efficiency in our existing operations even further. This transformative potential has been recognized for some years. What has been missing is a comprehensive approach for applying digital technologies successfully at scale in the oil and gas industry. This reflects one of the significant differences with previous waves of innovation: most of the benefit for existing businesses will come from replication and rapid improvement cycles of across many assets and projects. In addition, digitalisation also opens up the opportunity for new business models that could change the entire industry structure. This paper explores an approach to digitalisation that draws on successful use cases that have already realized significant value in Shell's operations. It identifies the underlying principles of the digitalisation strategy, including data strategy, approach to insourcing versus outsourcing and methodology of scaling up. The required success factors that underpin digitalisation are also explored: Capability building for both people and IT/data systems; how to organize the digital deployment; and the required leadership, culture and way of working attributes. Practical examples and insights from Shell's digitalisation journey will be provided.

(2017),The broken health information technology innovation pipeline: A perspective from the NODE health consortium,Digital Biomarkers,Digital health; Health information technology; Innovation; Outcomes,10.1159/000479017,"Background: The Network of Digital Evidence (NODE) was formed to further advance the field of health information technology (HIT) and evidence-based digital medicine at different healthcare institutions nationwide. As the NODE network reviewed the state of the field, it was noted that despite substantial financial and human capital investments, the processes and results of HIT innovation seem chaotic and subpar, especially in comparison to the more well-established drug and device industries. During the course of this white paper, we will explore the causes for this observed phenomenon as well as propose possible solutions to improve the state of HIT. Methods: We compared the entire process of discovery, proof of concept, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review, and postmarket monitoring and distribution/implementation of HIT innovations to the equivalent processes for drugs and devices. Whereas drug and device innovations are subject to a standardized pipeline of production, HIT innovations are not held to equivalent standards. Conclusions: As a result, HIT lags behind the more mature drug and device industries in producing effective and reliable products. This leads to an inefficient use of already scarce healthcare resources. The authors believe that the HIT industry must adopt many of the mechanisms implemented by the drug and device industries as dictated by their innovation pipelines of discovery, proof of concept, FDA review, and postmarket monitoring and distribution/implementation. We propose an eight-point plan to fundamentally evolve the HIT lifecycle, including reforms for institutions such as neutral government agencies, new health system boards and management systems, modified incentive structures, improved relationships with financial investors and start-ups, patient engagement, and enhanced mechanisms to improve HIT adoption.

Research has sought to explore the benefits of university science parks however, has produced inconsistent findings. Scholars suggest the need to look beyond internal factors such as the management, resources (human and financial), support mechanisms and business models, to consider the impact of external factors which may constrain or enhance the performance of university science parks. This research explores the factors which impact Turkish university science parks' patent performance. In particular, we focus on regional external factors such as how connections to triple helix actors, university type and how government supported technology transfer offices may influence patent performance within Turkish university science parks. The findings identify that the patent performance of Turkish university science parks increases when the science park is associated with research-oriented universities, providing all other elements are held constant. Mature, government funded technology transfer offices (TTOs) were also found to play a key role in increasing the number of patent applications. However, these effects change when considering the influence of having triple helix actor shareholders. The simultaneous existence of triple helix actor shareholders and research-oriented universities reduces the patenting performance of the university science park, when compared to research intensive universities without triple helix actor shareholders. Our findings provide novel contributions to university science parks in an underexplored context of Turkey and questions the value of patents as indicators of performance within Turkish university science parks.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10961-022-09929-x,WOS,Journal

However, recent technological advancements, along with parallel surge in clinical research have led to the concomitant establishment of other powerful computational techniques such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). These leading-edge tools with the ability to successfully predict side-effects of a wide range of drugs have eventually taken over the field of drug design. ML, a subset of AI, is a robust computational tool that is capable of data analysis and analytical model building with minimal human intervention. It is based on powerful algorithms that use huge sets of 'training data' as inputs to predict new output values, which improve iteratively through experience. In this review, along with a brief discussion on the evolution of the drug discovery process, we have focused on the methodologies pertaining to the technological advancements of machine learning. This review, with specific examples, also emphasises the tremendous contributions of ML in the field of biomedicine, while exploring possibilities for future developments.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1042/ETLS20200253,WOS,Journal

Perspectives from farmers lacking exposure to conservation agriculture,JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION & EXTENSION,,10.1080/1389224X.2018.1429283,"Purpose: To explore why substantial agricultural information gaps persist in African smallholder farming communities and how to reduce them. Design/methodology/approach: Using conservation agriculture (CA) as a case study, we deeply explore with 29 smallholder farmers why they are yet to obtain sufficient information to enable practice evaluation. Findings: Respondents asserted that their lack of information on CA was not reflective of a lack of interest in obtaining it, but of the unavailability and inaccessibility of learning opportunities. A deeper analysis revealed an underlying passive approach to seeking information and culture of financial expectancy. Practical implications: If extension systems are to catalyse broader sustainable intensification, we find the need for emphasis on (1) more inclusive extension mechanisms; (2) education of farmers about demand-driven extension; and (3) revision of direct input provision to lead farmers. Theoretical implications: While not contesting the value of farmer-to-farmer (F2F) extension systems for those socially connected to lead farmers, we find four research questions for further exploration regarding the practical application of F2F mechanisms that may impede their broader effectiveness, namely (1) Is extension coverage sufficient? (2) Do farmers understand demand-driven extension systems? (3) Do current incentive structures complicate farmer information seeking behaviour? and (4) Do current mechanisms encourage social stratification? Originality/Value: To date, adoption studies have largely utilised quantitative, econometric lenses that generally assume farmers are sufficiently aware of the technologies in question. Due to our in-depth qualitative analysis, we provide novel insights into how to close informational gaps that hamper efforts to increase the food and livelihood security of African smallholder farmers.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1389224X.2018.1429283,WOS,Journal

Building on affordance theory, we propose that digital innovations positively affect manufacturing firmsâ€™ performance via innovation speed and operational efficiency due to the affordance of digital technology. Moreover, the interactions between digital and institutional affordances suggest that the intellectual property rights (IPR) protection system (i.e. IPR regime and its enforcement) negatively moderates the relationship between digital innovation adoption and innovation speed, as well as operational efficiency. Results from a longitudinal sample of Chinese listed firms support our hypotheses.

This paper analyzes which of two common models of innovation over the technology life-cycle- - the product-process innovation shift observed for mass-produced goods or the system-component shift observed for complex products and systems- best describes the pattern of innovation in energy technologies. To this end, we develop a novel, patent-based methodology to study how the focus of innovation changes over the course of the technology life-cycle. Specifically, we analyze patent-citation networks in solar PV and wind power in the period 1963-2009. The results suggest that solar PV technology followed the life-cycle pattern of mass-produced goods: early product innovations were followed by a surge of process innovations in solar cell production. Wind turbine technology, by contrast, more closely resembled the life-cycle of complex products and systems: the focus of innovative activity shifted over time through different parts of the product, rather than from product to process innovations. These findings point to very different innovation and learning processes in energy technologies and the need to tailor technology policy to technological characteristics. They also help conceptualize previously inconclusive evidence about the impact of technology policies in the past. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In Brazil, the electricity sector regulation has mechanisms to foster innovation, including investments in R&D. Recently, the regulatory agency and the industry have been calling for approaches to increase the rate at which R&D departments generate solutions that end up being adopted. As a result, novel approaches to R&D project management have entered the agenda. In this context, the objective of this paper is to characterise Agile Product Development and its application in a highly regulated sector. The paper presents a systematic literature review with the debates about Agile and new product development. Then, a case study exploring an early adoption of the Agile approach in R&D project management in the Brazilian electricity sector is presented. Results include the identification of the Agile features most frequently mentioned in the literature.

However, without a proper collective knowledge management, its utilization as a strategic weapon or competitive advantage becomes difficult and inefficient. From an organizational perspective, the most important aspect of knowledge management is to transfer knowledge. In this regards, organizations must adopt structures that allow them to create and transfer more knowledge. Organizational communication structure affects the nature of human interactions and information flow which in its own turn can lead to a competitive advantage in the knowledge economy. However, in addition to that, social relationships between individuals in an organization can also be utilized to produce positive returns. In this article we emphasize the role of individual structural importance within an organizational informal communication structure as a mechanism for knowledge flow and speeding up organizational learning. Our experimental results indicate the fact that structural position of individuals within their informal communication networks can help the network members to have a better access to ongoing information exchange processes in the organization. The results of our analyses also show that organizational learning through an informal communication network of people in the form of scale-free connectivity pattern is faster comparing to the small-world connectivity style.",2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-016-3348-8,WOS,Journal

For the national defense department, timely and effective assessment of damage to or impending damage to dams and other structures is an important issue related to the safety of people's lives and property. In the field of damage assessment and vulnerability analysis, it is usually necessary to give the damage assessment results within a few minutes to determine the physical damage (crack length, crater size, etc.) and functional damage (decreased power generation capacity, dam stability descent, etc.), so that other defense and security departments can take corresponding measures to control potential other hazards. Although traditional numerical calculation methods can accurately calculate the crack length and crater size under certain combat conditions, it usually takes a long time and is not suitable for rapid damage assessment. In order to solve similar problems, this article combines simulation calculation methods with machine learning technology interdisciplinary. First, the common concrete gravity dam shape was selected as the simulation calculation object, and XFEM (Extended Finite Element Method) was used to simulate and calculate 19 cracks with different initial positions. Then, an LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) machine learning model was established. 15 crack paths were selected as the training set and others were set for test. At last, the LSTM model was trained by the training set, and the prediction results on the crack path were compared with the test set. The results show that this method can be used to predict the crack propagation path rapidly and accurately. In general, this article explores the application of machine learning related technologies in the field of mechanics.

Using the method of stochastic actor-oriented models and longitudinal data on registered building information modeling (BIM)-based construction projects in Shanghai, this study examines how the macro structure of the project-based collaborative network for BIM implementation in the regional construction industry evolves over time and how related micromechanisms collectively underpin the evolution of the network. The results provide evidence that the network becomes increasingly dense over time but persistently exhibits small-world properties and the core-periphery structure with a small number of super-connected star organizations. The results further reveal that these macrolevel characteristics of network dynamics significantly relate to the structure-based preferential attachment effect and the attribute-based ownership similarity effect operating at the microlevel. This study contributes to a deepened understanding of how industry organizations interact with each other in BIM implementation practices across projects within the project-based construction industry.

In this context, the use of memristors as coupling elements of the dynamics of chaotic circuits for adaptive synchronization purposes, was recently proposed and the passive crossbar array was evaluated as target interconnect medium. Nonetheless, memristors may suffer from defects and degradation. Therefore, this work evaluates the impact of memristor switching faults in an adaptive chaotic synchronization scheme, exploring at the same time the fault-tolerance of the crossbar architecture. Moreover, inspired from our observations in the stuck-at-OFF fault analysis of the memristive crossbar, some alternative scalable memristive interconnect patterns are suggested, whose performance is found independent of the number of interconnected chaotic circuits, requiring a much smaller number of total memristors than the crossbar array. All simulations are based on an accurate physics-based model of a bipolar memristor with filamentary switching mechanism. Based on our results, using the alternative topologies instead of the crossbar array leads to significant savings in the synchronization time that increase with the number of interconnected chaotic units, at the cost of more limited scaling capability and fault-tolerance.

Moreover, this emerging servitization literature is limited to the traditional lead-firm perspective within larger consortiums. To help redress the balance, our research studied six collaborative servitization projects in mobile information and communication technologies (mICT) to explore why some open innovation efforts succeed in simultaneous service and product innovation with a market application of innovative solution, while others do not. The study provides empirical evidence that only a small number of projects resulted in an effective servitization innovation solution. This conclusion emphasises the complexity of creating service innovation in the mICT sector. By comparing better performing servitization projects with those that were less successful suggests that higher performance, in terms of novel service development, requires more than mere strong intention, adequate leadership and change management competencies.

Access to various biological resources, fair and equitable sharing of benefits from the use of these resources and TK has become an important agenda after the CBD came into force. The debates are still going on the requirement for institutional mechanisms to regulate the access and benefit-sharing agreements, defining ownership of biological resources and their associated TK. With the advent in recent technologies, TK associated with natural biological resources and their economic and scientific importance has attracted a wide range of private sector stakeholders for their utilization. In the past, TK has often been accessed without the consent of the owners of TK and without sharing the benefits arising out of its utilization. Various measures for the protection of TK, through either adapted intellectual property rights or sui generis systems, are in vain as long as the holders of TK and the specific context in which TK has been generated, transmitted and preserved do not enjoy appropriate protection through the recognition of indigenous peoplesâ€™ rights. Indigenous rights can gain strength from progress made and legal standards set in international level elaborating measures for the protection of TK and vice versa. This chapter explores and reports the various negotiations on an international regime on access and benefit sharing in the framework of the Convention on Biological Diversity that provides a forum to push indigenous peoplesâ€™ right to their TK.

In this context, there is need for the development of new materials that realize high-performing and low-cost power sources. At the same time, advances in computational power, simulation, and Machine Learning enable researchers to explore large amounts of data, providing inspiration and tools for the design of new systems. In this work, we combined experiments with modeling and data analysis tools to build a framework for the study and development of high-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (HT-PEMFCs). The framework used Machine Learning tools (e.g., support vector regression, dimension reduction, and clustering) that seamlessly linked materials characteristics with fuel cell performance. This allowed for the accelerated discovery of material properties and fuel cell operating parameters that achieve greater power density while co-currently addressing costs. Â© 2020 The AuthorsHigh-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (HT-PEMFCs) are enticing energy conversion technologies because they use low-cost hydrogen generated from methane and have simple water and heat management. However, proliferation of this technology requires improvement in power density. Here, we show that Machine Learning (ML) tools can help guide activities for improving HT-PEMFC power density because these tools quickly and efficiently explore large search spaces. The ML scheme relied on a 0-D, semi-empirical model of HT-PEMFC polarization behavior and a data analysis framework. Existing datasets underwent support vector regression analysis using a radial basis function kernel. In addition, the 0-D, semi-empirical HT-PEMFC model was substantiated by polarization data, and synthetic data generated from this model was subject to dimension reduction and density-based clustering. From these analyses, pathways were revealed to surpass 1 W cmâˆ’2 in HT-PEMFCs with oxygen as the oxidant and CO containing hydrogen.

Model-based predictions of the disruptions induced by extreme events on urban infrastructure systems are often unreliable, as these events are unlikely by their very definition. Specifically, characterizing the effect of such disruptions to the urban infrastructure using a parameterized model is a difficult task. On the other hand, model-free approaches based on recent advancements in reinforcement learning can model the complex dynamics of urban society and infrastructure under the risk of extreme events explicitly without relying on any specific physics-based mechanism. However, these approaches usually require performing random exploration of the effects of management actions on the system (typically in the post-event situation) to allow for an acceptable approximation to the optimal management policy. When dealing with costly infrastructure systems and important communities, this random exploration can be unacceptable and risky. In this paper, we propose a method called Safe Q-leaming, which is a model-free reinforcement learning approach with addition of a model-based safe exploration for near-optimal management of infrastructure system pre-event and their recovery post-event. Our method requires the decision-maker to model the structure of the state space of the problem, and a suitable equilibrium of the system (optimum functionality pre-event). This information is usually available for urban systems, as they spend long time in optimum equilibrium before the occurrence of such events. We show on several examples of infrastructure management how the proposed approach is able to achieve near-optimal performance without the risk due to random exploration.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.strusafe.2019.04.003,WOS,Journal

This new model of care is challenging physiotherapists to work in new ways, and so an understanding of these roles is timely and wil contribute to the growing knowledge regarding these practitioners and their impact. Methods: This qualitative study aimed to improve the understanding of the clinical practice of first-contact clinicians in musculoskeletal healthcare. The study used a think-aloud method to explore eight cliniciansâ€™ views via a stage 1 semi-structured interview process. This was followed by a stage 2 focus group involving physiotherapists and a general practitioner trainer. A thematic analysis then followed, which involved the researcher and a research colleague coding the data and subsequently developing themes. Results: The themes identified were: medical assessment and systems knowledge; speed of thought in an uncertain environment; breadth of knowledge; people and communication skills; common sense/simplify; and responsibility and experience. Conclusions: The identified themes should help to underpin the competence, capability and training requirements for these new roles, and should be considered when developing new services utilizing first-contact primary care physiotherapy practice.

The combination of deep learning and topology optimization has become one of the hottest research fields at the moment. Different from most existing work, this paper conducts an in-depth study on the method of directly using neural networks (NN) to carry out topology optimization. Inspired by the idea from the field of â€œInverting Representation of Imageâ€ and â€œPhysics-Informed Neural Networkâ€, a topology optimization via neural reparameterization framework (TONR) that can solve various topology optimization problems is formed. The core idea of TONR is Reparameterization, which means the update of the design variables (pseudo-density) in the conventional topology optimization method is transformed into the update of the NN's parameters. The sensitivity analysis in the conventional topology optimization method is realized by automatic differentiation technology. With the update of NN's parameters, the density field is optimized. Some strategies for dealing with design constraints, determining NN's initial parameters, and accelerating training are proposed in the paper. In addition, the solution of the multi-constrained topology optimization problem is also embedded in the TONR framework. Numerical examples show that TONR can stably obtain optimized structures for different optimization problems, including the stress-constrained problem, structural natural frequency optimization problems, compliant mechanism design problems, heat conduction system design problems, and the optimization problem of hyperelastic structures. Compared with the existing methods that combine deep learning with topology optimization, TONR does not need to construct a dataset in advance and does not suffer from structural disconnection. The structures obtained by TONR can be comparable to the conventional methods.

Although considerable attention has been devoted to its emergent properties and selection outcomes, less focus has been given to understand how disruption emerges through evolving and complex interactions that occur during that process. To address this shortfall, this article draws on chaos theory to examine the nature of disruptive innovation as a nonlinear dynamic system. Disruptive innovation can be considered nonlinear because it is time-dependent and deviation-absorbing, and it revolves around identifiable types of attractors appearing in a deterministic context or trajectory. To illustrate and advance these ideas, we study inkjet printer and digital photography technologies using patent application data collected from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We employ a nonlinear analysis of the correlation dimension to measure the unpredictability of disruptive change and found that both chosen technologies evolved through a nonlinear dynamic process. Furthermore, in light of chaos theory and by way of comparison, we indicated two types of disruption: high-dimensional and low-dimensional chaos.

We sought to explore if novel ways to utilize teleICU services can emerge within an established, consulting-style teleICU model considering the programâ€™s flexible, provider-driven operation. Methods: This was a qualitative study of one teleICU/hospital dyad using semi-structured interviews from a convenience sample of ICU (n = 19) and teleICU (n = 13) nurses. Interviews were analyzed using directed content analysis to identify themes that describe their experiences with teleICU using a deductive codebook developed from an expert consensus (American Association of Critical Care Nurses) AACN statement on teleICU nursing. Results: Three themes were identified through the qualitative content analysis: [1] nurses described unique teleICU knowledge, including systems thinking and technological skills, [2] the teleICU partnership supported quality improvement initiatives, and [3] elements of the work environment influenced perceptions of teleICU and its use. When elements of the work environment, such as effective communication and role clarity, were not present, teleICU use was variable. Conclusions: Flexible, provider-driven approaches for integrating teleICU services into daily practice may help define the future use of the teleICU modelâ€™s applicability. Future work should focus on the importance of effective communication and role clarity in integrating the emerging teleICU services into teleICU/ICU practice.

Such BMs are run by multinational firms to accommodate various technologies and innovations; however, this is stressful because of inherent incompatibilities and conflicts. Design/methodology/approach - An explorative study of six product cases from Du Pont's Textiles Fiber Division (DTFD), namely, nylon yarns, knits and wovens, DTFD blockbusters, Coolmax (R), MicroMattique (TM), filling materials and Supriva (TM), is conducted. Findings - In value-creation, technology push or market pull yields resultant technology-forward or market-back trajectories. For value appropriation, new growth opportunities or continuous market expectations lead to breakthrough or continuous innovations. Consistent and inconsistent combinations of these trajectories yield four differential drivers: technological breakthrough, market-back technology, continuous technology and continuous market-back. This is supported by relevant supply chain strategies, either focused through joint ventures and licensees for commodities or vertically integrated for specialty products. Research limitations/implications - The paper adds to the analysis of ambidexterity in the value structure of BMs along constituent value-creation and appropriation, thus providing a logical lens to understand various complementarities that exist in terms of opposing technology trajectories and product innovation repertoire. Practical implications - This study contributes to the knowledge of product innovation management in the textile industry, where both large-scale innovation and operational excellence are challenged over the past few decades. Originality/value - The lessons learnt address the fundamental issue of higher value generation through configuration of multiple contrasting value-structure elements.",2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/RJTA-09-2016-0021,WOS,Journal

Exploring how the awareness of risk spreads and how it triggers a diffusion of coping strategies is prominent in the research agenda of various domains. It requires a deep understanding of how individuals perceive risks and communicate about the effectiveness of protective measures, highlighting learning and social interaction as the core mechanisms driving such processes. Methodological approaches that range from purely physics-based diffusion models to data-driven environmental methods rely on agent-based modeling to accommodate context-dependent learning and social interactions in a diffusion process. Mixing agent-based modeling with data-driven machine learning has become popularity. However, little attention has been paid to the role of intelligent learning in risk appraisal and protective decisions, whether used in an individual or a collective process. The differences between collective learning and individual learning have not been sufficiently explored in diffusion modeling in general and in agent-based models of socio-environmental systems in particular. To address this research gap, we explored the implications of intelligent learning on the gradient from individual to collective learning, using an agent-based model enhanced by machine learning. Our simulation experiments showed that individual intelligent judgement about risks and the selection of coping strategies by groups with majority votes were outperformed by leader-based groups and even individuals deciding alone. Social interactions appeared essential for both individual learning and group learning. The choice of how to represent social learning in an agent-based model could be driven by existing cultural and social norms prevalent in a modeled society.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0226483,WOS,Journal

We test and validate our hypotheses with panelized data of roughly 250,000 Chinese firms over a 7-year period (2001-2007). We also show that the salience of these mediation mechanisms is contingent upon ownership structure and industry characteristics: Non-state-owned enterprises and firms in industries with medium export intensity or medium and high new product development intensity effectuate more learning through these conduits than their counterparts.

The existing thread partition approaches mostly adopt one unique thread partitioning scheme for unknown programs, resulting in high misspeculation ratio, restricting the programsâ€™ speedup improvement due to inappropriate partitioning schemes. This paper which introduces an adaptive thread partition approach (AdapTPA), takes the relationship between program complexity and thread partitioning scheme as the research entry point, and uses the irregular programs as the research carrier, and utilizes formal analysis, probability statistics, mathematical modeling and simulation experiments to reveal the rule that programâ€™s characteristics affect speedup performance, and generates a compound thread partitioning scheme for one program, and selects and executes the most suitable thread partitioning scheme according to the runtime context and the programâ€™s complexity, so to achieve the expected maximum speedups. With the method of path statistics on one programâ€™s control flow graph, the programâ€™s complexity calculation model is set up; A candidate thread partitioning scheme set is constructed on the foundation of classical thread partitioning approaches; Using expert knowledge to guide production rules, a scheme selection mechanism that complies with program complexity is explored. Compared to the heuristic rules-based (HR-based) thread partitioning method, the experiment results show that AdapTPA delivers an average 18.24% performance improvement.

However, the relatedness between these dimensions of resilience in healthcare has not yet been studied. This study seeks to develop a conceptual understanding of adaptation and innovation as a basis for resilience in healthcare. The overall aim of this study is therefore to explore how adaptation and innovation can be described and understood across different healthcare settings. To this end, the overall aim will be investigated by identifying what constitutes adaptation and innovation in healthcare, the mechanisms involved, and what type of responses adaptation and innovation are associated with. Methods: The method used to develop understanding across a variety of healthcare contexts, was to first conduct a narrative inquiry of a comprehensive dataset from various empirical settings (e.g., maternity, transitional care, telecare), that were later analysed in accordance with grounded theory. Narrative inquiry provided a contextually informed synthesis of the phenomenon, while the use of grounded theory methodology allowed for cross-contextual comparison of adaptation and innovation in terms of resilience in healthcare. Results: The results identified an imbalance between adaptation and innovation. If short-term adaptations are used too extensively, they may mask system deficiencies and furthermore leave the organization vulnerable, by relying too much on the efforts of a few individuals. Hence, short-term adaptations may end up a barrier for resilience in healthcare. Long-term adaptations and innovation of products, processes and practices proved to be of a lower priority, but had the potential of addressing the flaws of the system by proactively re-organizing and re-designing routines and practices. Conclusions: This study develops a new conceptual account of adaptation and innovation as a basis for resilience in healthcare. Findings emerging from this study indicate that a balance between adaptation and innovation should be sought when seeking resilience in healthcare. Adaptations can furthermore be divided into short-term and long-term adaptations, creating the need to balance between these different types of adaptations. Short-term adaptations that adopt the pattern of firefighting can risk generating complex and unintended outcomes, but where no significant changes are made to organization of the system. Long-term adaptations, on the other hand, introduce re-organization of the system based on feedback, and therefore can provide a proactive response to system deficiencies. We propose a pattern of adaptation in resilience in healthcare: from short-term adjustments, to long-term reorganizations, to innovations.

The proliferation of UMI technologies will not only change the way we live but can also offer new learning opportunities. At the same time, there is an increasing need for skills that are associated with the UMI domain in the labour market. The Umi-Sci-Ed is an EU project which explores ways to shed new light into this training aspect by introducing several model educational scenarios that incorporate UMI technologies, in order to cultivate relevant competences on high school students. This paper reports initial results achieved in this context. In particular, we give an overview of the key components of the UMI-Sci-Ed platform that aims to support the activities of Communities of Practice involved in STEM education. Students through a mentoring mechanism are provided with training material, IoT hardware kits and software tools to explore UMI technologies through hands-on activities. In this framework, example educational scenarios and the corresponding UMI applications developed are presented. The hypothesis is that the learning process can be empowered by using such UMI applications as students are provided with meaningful opportunities to participate in the learning process such as in terms of building applications that are relevant to the subject they like and having active interactions within student groups in a way that practical experiences can provide them a rich context to grasp scientific knowledge. Finally, the results of a preliminary evaluation of the proposed approach in the context of an educational workshop are discussed.

The complexity of CoPS makes them at a much higher risk of innovation failure as compared to ordinary products. Hence, it is of much practical significance to conduct study on the learning-from-failure mechanism. From the perspective of employees, it is difficult to learn from failure and failure makes them feel stressed both physically and mentally. Thus, it is imperative for organizations to support their employees in learning from failure. For this reason, there has now been plenty of attention brought to the concern about how to transform perceived organizational support into the practice of employees to learn from failures in the academic and practical circles. However, the existing study on the mechanism of transmission between the two remains in its infancy, let alone the in-depth exploration into this mechanism between different types of learning from failure in combination with their distinctive characteristics. In this paper, perceived organizational support theory and self-determination theory are integrated to construct an influencing mechanism model of perceived organizational support on the learning behavior of employees (double-loop learning and single-loop learning). Besides, a test is carried out on the mediating role of self-efficacy, affective commitment and the sense of obligation, based on which the significance of different mediating effects is compared. The data used in this study was collected from four high-tech enterprises with the experience of innovation failure in complex products and systems over the past two years. A total of 467 valid questionnaires were recovered by matching leaders with employees. Besides, SPSS21. 0 was applied for basic descriptive statistical analysis and Mplus7. 0 was adopted to construct structural equation model. The results of the empirical analysis conducted using 467 pieces of matched data are detailed as follows. Firstly, the perceived organizational support shows positive correlation with learning from failures for employees ( double-loop learning and single-loop learning). Secondly, self-efficacy and affective commitment exert a mediating effect between perceived organizational support and double-loop learning from failures, while the sense of obligation causes a mediating effect between perceived organizational support and single-loop learning from failures. Thirdly, the mediating effect produced by self-efficacy and affective commitment between perceived organizational support and double-loop learning from failures is more significant as compared to the sense of obligation, despite no significant difference observed in the mediating effects between self-efficacy and affective commitment. Lastly, when compared with self-efficacy and affective commitment, the sense of obligation exerts a more significant mediating effect between perceived organizational support and single-loop learning from failures. However, there is no significant difference found in the mediating effects between self-efficacy and affective commitment either. From the theoretical perspective, the perceived organizational support theory is first applied in this study to account for the impact of organizational support on different types of learning from failures for employees and the pathway to such impact. The analysis expands the scope of application for the perceived organizational support theory. In addition, it contributes to promoting the study on the effect and mechanism of organizational support in face of crisis. Secondly, the â€œblack-boxâ€ mechanism between organizational support and different types of learning from failures is revealed in this study, thus improving the understanding as to the meaning, characteristics, influencing factors and formation mechanism of different types of learning from failures. Moreover, it advances the understanding as to the antecedents and formation mechanisms of different types of learning from failures. Thirdly, the context of innovation failure is integrated with self-determination theory in this study to demonstrate that self-determination theory provides a theoretical foundation for different types of learning from failures, which has made incremental contribution to the existing studies of self-determination theory and further expanded the scope of its application in the field of organizational behavior. From the practical perspective, the organization is supposed to build an internal multi-source support system to fully support the learning effort made by employees in the context of innovation failure. For enterprises, it is necessary to stimulate both the internal and external motivations of employees to engage with learning, and to adjust the intensity of both motivations in a timely manner, thus ensuring the overall optimal effect of learning from failures in practice Â© 2022,Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management.All Rights Reserved",2022,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126998052&doi=10.13587%2fj.cnki.jieem.2022.02.005&partnerID=40&md5=0a4ea6dcebca9119129b904605dfedb0,Scopus,Article

However, as the material syntheses become more complex, the meta-decisions of artificial intelligence (AI)-guided decision-making algorithms used in autonomous platforms become more important. In this work, a surrogate model is developed using data from over 1000 in-house conducted syntheses of metal halide perovskite quantum dots in a self-driven modular microfluidic material synthesizer. The model is designed to represent the global failure rate, unfeasible regions of the synthesis space, synthesis ground truth, and sampling noise of a real robotic material synthesis system with multiple output parameters (peak emission, emission linewidth, and quantum yield). With this model, over 150 AI-guided decision-making strategies within a single-period horizon reinforcement learning framework are automatically explored across more than 600 000 simulated experiments - the equivalent of 7.5 years of continuous robotic operation and 400 L of reagents - to identify the most effective methods for accelerated materials development with multiple objectives. Specifically, the structure and meta-decisions of an ensemble neural network-based material development strategy are investigated, which offers a favorable technique for intelligently and efficiently navigating a complex material synthesis space with multiple targets. The developed ensemble neural network-based decision-making algorithm enables more efficient material formulation optimization in a no prior information environment than well-established algorithms.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0sc06463g,WOS,Journal

In education, mobile devices are not only used as tools to reinforce information, motivate and accentuate engagement, but it additionally enables the delivery of course content. The adoption of authentic technological innovations using the variety of distinguishing attributes available on mobile devices could potentially promote a mobile learning enactment. Objective: The purpose of the study was to explore the experiences of undergraduate nursing students who participated in an authentic mobile learning enactment aimed at enhancing their learning experiences. Design: This study used a qualitative contextual design. Setting and Participants: Undergraduate nursing students, of a School of Nursing in a Faculty of Community and Health Sciences at a university in South Africa, were the study participants. All students (n = 101) registered for the primary care and clinical skills module were invited to submit reflections based on their experiences on an authentic mobile learning enactment using WhatsApp Messenger. Method: Students submitted electronic reflections after every two-week cycle of the enactment. The data collected was categorised into emerging themes as analysed by the researcher guided by Tesch's (1990) systematic process. An independent coder reviewed the data and, through consensus, themes identified were confirmed. Results: One hundred and one participants (n = 101; 100%) submitted online reflections on their experiences during the authentic mobile learning enactment. Seven themes were identified which included: mobile devices afforded a learning platform; mobile learning enactment enhanced engagement; learning within a group made learning easier; flexibility in time allocated to complete tasks; challenges experienced with data/airtime/Wi-Fi; impaired communication due to poor network access and use of mobile devices in practice perceived as unprofessional. Conclusion: The study provided valuable insights into studentsâ€™ experiences of the authentic mobile learning enactment, as well as suggesting ways to enhance the effectiveness of such an enactment.

(2022),Biomaterialomics: Data science-driven pathways to develop fourth-generation biomaterials,ACTA BIOMATERIALIA,,10.1016/j.actbio.2022.02.027,"Conventional approaches to developing biomaterials and implants require intuitive tailoring of manufacturing protocols and biocompatibility assessment. This leads to longer development cycles, and high costs. To meet existing and unmet clinical needs, it is critical to accelerate the production of implantable biomaterials, implants and biomedical devices. Building on the Materials Genome Initiative, we define the concept 'biomaterialomics' as the integration of multi-omics data and high-dimensional analysis with artificial intelligence (AI) tools throughout the entire pipeline of biomaterials development. The Data Science-driven approach is envisioned to bring together on a single platform, the computational tools, databases, experimental methods, machine learning, and advanced manufacturing (e.g., 3D printing) to develop the fourth-generation biomaterials and implants, whose clinical performance will be predicted using 'digital twins'. While analysing the key elements of the concept of 'biomaterialomics', significant emphasis has been put forward to effectively utilize high-throughput biocompatibility data together with multiscale physics-based models, E-platform/online databases of clinical studies, data science approaches, including metadata management, AI/ Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and uncertainty predictions. Such integrated formulation will allow one to adopt cross-disciplinary approaches to establish processing-structure-property (PSP) linkages. A few published studies from the lead author's research group serve as representative examples to illustrate the formulation and relevance of the 'Biomaterialomics' approaches for three emerging research themes, i.e. patient-specific implants, additive manufacturing, and bioelectronic medicine. The increased adaptability of AI/ML tools in biomaterials science along with the training of the next generation researchers in data science are strongly recommended. Statement of significance This leading opinion review paper emphasizes the need to integrate the concepts and algorithms of the data science with biomaterials science. Also, this paper emphasizes the need to establish a mathematically rigorous cross-disciplinary framework that will allow a systematic quantitative exploration and curation of critical biomaterials knowledge needed to drive objectively the innovation efforts within a suitable uncertainty quantification framework, as embodied in 'biomaterialomics' concept, which integrates multiomics data and high-dimensional analysis with artificial intelligence (AI) tools, like machine learning. The formulation of this approach has been demonstrated for patient-specific implants, additive manufacturing, and bioelectronic medicine. (c) 2022 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach - There is hardly any study on emerging economies that explored the causal chain of R&D-innovation-productivity, considering the role of market power in a structural model. Taking advantage of the availability of firm-level data and following the extended version of the Crepon, Duguet and Mairesse (CDM) model, we intend to fill the gap. The CDM model first explores the link between R&D and innovation, then the latter's impact on productivity. Besides, it captures sectoral heterogeneity and the differing roles of technological and institutional innovation on productivity. Findings - The manufacturing firms that held a higher markup had a more significant contribution to driving innovation than services one. While institutional innovation affected productivity positively, technological innovation had the opposite impact. Nevertheless, firms' higher degree of monopoly, in general, worsened productivity outcomes. The estimated results are robust to a range of alterations. Practical implications - The study offers implications for the competition policy of ASEAN.

OA is noted as a critical resource in achieving product, process, and business model innovations. By adopting an inductive case study of a US MNC subsidiary in India, we found empowerment-focused HRM practices were being used for exploration of new ideas and efficiency-focused HRM practices were adopted for the exploitation of the organisation's existing strengths. Empowerment-focused HRM practices created a culture of openness and risk-taking, which facilitated the creation of an ambidextrous context. Further, ambidextrous learning was moderated by the adoption of a managerial/leadership style that focused on 'mirroring competencies' between the parent operation and its subsidiary. HRM practices were aimed at developing behaviours that valued the team-based co-development of graphic processor designs by means of a 'parallel processing' approach to product development. Additionally, the HRM practice of offering intrinsic employee rewards and both informal and formal training facilitated OA in delivering product innovation.

(2018),University students' educational interests and perspectives on Social and Solidarity Economy,CIRIEC-ESPANA REVISTA DE ECONOMIA PUBLICA SOCIAL Y COOPERATIVA,,10.7203/CIRIEC-E.94.12782,"Introduction Social and solidarity economy in higher education combines three key aspects in strengthening organizations in the sector: the complementarity of empirical, theoretical and interdisciplinary knowledge; the improvement of social and business skills in leaders, workers and associates; and, in a broader sense, the promotion of skill acquisition in students as active citizens and entrepreneurs. This has been noted in some studies, in which researchers have made visible pedagogical models, teaching strategies and impacts of including social and solidarity economy contents and practices in undergraduate and graduate programs on the educational community, organizations and society. In accordance with the literature review, most studies have reported the perspective of professors or managers on educational experiences, but little is known about students' involvement in these processes. Consequently, it is appropriate to continue exploring the educational potential of this relationship as a contribution to the quality and relevance of higher education and, in turn, the development of social and solidarity economy as an alternative for social transformation. Objetives This article derives from an educational research process whose objective is to analyze the questions asked by university students about social and solidarity economy, giving an account of their educational interest and perspectives. Materials and Methods The study was conducted under educational research guidelines, the hermeneutic approach and descriptive-interpretative research guidance, assuming that student asks questions from their particular interest and prior knowledge. It involved 96 university students whose undergraduate curriculum includes social and solidarity economy education and who, at the time of the study, were enrolled in one of the specific courses on the subject. The technique employed to gather information was the focal group and the instrument used was a workshop called Question Tree that caused students to ask open questions on social solidarity economy. Questions were later categorized in a double-entry analysis matrix: dimensions of social and solidarity economy and types of questions according to the complexity level of the knowledge required by them. Results/Limitations/Implications Students' questions reflect their interests, expectations and cognitive processes; 170 questions were asked which, regarding the dimensions of solidarity economy, mostly reflect (49%) a pragmatic interest on the current reality of this socio-economic model, followed by an emerging category that questioned the educational strategy for the subject, especially in terms of didactics (22%). There was no particular interest in the theory. The types of questions are mainly those reflecting critical thinking and active citizenships to support social transformation (41%), followed by those looking into data (36%), which points out the need for supplementary strategies to even out basic knowledge of the topic. In some cases, there is certain skepticism about the reality and project of social and solidarity economy. Findings imply subsequent research to develop teaching strategies and the proposed topics, showing the potential of questions to trigger innovative educational processes centered on students' learning and experiences. Another alternative for future studies is to apply the same data collection instrument to a statistically representative sample of the studied population, which this qualitative research presents as a limitation to establish correlations by gender, age group, region of the country, and program. Conclusions/Originality The condensed results of the study indicate that, for university students, social and solidarity economy as a reality, theory and project becomes contents and practices that favor critical and systemic thinking, interdisciplinarity, analytical resolution of social problems, cooperative work, creativity, entrepreneurship and social innovation. Also, students demand significant learning and active participation in knowledge building based on experiences that are motivating and aimed at responding to challenges such as those posed by the problems of today's society. In this respect, the relationship between higher education and social and solidarity economy is an opportunity to introduce educational innovation that broadens students' skills to be active citizens, know about social and solidarity economy, and undertake solidarity enterprises and social innovation in the territory. In doing this and using technologies, they could join a global movement that is being consolidated by academic and union networks. This presents challenges to professors and the development of educational approaches that, based on interaction and the students' interests, knowledge and expectations, focus on learning and experience in personalized processes. Higher education in social and solidarity economy, with its potential to contribute to sustainable development, has not been sufficiently explored. While educational agendas and the social solidarity economy movement highlight the importance of young people and their role in the generational connection required to strengthen their organizations, little is known about their interests and expectations. The originality of this research then lies in the fact that it does not build on the questions asked to young students, which generally guide most studies, but on the voice of students who, with their questions and the method used, provide a baseline that can be replicated, compared with other realities, and supplemented as part of a teaching strategy applicable at different formal and non-formal educational levels that further solidarity education. Therefore, this study replicated in other higher education contexts may help to improve approaches, contents and methods to enable better coordination between education and a scenario of professional performance in the social and solidarity economy sector, taking the jobs it creates and, from entrepreneurship, establishing new organizations or providing new products and services to territories.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.7203/CIRIEC-E.94.12782,WOS,Journal

Moreover, such fertilizers may also result in a major public health hazard: increased antibiotic resistance. This article discusses the critical implications of perturbations in N cycle caused by excessive use of fertilizers and resulting policy implications as they relate to ecosystem services. While there are solutions such as cover crops, these solutions are expensive and inconvenient for farmers. We advocate the use of biological fixation (BF) for staple cropsâ€”microbiome mediated natural supply of fixed N. This would involve engineering a microbiome that can be grown cheaply and at industrial scale. Fertilizers resulting from such innovation are termed as â€œbiofertilizersâ€ in this article. Following a qualitative cost-benefit analysis broken down by key stakeholders and a quick exploration of policy frameworks as they relate to the advancement of biofertilizers, we propose a practical pathway of where and how research investments should be directed to make such a solution feasible. We make five policy recommendations for decision-makers to facilitate a successful trajectory for this solution: (1) Future agricultural science should seek to understand how BF might be employed as a practical and efficient strategy. This effort would require that industry and the government partner to establish a pre-competitive research laboratory equipped with the latest state-of-the-art technologies that conduct metagenomic experiments to reveal signature microbiomes and form novel symbiotic connections. (2) To have a smooth ride in the market, ag-bio companies should: (i) create awareness among farmers; (ii) impart skills to farmers in testing and using biofertilizers, and (iii) conduct extensive field tests and more research in studying the scalability potential of such fertilizers. (3)The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and state governments should provide research and development (R&D) tax credits to biotech companies specifically geared towards R&D investments aimed at increasing the viability of BF and microbiome engineering. (4) To control agricultural pollution in the biosphere, federal governments should consider passing a Clean Agriculture Act (CAA), including a specific clause that regulate the use of chemical fertilizers. (5) Governments and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) should coordinate Biological Advanced Research in Agriculture (BARA)â€”a global agricultural innovation initiative for investments and research in biological fixation and ethical, legal, and social implications of such innovation. While biological fixation will be central in BARA, we envision it to conduct research around other agricultural innovations as well, such as increasing photosynthetic efficiency.

Model Based Design (MBD) and early simulation have proven to be capable technologies to perform initial design space analysis to optimize system design. Traditional MBD methods and tools typically rely on fixed elements, which makes difficult the evaluation of different platform configurations, communication alternatives or models of computation. Addressing these challenges require flexible design technologies able to support, from a high-level abstract model, full design space exploration, including system specification, binary generation and performance evaluation. In this context, this paper proposes a UML/MARTE based approach able to address the challenges mentioned above by improving design flexibility and evaluation capabilities, including automatic code generation, trace execution collection and trace analysis from the initial UML models. The approach focuses on the definition and analysis of the paths data follow through the different application components, as a way to understand the behavior or the different design solutions.

(2019),Region-Enhanced Multi-layer Extreme Learning Machine,COGNITIVE COMPUTATION,,10.1007/s12559-018-9596-3,"Deep neural networks have made significant achievements in representation learning of traditionally man-made features, especially in terms of complex objects. Over the decades, this learning process has attracted thousands of researchers and has been widely used in the speech, visual, and text recognition fields. One deep network multi-layer extreme learning machine (ML-ELM) achieves a good performance in representation learning while inheriting the advantages of faster learning and the approximating capability of the extreme learning machine (ELM). However, as with most deep networks, the ML-ELM's algorithmic performance largely depends on the probability distribution of the training data. In this paper, we propose an improved ML-ELM made via using the local significant regions at the input end to enhance the contributions of these regions according to the idea of the selective attention mechanism. To avoid involving and exploring the complex principle of the attention system and to focus on the clarification of our local regional enhancement idea, the paper only selects two typical attention regions. One is the geometric central region, which is normally the important region to attract human attention due to the focal attention mechanism. The other is the task-driven interest region, with facial recognition as an example. The comprehensive experiments are done on the three public datasets of MNIST, NORB, and ORL. The comparison experiment results demonstrate that our proposed region-enhanced ML-ELM (RE-ML-ELM) achieves performance increases in important feature learning by utilizing the apriori knowledge of attention and has a higher recognition rate than that of the normal ML-ELM and the basic ELM. Moreover, it benefits from the non-iterative parameter training method of other ELMs, and our proposed algorithm outperforms most state-of-the-art deep networks such as deep belief network(DBN), in the aspects of training efficiency. Furthermore, because of the deep structure with fewer hidden nodes at each layer, our proposed RE-ML-ELM achieves a comparable training efficiency to that of the ML-ELM but has a higher training speed with the basic ELM, which is normally the width single network that has more hidden nodes to obtain the similar recognition accuracy with the deep networks. Based on our idea of combining the apriori knowledge of the human selective attention system with the data learning, our proposed region-enhanced ML-ELM increases the image classification performance. We believe that the idea of intentionally combining psychological knowledge with the most algorithms based on data-driven learning has the potential to improve their cognitive computing ability.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12559-018-9596-3,WOS,Journal

In this paper, the role of parental involvement in shaping the school learning climate is explored within a multilevel and hierarchical modeling framework using data from the 2015 PISA round. As the schoolsâ€™ social and relational character, we find that reducing learning barriers is a critical challenge for school leadership. A welcoming environment for parents, as well as the effective design of effective forms of two-way communications, are positively associated with a substantial reduction in the barriers to improving teacher managementâ€™s learning climate. We also find that public schools facing social and educational inclusiveness challenges can dramatically enhance their learning environment by activating specific parental involvement mechanisms. Similarly, principalâ€™s leadership in framing and communicating goals and curricular development to the school is also found to be significant for inclusiveness. However, parental involvement is also found to have potential tensions with school management. The worsening of the learning climate may arise due to pressures brought about by laws requiring parental involvement in schools. Because the learning climate is composed of a wide variety of relationships between and within schools, this work demonstrates that parental involvement is an integral part of school leadership and the school improvement process. Further research attention is encouraged to understand the tensions between teacher roles, principal leadership, and parental involvement through employing other quantitative or qualitative research designs.

(2021),Heterogeneous Relational Graph Neural Networks with Adaptive Objective for End-to-End Task-Oriented Dialogue,KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS,,10.1016/j.knosys.2021.107186,"End-to-end task-oriented dialogue systems, which provide a natural and informative way for human- computer interaction, are gaining more and more attention. The main challenge of such dialogue systems is how to effectively incorporate external knowledge bases into the learning framework. However, existing approaches usually overlook the natural graph structure information in the knowledge base and the relevant information between the knowledge base and the dialogue history, which makes them deficient in handling the above challenge. Besides, existing methods ignore the entity imbalance problem and treat different entities in system responses indiscriminately, which limits the learning of hard target entities. To address the two challenges, we propose Heterogeneous Relational Graph Neural Networks with Adaptive Objective (HRGNN-AO) for end-to-end task-oriented dialogue systems. In the method, we explore effective heterogeneous relational graphs to jointly capture multi perspective graph structure information from the knowledge base and the dialogue history, which ultimately facilitates the generation of informative responses. Moreover, we design two components, shared-private parameterization and hierarchical attention mechanism, to solve the overfitting and confusion problems in the heterogeneous relational graph, respectively. To handle the entity imbalance problem, we propose an adaptive objective, which dynamically adjusts the weights of different target entities during the training process. The experimental results show that HRGNN-AO is effective in generating informative responses and outperforms state-of-the-art dialogue systems on the SMD and extended Multi-WOZ 2.1 datasets.

This study aims to develop a team-level model of mediating and moderating mechanisms behind the relationship between team-focused transformational leadership (TFL) and team service innovation. Data were collected from 683 team members and their 114 team leaders of 67 hospitality organisations located in China. Multilevel structural equation modelling (MSEM) and latent moderated structural equation modelling (LMS) were utilised to validate the research model. Results revealed that team-focused TFL fostered team service innovation via the mediating role of developmental culture. Group extraversion diversity strengthened the relationship between team-focused TFL and team service innovation, such that the relationship was strengthened only under higher but not lower levels of group extraversion diversity.

However, it remains a challenge for most students to complete scientific inquiry tasks without proper support. Research evidence has suggested the potential of reflective scaffolding when applying scientific inquiry. Accordingly, we designed a contextualised reflective mechanism-based AR learning model to assist students in completing scientific inquiry tasks. Guided by the proposed model, we designed four stages of scientific inquiry learning: conceptual understanding, reflective cognition, in-depth inquiry, and knowledge building. A quasi-experiment and lag sequential analysis were conducted by recruiting 81 sixth-grade students to examine the effects of the proposed model on their scientific inquiry learning performances, higher order thinking, and behavioural patterns. The experimental results reveal that the proposed approach improved students' inquiry learning performances and higher order thinking tendency (problem-solving tendency and metacognitive awareness). Moreover, the evidence from this study also suggests that the students who learned with the proposed approach exhibited more observation, comparison, exploration, and reflection behavioural patterns in the field trip than those who learned without the contextualised reflective mechanism.

Studies have examined the Top Management Team (TMT) actions and decisions with the ambidextrous orientation of a firm. Further, studies have also shown that a behaviourally integrated TMT is positively associated with organizational ambidexterity. However, there has been limited research examining the antecedents to the behaviourally integrated TMT. Anchored in the upper echelons perspective, we have examined the influence of TMT processes and mechanisms on organizational ambidexterity. The TMT is observed to positively influence ambidexterity by enhancing the firm's ability to meet the differentiation-integration challenges, and by facilitating the effective deployment of ambidextrous Human Resource (HR) architectures for employee learning. Thereby, this investigation examines the effect of TMT processes and mechanisms in enabling structural as well as contextual ambidexterity. The results from a sample of 78 hi-tech Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) across different industries were analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling. We find the mediating role of TMT behavioural integration in the effect of TMT connectedness and TMT cross-functional interfacing mechanisms on organizational ambidexterity.

Emerging industries based on technological innovation have increasingly become an important driving force for industrial competitiveness and economic growth. Although regional innovation systems (RISs) boost regional industries, it remains under-investigated whether and how RISs have differential impacts on different industries. Inspired by Pavitt's taxonomy of sectorial innovation, we propose four paradigms of industrial innovation in the context of emerging industries in China. We also empirically explore the effects of RISs on emerging industries, distinguishing the short-term effects from long-term ones. We present two key findings. First, RISs have generally contributed to the growth of emerging industries in China. Second, different components of RISs have varied impacts on different emerging industries. The results provide both theoretical underpinnings and empirical evidence for policy-makers, suggesting that well-designed policies that leverage RIS formation and regional industry specific characteristics are vitally important for development of emerging industries. Our study makes three important contributions. First, it theorizes a conceptual framework on possible mechanism through which RISs promote emerging industries. Second, this study sheds empirical light on both short-term and long-term effects of individual RIS components on seven emerging industries in the Chinese context. Third, the paper proposes four paradigms of industrial innovation in emerging industries under the RIS framework.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.technovation.2021.102388,WOS,Journal

Live video, prerecorded video, and their combination are the three main video learning modes. Parental involvement emerges as a unique factor that may influence online learning effects. Students' behaviors such as interaction, engagement may vary from traditional online learning context due to multiple reasons. Hence, the previous acceptance models are not applicable. In this paper, by modifying and extending the Expectation Confirmation Model, a unified acceptance and continuance intention model (UACIM) is proposed to explore the factors affecting students online learning continuance intention. Confirmation is omitted for the lack of a priori knowledge. Perceived ease of use is included as the factor assessing technology performance. Parental involvement, interaction, and students' engagement are considered as external variables. The hypotheses are validated by the data collected from 306,139 students from Grade 4 to Grade 9 in Hubei Province, China. The results of structural equation modeling reveal that all variables are significant in explaining continuance intention, which indicates the vital roles of the external factors. Some negative correlations are found with suggestions that practitioners should be prudent when implementing interactions as well as offering individualized instructional designs. Furthermore, three video learning modes are found to be successful. The most preferable way is the hybrid mode with the most interactions, engagement, strongest satisfaction, perceived usefulness, and continuance intention. There are significant differences among three groups for most paths. Therefore, appropriate interventions can be devised to enhance learning effects and continuance intention when utilizing different video learning.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10447318.2021.1938389,WOS,Journal

More specifically, this study investigates the relationship between productivity and customer satisfaction and its effect on a firm's performance. In addition, this study investigates the roles of productivity and customer satisfaction in the structural relationships among variables. Design/methodology/approach A theoretical model was proposed among innovation, productivity, customer satisfaction and firm performance. A sample of 127 firms from data sets of the American Customer Satisfaction Index and COMPUSTAT was collected. To test the hypotheses, this study used ordinal least squares analysis and path analysis. Findings The findings of this study verified that a positive relationship exists between productivity and customer satisfaction and that service productivity and customer satisfaction are positively associated with a firm's performance. In addition, customer satisfaction was found to fully mediate the relationship between productivity and a firm's performance. Research limitations/implications This study only focused on a short period for each variable due to the difficulty of matching all the data sets used for measuring each variable, which limited the observation of the different effects of service productivity among industries. Practical implications The findings of this study suggest that managers can improve productivity without sacrificing customer satisfaction. In addition, services firms should consider innovation, productivity and customer satisfaction in a holistic way because all of these affect a firm's performance. Furthermore, services firms need to pay more attention to customer satisfaction, which plays an important role as a mediator in increasing a firm's performance. Originality/value This study highlights the importance of the relationship between productivity and customer satisfaction in the services sector. In particular, this study extended the theory of service productivity by Rust and Huang (2012) to explore the role of service productivity and customer satisfaction in measuring a firm's performance.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJQRM-01-2017-0019,WOS,Journal

Professionals need mechanisms with adaptive capabilities to enable knowledge transfer, since the necessary experience and expertise are usually spread among different professionals. To provide a shared understanding, Augmented Reality (AR) has been explored. In this paper, which is part of ongoing research using a human-centered design approach with partners from the industry sector, we describe a framework using annotations to improve the shared perceived realities of different professionals. The framework allows manually freezing the on-site professional context and sharing it with a remote expert to create annotations. Then, the on-site professional can visualize instructions through aligned and anchored annotations, using a see-through Head Mounted Display (HMD). In addition, annotations based on real-time video stream from a remote expert are also available. Hand tracking is used to manipulate the annotations, enabling the adjustment of their position and scale in the real-world according to the context, thus enriching the on-site professional experience and improving visualization of information while conducting maintenance procedures suggested by a remote expert.

We address key challenges faced by policymakers developing innovation strategies for emerging technologies. In particular, we explore ways that FM might be structured to investigate the complex innovation system journeys of novel technologies as they are developed, diffused, and deployed. In doing this, we draw on concepts from technology and operations management and related literatures to more carefully characterise the: (1) 'technical infrastrucutre' required to develop emerging technologies; (2) key technology transitions involved in diffusion; and (3) complex industrial value networks into which they may eventually get deployed. We investigate the extent to which these categories are already used within national technology foresight exercises. In particular, we review over 240 international FTA-related policy, strategy, and analysis documents for 'advanced materials'. We find that - although generally used inconsistently and unsystematically within FTA - these categories repeatedly emerge as important elements in many policies, strategies, and underpinning foresight exercises. We conclude by arguing that these categories should be carefully considered in initial FTA design. And that, by doing so, FTA exercises may better reveal potential 'innovation system failures' and help policymakers coordinate policy actions in response. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

A post-session questionnaire was used to collect data. A partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) analysis was then conducted to test an extended technology acceptance model conceptualized from a priori theoretical deduction and previous empirical findings. The extended model featured the constructs of Imagination, Immersion, and Interaction as exogenous variables with Perceived Ease of Use and Perceived Usefulness in mediating roles leading to the endogenous construct of Behavioral Intention to Use. Results of the confirmatory PLS-SEM analysis revealed inherent problems with the model's application to the high-immersion virtual reality system and program used. Considering these findings, a PLS-SEM exploratory model optimization analysis was conducted which saw the variable of Immersion best relocated to be a predicator for both the Interaction and Imagination constructs. This exploratory model showed superior predictive relevance and improved significance of the relevant construct paths. Based on these results, this paper provides new theoretical reasoning that is in line with these statistical findings, namely that the construct of Immersion is best positioned as a singular external exogenous variable impacting Interaction and Imagination for the high-immersion virtual reality technology acceptance model used in this study.

In the context of advocating for corporate sustainable development and green governance, this study uses data from China's Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listed companies in heavily polluting industries spanning 2008-2019 to empirically explore the relationship between corporate EID and green innovation (GI). The results reveal the following: (1) high-quality EID significantly promotes the absolute GI level and the relative GI level of enterprises. (2) An intermediary model found that the internal mechanism of corporate EID used to promote GI mainly comes from the government's energy-saving innovation subsidy effect and the social media attention effect. (3) Corporate EID has a more evident promotional effect on green patents for energy conservation and green patents for inventions. (4) The EID of state-owned enterprises is more conducive to GI than to the activities of private enterprises. (5) The EID of enterprises in high-level administrative cities has no significant impact on GI. However, it has a significant promoting effect in low-level administrative cities.

From semi-structured text and unstructured text, the candidate entity upper-lower relationship entity pairs are extracted, and then the obtained candidate upper-lower relationship entity pairs are verified by the support vector machine method to obtain high-quality candidate entity pairs. In the training phase, an exploratory method is designed to search for the optimal solution, and a greedy mechanism is introduced to evaluate the effectiveness of the reinforcement learning agent, so that the virtual node mapping scheme can continuously move towards higher system returns. Evolution has finally achieved the optimal virtual network mapping decision, so that large-scale tasks can be deployed to task processing nodes in the appropriate underlying network to achieve efficient task execution in a big data environment.

However, predicting the future is always easier said than done. In this regard, Arthur's theory (The nature of technology: what it is and how it evolves, Free Press, New York, 2009) on the nature of technologies and how science evolves, coupled with Kuhn's theory of scientific revolutions (Kuhn in The structure of scientific revolutions, 1st edn, University of Chicago Press, Chicago, p 3, 1962), may serve as the basis of a shrewd methodological framework for forecasting recombinative innovation. These theories help us to set out quantifiable criteria and decomposable steps to identify research patterns at each stage of a scientific revolution. The first step in the framework is to construct a conceptual model of the target technology domain, which helps to refine a reasonable search strategy. With the model built, the landscape of a field-its communities, its technologies, and their interactions-is fleshed out through community detection and network analysis based on a set of quantifiable criteria. The aim is to map normal patterns of research in the domain under study so as to highlight which technologies might contribute to a structural deepening of technological recombinations. Probability analysis helps to detect and group candidate technologies for possible recombination and further manual analysis by experts. To demonstrate how the framework works in practice, we conducted an empirical study on AI research in China. We explored the development potential of recombinative technologies by zooming in on the top patent assignees in the field and their innovations. In conjunction with expert analysis, the results reveal the cooperative and competitive relationships among these technology holders and opportunities for future innovation through technological recombinations.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-019-03218-5,WOS,Journal

(2017),Technological Uncertainty and Firm Boundaries: The Moderating Effect of Knowledge Modularity,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT,,10.1109/TEM.2016.2638847,"One fundamental challenge of technology and innovation management is for firms to decide which future technologies to develop in-house versus buying them outside. This challenge is particularly pertinent when industries emerge, typically a time of high levels of technological uncertainty. It has been long understood that technological uncertainty functions as important stimulus for firms to manage their boundaries. However, two to some extent competing strategy perspectives-governance and competence-predict that firms faced with uncertainty would either increase or decrease their scope of activities, respectively. To reconcile these conflicting positions, we propose a model in which knowledge modularity moderates the effect of technological uncertainty on firms' research and development (R&D) scope decisions. We develop new measures for R&D scope, knowledge modularity, and technological uncertainty, drawing on population ecology, network theory, and technology management. We test our model empirically using data on patenting activity and firm boundary location in the emerging automotive air bag industry. Our results generally support our model and show that in case of knowledge-generating activities such as R&D, scope decisions under technological uncertainty are more driven by concerns about the risk of obsolescence than the risk of opportunistic behavior. We discuss implications for managerial practice and future research.",2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TEM.2016.2638847,WOS,Journal

Moreover, and especially in the health and care fields, service design as an approach to service innovation increases. Application of service design processes has promising potential for developing holistic and well-functioning solutions through a fundamental human-centred focus and extensive interdisciplinary and intersectoral collaboration and co-creation. This chapter takes a design education perspective to health-related service design by presenting the characteristics of a new master course which aims to offer design students a dedicated space for addressing societal challenges, particularly connected to healthcare, and introducing service design methodology. First, the rationale behind the course is elucidated, and the course structure and theoretical pillars are described. Next, a student project is used as an exemplifying case to illustrate practical, methodological and theoretical applications. Finally, some reflections and lessons learned are presented. Scrutinising the work of design students is valuable because, compared to business and consultancy projects, the academic environment often encourages and allows for a more idealistic approach that explores and critically reviews theories, methods and tools. As such, the chapter is expected to be relevant for practitioners and lecturers working with healthcare and health-related design.

The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) was used as the theoretical framework. Empirical data (with 215 valid responses) were collected nationwide from the United States via Qualtrics Panel services. Exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation modeling, and multi-group comparison (chi-square difference) were used to estimate construct validity and test the proposed hypotheses and theoretical framework. Results indicated that consumersâ€™ purchase intention towards face masks was predicted by consumersâ€™ attitude towards functional attributes, subjective norm, and perceived behavior control. But, in contrast with previous research, purchase intention was not predicted by attitudes towards aesthetic attributes and attitude towards social attributes. Purchase intention positively influenced consumersâ€™ actual purchase behavior towards face masks. Workplace association moderated the path from social attitudes to purchase intention. Based on these results, theoretical and practical implications are discussed. Â© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

However, theoretical and empirical knowledge about how EMNEs address CS is still scant, and the relationship between internationalization and CS has not been widely explored. This study aims to fill this gap, evaluating the relationship between an international ambidexterity strategy and CS in EMNEs, which highlighted the paradox perspective. Then we develop three hypotheses in which we argue how the dynamic capabilities underpinning international ambidexterity could be considered a driver of CS in EMNEs. We test the developed hypotheses against data from 300 Chinese EMNEs obtained by a survey. Our results contribute to shape ambidextrous international strategies and to consider CS as a springboard for the strategic intent to systematically and recursively outperform global competition. Testing a measurement scale of international ambidexterity, we suggest structural ambidexterity as a strategic option of internationalization that allows the achievement of economic, social, and environmental sustainability objectives.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bse.2490,WOS,Journal

With the current propensity to focus research in digital game- based language learning on vernacular games, or commercially available games that are designed with entertainment in mind, it is vital to focus on the extramural setting in which these games are designed to be played, while still being subject to rigorous and empirical analysis. This article examines the extramural gameplay and language- learning trajectories of four university German- language learners as they play World of Warcraft with native German speakers. Positioning learners' experiences within a complex adaptive systems framework (Larsen- Freeman & Cameron, 2008; de Bot & Larsen- Freeman, 2011), the change that each learner undergoes while playing the game over the course of four months is explored in detail. Understanding the game environment as an affinity space (Gee, 2005) helps to substantiate how a game, independent of instructor guidance or classroom intervention, can still promote SLD amongst language learners of varying experiences and proficiencies. The results of this study suggest that numerous factors influence the success of a language learner's extramural gameplay experience, but that these factors must be analyzed in conjunction with the emergent internal and external resources of the complex adaptive system as language learners play and interact with other players in a context removed from the traditional classroom.",2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1558/cj.29527,WOS,Journal

Whilst many professional service firms have a broad range of in-house and consulting expertise, professional groups within and between these organisations may not be generating and sharing the knowledge required for successful water accounting. The purpose of this paper is to explore how additional disciplinary skills for water volumetric measurement, understanding of licensing and allocations can effectively and efficiently be shared between the disciplines required to be involved. Design/methodology/approach Two cross-sectional semi-structured surveys developed using a social network lens were disseminated to Australian accountants operating in professional services firms, and the results were descriptively analysed. Findings The authors find that, whilst accounting and engineering are acknowledged as core disciplines for water accounting, there is a need for more standardised measures and frameworks across diverse scales to fit in with current reporting practices and meet stakeholder needs. These need to be nested in a water accounting regulatory model that includes the accountancy professional bodies as a platform for knowledge generation and sharing. Originality/value The paper provides evidence of perceived barriers to and pathways for interdisciplinary knowledge networks for a new type of accounting. It demonstrates how regulatory frameworks can potentially assist rather than impede accountants in their contribution to solving of complex corporate sustainability problems.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/PAR-01-2018-0004,WOS,Journal

(2022),Navigating the paradox of global scaling,GLOBAL STRATEGY JOURNAL,,10.1002/gsj.1435,"Research summary Much global strategy research explores the management of competing strategic demands. Although these demands vary by a firm's context, the focus has been largely on established long-lived multinational enterprises (MNEs) that are not based on digital technologies. There is thus a need to extend theory to take into account the co-existence of rapid growth and digitization, a condition which is increasingly prominent. This study of globally scaling digital firms shows that they navigate the paradoxical demands of replication, to achieve frictionless rapid growth, and entrepreneurship, to innovate and remain competitive. We provide a theoretical model, which shows how MNEs navigate this global scaling paradox through a virtuous cycle of identifying innovations that can be replicated. Surprisingly, given the ease of modifying digital products and services, navigating the global scaling paradox involves minimizing local responsiveness, which is regarded as antithetical to replication. This research also builds insights on the global strategies of digital firms. Managerial summary Many digital firms strive to scale globally to achieve market dominance in competitive, fast-paced industries, but only a few succeed. Studying software-as-a-service firms that have successfully scaled globally, we illustrate that the core demands of global scaling are replication and entrepreneurship. Although contradictory, both demands need to be satisfied in tandem. Leaders of globally scaling firms can achieve this through a strategy that sustains three interrelated mechanisms: top-down replication, bottom-up entrepreneurial orientation, and replicable innovation generation to engender and screen replicable ideas. These mechanisms represent a virtuous cycle through which globally scaling digital firms can revise their global business model in a replicable way in order to sustain competitiveness.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/gsj.1435,WOS,Journal

Traditional quantitative remote sensing methods are mainly model-driven, emphasizing inversion through mathematical or physical models. With the development and popularization of artificial intelligence technology, data-driven methods have gradually received widespread attention. It emphasizes the use of machine learning methods to mine the information contained in remote sensing observation data to achieve the quantitative inversion of geophysical parameters. With the support of powerful computing capacity, the data-driven method has achieved gratifying achievements in many fields of quantitative remote sensing. This article systematically summarizes the principles, characteristics, and applications in quantitative remote sensing field of different types of data-driven models, including regression algorithms, regularization methods, instance-based algorithms, decision tree, Bayesian methods, kernel based algorithms, genetic algorithms, ensemble learning, artificial neural network, and deep learning. Though data-driven models show satisfying retrieval performance in multiple fields, its drawbacks of ignoring the laws of physics and lack of causality have also brought resistance to its development. In this context, coupling the laws of physics and machine learning to develop an inversion framework driven by both models and data has become a new research hotspot. Some pioneering researches have already achieved delightful performance through using machine learning to assist physical models or restricting machine learning with physical laws. Using machine learning techniques to optimize the systematic basis, the sub-model, and the model parameters largely improve the performance of model-driven methods. Meanwhile, integrating physics knowledge into machine learning models through adjusting the training data, modifying the loss function, and constraining the solution space also benefit the improvement of data-driven models. However, there are still great challenges to be broken through. Physical models contain complex mechanisms and rich knowledge, current fusion of data-driven and model-driven methods are quite shallow with very limited amount of physical knowledge being used. A deeper coupling strategy is worth exploring in the future. Besides, the uncertainty, generalization, and transferability of the joint model have not been scientifically evaluated currently, to which attention should be paid. Finally, there are many cases when the training samples were very difficult to obtain, therefore, the applicability of the joint model in the case of small samples is also a problem that needs to be solved urgently. The deep, robust, and generalizable coupling of data-driven and model-driven models is expected in the future. Â© 2022, Science Press.

Workplace learning theories highlight how individual agency and workplace structures dynamically interact to produce change within individuals and learning environments. Promoting awareness of individual biases shaped by clinical learning environments may therefore represent a unique type of workplace learning. We sought to explore how individuals and the workplace learning environment interact once awareness of implicit biases are triggered within learners. In accordance with longitudinal case study methodology and informed by constructivist grounded theory, we conducted multiple longitudinal interviews with physician and nurse participants over 12Â months. Our results suggest that implicit bias recognition provokes dissonance among participants leading to frustration, and critical questioning of workplace constraints. Once awareness is triggered, participants began reflecting on their biases and engaging in explicit behavioural changes that influenced the perception of structural changes within the learning environment itself. Collaboration, communication and role modeling within teams appeared to facilitate the process as individual and workplace affordances were gradually transformed.

Climate-induced rural-urban migration is a profound concern, and Dhaka's political leaders have embraced technology-based innovation as one solution pathway. This article explores the societal impact of Dhaka's innovation environment strategies for climate change adaptation and mitigation. Employing a case study qualitative methodology, our three findings expand knowledge about innovation for urban climate adaptation and mitigation as understood by Dhaka-based entrepreneurs. First, the most effective innovations were not the most technologically advanced, but those with the highest degree of participant ownership. Second, gaps between recipient, corporate and governmental understandings of effective mitigation and adaptation harmed projects were driven by different definitions of risk and competing understandings of vulnerability. Third, even the most technical climate adaptation measures were inherently political in their application. We discuss how to better position urban climate innovation infrastructures in Bangladesh and beyond, including developing a better recognition of innovation lifecycles for urban climate adaptation and widening our definitions of innovation to better incorporate more effective and inclusive climate adaptation solutions.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12219115,WOS,Journal

Constructed upon the knowledge-based view, the purpose of this study is to investigate the influencing factors of knowledge enhancement of corporate universities. Design/methodology/approach This paper takes 34 Chinese corporate universities as samples. The influencing factors and interrelationships are checked through exploratory case study and multi-case analysis. A stimulate-action model of influencing factors is built up based on the multi-case analysis. The fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis is used to examine configurational paths for knowledge enhancement. Findings The research finding shows that only a single element of knowledge management does not constitute a necessary condition for knowledge enhancement of corporate university and explored the concurrent synergy effect and linkage matching mode of multiple conditions of knowledge management. Most of the knowledge-enhanced corporate universities are of strengthening the knowledge process, which shows that sorting out the knowledge process is the core of the corporate university. Originality/value Unlike the existing research, the external teachers and combing of external knowledge processes are the key factors; this paper proposed that the internal teachers and sorting out the knowledge process within the enterprise play a central role in the knowledge enhancement of corporate universities. The path of high-knowledge enhancement and without high-knowledge enhancement is asymmetry.

This paper aims to explore the potential motivation of knowledge convergence and find the law of knowledge convergence, taking the solar energy field as an example. We established Keywords co-occurrence networks of solar energy literature in 2008â€“2017, and then link prediction is introduced to study the structural mechanism of knowledge convergence. We found that: (1) the common neighbor index better characterizes the knowledge convergence pattern in the knowledge networks among four similarity indicators. (2) The keywords co-occurrence network could effectively mine the structural characteristics of knowledge convergence; (3) the convergence cycle of knowledge in the field of solar energy was about 4Â years; (4) keywords with higher betweenness centrality or eigenvector centrality easily generated knowledge convergence; (5) a literature knowledge convergence prediction model is proposed based on these results; and (6) the prediction results showed that scholars should pay attention to six basic issues including energy storage, efficiency, cost, ecological effect, application scenarios, and hybrid photovoltaic systems. This work can provide guidance not only for scholars to grasp the research direction and to generate more innovations but for the government to formulate the policies of government funding.

The research undertakes an in-depth case study based approach. It uses data triangulation, where multiple sources of evidence (interviews, conference audio recordings and documents) are collected from the case organisation (a vendor) and its service ecosystem partners in the ICT sector. The partners included in the study are distributors, channel partners, competitors, and customers. B2B alliances are driven by the motivations to maximise strategic value and minimise transaction cost. Thus, using the ecosystem lens, we find that actors' capabilities (resources and perceived value), vendor's approach to achieving strategic benefit and the channel governance mechanism enable value co-creation. However, using the transaction cost theory lens, we report that actors' opportunistic behaviour, technological disruptions and new business model challenges lead to value co-destruction (in the form of termination of relationship, conflict and business liquidation). Alliance partners need to evaluate the strategic benefits of collaboration, knowledge sharing, learning, trust building, market expansion and technology sharing, considering partners' self-serving behaviour driven by transaction cost economies. All ecosystem actors are seeking to develop capabilities, exhibit knowledge differentiators, demonstrate technology leadership, reduce uncertainty and respond to new business model challenges thus causing value co-destruction. Thus, this research is more encompassing because it explores factors that lead to both value co-creation and co-destruction.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102093,WOS,Journal

Providing toilets has often not been a sustainable solution because of failure to link them to the necessary service infrastructure. Resolving urban sanitation problems in low-income countries requires innovations in approaches covering infrastructure, technology, social embedding, financial mechanisms and cost recovery. This paper explores the potential challenges and contribution of NGOs in facilitating new, integrated solutions to urban sanitation problems that address the entire sanitation chain, promising better social, financial and environmental sustainability. A case study of a sanitation project initiated by a large Dutch NGO is presented, using reconstruction of project documentation and interviews with project stakeholders. The analytical framework combines elements from Transition Management (TM) with insights from process approaches to development projects and community development. The choice of the TM concept is motivated by the notion that the new NGO approaches could be conceived as efforts to initiate a sustainability transition process in urban sanitation, whereas its complementation with insights from the development studies domain answers to the need to attune a TM-based framework to participation in the socio-institutional context in low-income countries, to understand the progress of governing transition processes in informal, low-income settings. This context requires special attention for capacity-building and creation of organizational structures in poor local communities. The case study shows that this entailed specialised groundwork, with which the NGO laid a crucial foundation that enabled transition frontrunners to act. Simultaneously, this focus on bottom-up empowerment created challenges for the NGO in effectively involving the right frontrunner actors who could put pressure on incumbent societal structures and institutions. We conclude that transitions in low-income contexts require extra attention to local empowerment and institution building to lay the required foundations for a locally rooted transition process. Development NGOs like the one in our case study have the skills to do this, but need to learn how to combine these with additional necessary competences to facilitate systemic change.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2017.08.011,WOS,Journal

Two case studies provide preliminary evidence that a well-balanced portfolio of controls can result in the design and implementation of novel product features. We position the case studies in the context of digital platforms to bound our definitions of control mechanisms and novelty. Based on analysis of data collected from two case studies, we find that formal and informal control modes can positively influence novelty in software applications on digital platforms.

(2018),Blending context-aware challenges into learning environments,Proceedings of the European Conference on Games-based Learning,BEACONING; Beacons; GPS; Metagame; Minigame; STEM,,"There is a growing expectation for educational environments to be more flexible and more engaging, not only for students, but also for teachers. Project-based Learning and cooperative learning have emerged as opportunities to create motivating learning contexts that focus on teaching students how to find information, how to test the information they have discovered, and then how to apply that information in a creative way for a specific purpose. Moreover, it is important to consider that students, once integrated into the work force, are not individual performers. Key skills have evolved to a blend of competencies that range from STEM skills to social ones. It is equally important that students explore the skills that are not part of the standard curriculum and they learn how to collaborate, how to be self-aware, how to empathize, how to work out conflicts and so on. However, creating such rich learning contexts requires extra efforts from teachers, and existing educational tools still need to become more user friendly to encourage actual adoption. Even if opportunities for innovation exist, these have not been fully exploited and large-scale implementations remain an issue. This paper explores the added-value that context-aware services can bring to education and presents the construction process of context-based gamified learning paths that support multi-skill acquisition. The implementation is supported by an Authoring Tool for Context-aware Challenges (AT-CC) and minigames developed within the BEACONING Project. AT-CC is a tool that enables teachers, acting as learning designers, to create metagames, which are pervasive, game-driven experiences that increase student motivation and engagement. The metagames created with the AT-CC tool integrate minigames into the context-based experiences, so, when students are playing, they have the opportunity to enhance their knowledge and skills. Teachers can easily customize both the context-aware paths and the minigames to create new experiences adapted to new locations and specific learning objectives. Â© 2018, Dechema e.V.

Design/methodology/approach - The perspectives of 47 key informants, predominantly representatives of public and private Uruguayan institutions, including chambers of commerce and producer associations, were gathered through unstructured, face-to-face interviews. Findings - Aligned with the KBTF, the significance of tacit knowledge, complemented with explicit knowledge, was revealed, particularly in the more traditional industries. Indeed, industry-based (tacit) knowledge evolving for generations has been strengthened by innovative practices, enhancing the appeal and image of key commodities and the nation's exports.

The market-oriented reform of fossil energy prices is yet incomplete, resulting in distortions which have significant implications for China's GEE. This study measures different types of fossil energy price distortions and GEE based on panel data, and also analyzes how these fossil energy price distortions affect GEE using the System-GMM model. Additionally, potential influencing mechanisms are explored. The main results show that (1) all fossil energy prices are distorted, with coal and oil having larger distortions. Additionally, regional energy price distortions are characterized as low in eastern China and high in the central and western regions. (2) Fossil energy price distortions exhibit significant negative impacts on GEE from a national perspective. The sub-group analysis also shows negative effects on GEE but different regions have heterogeneous impacts. (3) Mechanism analysis illustrates that negative fossil energy price distortions further hinder GEE by inhibiting technological innovation and impeding the optimization of the energy consumption structure. It is necessary to improve market-based energy pricing mechanism and develop differentiated regional energy pricing policies for the realization of China's green economy.

At the same time we are also interested in discovering interesting and impactful new work outside of our direct area of expertise. Zeta Alpha is a new Scientific Literature Recommendation platform specialized for AI and Data Science teams, that aims to make it easy to discover, organize, and share knowledge, and to stay up-to-date. At the time of submission, the platform is operational and already has a small and growing active user base. Based on our user research, we have come to a number of design principles which differ from existing systems in this area. recommendations need to be tailored to diverse sets of topics of personal interest the attention budget per user is very limited and variable the information need is time critical and the supply of relevant material is very bursty all new publications suffer from the cold start problem The basis of profiling a user's topics of interest in our platform is the documents they save to their collection using tags. The system supports the creation of document collections and tags on the fly and provides query by example search to populate these tags with very little manual effort. We generate candidate recommendations using an ensemble of diverse strategies that try to balance relevance, exploration and coverage across a user's tags (see [1, 4] for earlier related work), as well as control bias in the feedback loop. Separate recommenders in the ensemble are based e.g. on document similarity in keyword and document embedding vector spaces, on impact signals like social media mentions and author citation scores, and on author and citation links. The work we will present, focuses on learning robust settings for the combination strategies in this ensemble from small amounts of click data. This requires us to work with practical heuristics to estimate the system's parameters per strategy and use the data available to estimate a small amount of combination parameters only. The use of an ensemble learning framework allows us to combine evidence from complex strategies which produce heterogeneous ranking metrics. It also enables the use of individual strategies' mechanisms to provide explanations of recommendations to users [2, 3]. Our practical challenges are in particular how we can deal with the sequential nature of this recommendation stream, how to follow user's changing interests over time, and how to combine the rankings of different ensemble strategies to present recommendations that are at the same time topically relevant to the user's tags as well as impactful based on reputation or popularity signals. We will discuss how the application context of Scientific Literature Recommendation differs substantially from common data sets and frameworks used in academic research into state-of-the-art recommender systems, and our engineering challenges in moving from a offline learning approach to online learning. Next to an overview of our system architecture, we will also present a user study with 20 users and a relevance evaluation on our domain.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3460231.3474619,WOS,Conference Paper

The study on open innovation in financial institutions and, in particular, in the Brazilian banking sector, is still incipient and lacks empirical evidence that deals with its relevance in a dynamic and competitive environment. The research was developed through the qualitative approach, of the exploratory and descriptive, with the application of semistructured interviews. We used document analysis and observations in a guided technical visit. To analyze the data, the content analysis technique was used based on categories defined a priori embodied in the researched literature: innovation management model; Sources of innovation (internal and external); And an organizational environment focused on open innovation. The results obtained evidenced that the financial institution has many aspects of closed innovation, related mainly to organizational structure and culture. Likewise, there was evidence the little use of open innovation mechanisms, with the exploitation of few sources of external relations for the promotion of innovation. It can be concluded from the study that the organization is in an intermediate stage, which integrates both characteristics of closed innovation and now open innovation.",2017,,WOS,Journal

Therefore, this study examines the mechanism through which three forms of team strategic orientation (technology orientation, market orientation, and entrepreneurial orientation) simultaneously influence on NPD success. Using the resource-based view, this study proposes a theoretical framework in which team creativity and team innovation implementation mediate team strategic orientations on NPD success.

Research on adaptive governance has flourished since the field's inception, probing the process and mechanisms underpinning the new approach while offering various justifications and prescriptions for empirical use. Nevertheless, recent reviews of adaptive governance reveal some important conceptual and practical gaps in the field, particularly concerning challenges in its application to real-world cases. In this paper, we respond directly to the empirical challenge of adaptive governance, specifically asking: which methods contribute to the implementation of successful adaptive governance process and outcomes in practice and across cases and contexts? We adopt a systematic literature review methodology which considers the current body of empirical literature on adaptive governance of social-ecological systems in order to assess and analyse the methods affecting successful adaptive governance practice across the range of existing cases. We find that methods contributing to adaptive governance in practice resemble the design recommendations outlined in previous adaptive governance scholarship, including meaningful collaboration across actors and scales; effective coordination between stakeholders and levels; building social capital; community empowerment and engagement; capacity development; linking knowledge and decision-making through data collection and monitoring; promoting leadership capacity; and exploiting or creating governance opportunities. However, we critically contextualise these methods by analysing and summarising their patterns-in-use, drawing examples from the cases to explore the specific ways they were successfully or unsuccessfully applied to governance issues on-the-ground. Our results indicate some important underlying shared patterns, trajectories, and lessons learned for evidence-based adaptive governance good practice within and across diverse sectors, issues, and contexts.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.05.067,WOS,Journal

These learning processes represent a valuable source for entrepreneurship development in incumbent enterprises in the forms of innovative products, services, processes or organizational renewal. Design/methodology/approach: An extreme case study is the project â€œMimprendoâ€ (www.mimprendo.it), an initiative promoted by the Italian Conference of the University Colleges and the Italian Association of Young Entrepreneurs in collaboration with Italian universities. This is analyzed in the period 2009-2015, during which seven editions were developed. Findings: A framework is presented based on collaborative EL processes to perform relevant entrepreneurial projects in knowledge-intensive enterprises. The framework provides a coherent and systematic approach to generate, select and implement entrepreneurial practices in incumbent companies starting from a project competition involving creative students and innovative entrepreneurs. EL processes in the community composed of entrepreneurs, experts and university students are grouped into the entrepreneurial phases of inspiration, exploration, exploitation, acceleration and growth, and include the learning processes of â€œintuition and sensing,â€ â€œcontamination,â€ â€œexperiential and contextual learning,â€ â€œexperimenting and actingâ€ and finally â€œthinking and reflecting.â€ Research limitations/implications: Implications for research can be identified according to many perspectives to deepen the centrality of the learning process in the research on knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship. Practical implications: The framework results to be a promising approach to diffuse an entrepreneurial culture both in incumbent enterprises and in university students through a synergic collaboration among industry, university and institution. Practical implications could be derived for enterprise, students and educators involved in the design of innovative learning initiatives to sustain the development of an entrepreneurial mind-set. Originality/value: The framework contributes to extending an emerging research area exploring entrepreneurship as a never-ending dynamic learning process. The involvement of brilliant university students in activating EL process with entrepreneurs in incumbent enterprises represents a novel aspect in the field of entrepreneurship and innovation.

To capitalize on successful innovative instruments, it is essential that these are reused. However, reuse can be problematic in project-based public client organizations. This paper aims to apply the ambidexterity concept of integration mechanisms to examine how such reuse can be facilitated. Design/methodology/approach: An initial framework is developed to conceptualize and contextualize the ambidexterity integration mechanism for the procurement function of a multi-project public client. Concluding that, in this situation, an organizational procedure is an appropriate interpretation of the integration mechanism, a design science project is carried out to develop and implement a procedure in a real-life setting. Findings: Reconstructed reuse patterns confirm the need to have an actionable integration mechanism implemented. Integration, in the sense of drawing benefits from successful one-off innovative procurement instruments, may fail unnoticed if not organized and deliberately managed. The procedure developed in the design science project demonstrates how such integration can be achieved. Originality/value: Although research on ambidexterity has grown exponentially in the past decade, it is yet to be applied in the field of public procurement.

With role-emerging placements increasingly being offered, the learning processes experienced by students warrants further investigation. This research explored the learning experiences of students, from both supervisor and student perspectives, over the duration of a role-emerging placement in schools, to contribute to our understanding of this important student learning process. Method: Action research was used across four cycles with 14 students and 11 supervisors. Data were collected through reflective field notes, placement documentation and semi-structured interviews. Findings were analysed using template analysis. Findings: Limited established occupational therapy procedures and role models meant that the students created and used knowledge differently from role-established placements. The procedural knowledge upon which students most heavily relied in previous placements was largely inaccessible to students. Students relied on occupational therapy conceptual and dispositional knowledge, with the support of their peer and supervisor to guide practice. Tensions were seen between providing a service for the school and taking the necessary time to understand and implement the occupational therapy process systematically. Conclusion: Role-emerging placements are valuable for transformational student learning. These placements do, however, present challenges that require careful negotiation and structured guidance.

The light-asset nature of digital technologies provides the potential to not only facilitate an immediate crisis response, but also to catalyze novel innovation types to address the societal and economic changes caused by exogenous shocks. As digital innovation became a relevant part of organizationsâ€™ COVID-19 responses, and given that a corresponding structured knowledge base did not exist, we found the need to better understand crisis-driven digital innovation. Drawing on prior knowledge from crisis management and organizational ambidexterity as a theoretical lens, we present four patterns of crisis-driven digital innovation, classified along two dimensions: (1) driven by a sense of urgency or ambition and (2) focusing on exploitative or explorative innovation. Based on a thorough analysis of digital innovation cases during the COVID-19 crisis, we illustrate and discuss these four patterns and their emerging properties to explain how and why they led to digital innovation in the context of the crisis. Our work contributes to the explanatory knowledge on digital innovation in times of crisis, helping researchers and practitioners to understand and develop digital innovation in response to exogenous shocks.

However, the understanding of the process by which eco-innovations are developed and commercialized as a result of these drivers is not yet well established, in particular because these drivers are perceived differently by the end-users and their suppliers. In this paper, we address the following research question: How do eco-innovation drivers shape processes in value-creating networks? To answer this question, we carried out a case study purposely selected to understand how eco-innovation drivers, such as regulation, market pull and technology, interact and affect the eco-innovation decisions in a given industry. We analyzed the processes in an eco-innovation initiative about retrofitting old ships, contextualized in the maritime equipment and supply industry. The paper makes two novel contributions: First, we develop a framework that can support supply-network eco-innovation initiatives to deal with changes at the regulatory, market and technology levels. The framework includes elements, such as value co-creation to explore technological opportunities emerging from the interaction of the drivers or value proposition development to align multiple actors' interests in the network and agree on shared expectations to exploit the opportunities. Second, we contribute to the emerging research area on eco-innovation processes by highlighting the lesser-known role of value-creating network dynamics. Value-creating networks can be a platform for the development of more radical eco-innovations if actors in the networks can align their value creation and capture objectives.",2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su9050733,WOS,Journal

(2021),Federated Learning Meets Blockchain in Edge Computing: Opportunities and Challenges,IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL,,10.1109/JIOT.2021.3072611,"Mobile-edge computing (MEC) has been envisioned as a promising paradigm to handle the massive volume of data generated from ubiquitous mobile devices for enabling intelligent services with the help of artificial intelligence (AI). Traditionally, AI techniques often require centralized data collection and training in a single entity, e.g., an MEC server, which is now becoming a weak point due to data privacy concerns and high overhead of raw data communications. In this context, federated learning (FL) has been proposed to provide collaborative data training solutions, by coordinating multiple mobile devices to train a shared AI model without directly exposing their underlying data, which enjoys considerable privacy enhancement. To improve the security and scalability of FL implementation, blockchain as a ledger technology is attractive for realizing decentralized FL training without the need for any central server. Particularly, the integration of FL and blockchain leads to a new paradigm, called FLchain, which potentially transforms intelligent MEC networks into decentralized, secure, and privacy-enhancing systems. This article presents an overview of the fundamental concepts and explores the opportunities of FLchain in MEC networks. We identify several main issues in FLchain design, including communication cost, resource allocation, incentive mechanism, security and privacy protection. The key solutions and the lessons learned along with the outlooks are also discussed. Then, we investigate the applications of FLchain in popular MEC domains, such as edge data sharing, edge content caching and edge crowdsensing. Finally, important research challenges and future directions are also highlighted.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2021.3072611,WOS,Journal

However, things have started to change, owing to the increased adoption of data democratisation processes, and the capability offered by emerging technologies for data sharing while respecting privacy, protection, and security, as well as appropriate learning-based modelling capabilities for non-expert end-users. This is particularly evident in the energy sector. In this context, the aim of this paper is to analyse AI and data democratisation, in order to explore the strengths and challenges in terms of data access problems and data sharing, algorithmic bias, AI transparency, privacy and other regulatory constraints for AI-based decisions, as well as novel applications in different domains, giving particular emphasis on the energy sector. A data democratisation framework for intelligent energy management is presented. In doing so, it highlights the need for the democratisation of data and analytics in the energy sector, toward making data available for the right people at the right time, allowing them to make the right decisions, and eventually facilitating the adoption of decentralised, decarbonised, and democratised energy business models.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14144341,WOS,Journal

Previous studies suggest that serious play workshops tend to focus on scenarios, problem solving and reflective processes, with limited considerations for joint co-creation and learning potentials within innovation laboratories. Motivated by the creative prospects of metaphoric representations and shared stories, this study explores the possibilities of harnessing LSP for co-creative learning in innovation laboratories. This case study draws theoretical insights and practical relevance from a co-creative learning workshop involving three learning scenarios within a Middle Eastern and emerging economy context. Findings from the workshop show variability in representations, interactions and reflections, shaping possibilities for co-creative learning in innovation laboratories. Representations focus on systems, solutions and problems during fragmented, model-supported, model-mediated and integrated interactions that underpin a range of instance-based, variance-based, convergence-based and divergence-based reflections. These insights contribute to co-creation literature that views value creation as an amalgamation of open, collaborative and user innovation.

We conducted a two-stage questionnaire survey and collected data from 231 employees from four companies located in Wuhan, P.R. China. SPSS and Mplus are used for testing our model, and the results are shown as following: TL positively affects the BO of employees. Besides, SE plays a mediating role in the relationship between TL and bootlegging, and perceived TE has a moderating effect between TL and SE. Also, perceived TE moderated the indirect effect of TL on bootlegging via SE.

We develop a framework for sustainable business model innovation at the base of the pyramid by undertaking content analysis of 65 newspaper articles (interviews with senior executives and founders of digital app-based platforms, expert analysis) as well as social media and YouTube testimonials of UR business users of these platforms in Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. Using the Gioian coding structure of open and second order comparative coding, we develop a framework for sustainable business model innovation from the base of the pyramid perspective. The framework captures how digitalisation enables the UR businesses to circumvent resource shortages, consolidate procurement and inventory management and diversify product and service offerings, which leads to significant economic and social transformation for both the micro enterprises and their owners. Our framework contributes to the emergent literature on sustainable business model innovation and inclusive innovation in resource-constrained contexts.

Giant oil fields are declining in their production worldwide and this situation is creating need for search of new conventional and non-conventional fossil reserves. With steep depletion of major onshore and shallow-water-offshore oil fields new search of fossil fuel is moving towards deep-water and ultra-deep water offshore fields. Obviously new reserves are located in extreme, hostile and hard-to-reach environmental conditions. Exploration, development and production of oil from such difficult offshore fields have many serious challenges to health, safety and environment (HSE) therefore, require sophisticated technological innovations to support increasing energy demand. Biggest oil spill accidents in explosion of Deepwater Horizon offshore oil platform are burning example of such challenges which human society cannot risk to repeat. Therefore, development of advance drilling system, more accurate and intelligent inspection mechanism, faster responsive system in cases of unfortunate incidence and efficient damage control system is need of the safer future. Successful implementation of robotics, in space and manufacturing industry, is an critical example of how robotic assistance and automation is the only option for safe and cost-effective production of oil in foreseeable future. Teleoperation of unmanned drilling and production platforms, remote operated vehicles (ROVs), autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), under-water welding, welding robots for double hulled ships and under-water manipulator are such key robotic technologies which have facilitated smooth transition of offshore rigs from shallow waters to ultra-deep waters in modern time. Considering the sensitivity of product and difficulty of environment, most of these technologies fall under semi-autonomous category, where human operator is in loop for providing cognitive assistance to the overall operation for safe execution.

The intuitive path begins with a gamification design that reflects the customers' proactive and innovative behavior; the cognitive path begins with persuasion knowledge remarks based on rational and reactive reasoning. These two paths conclude what forms user co-creation. The study collects data of 505 active social media users in Taiwan and employs structural equation modeling. The empirical findings demonstrate persuasive knowledge and gamification design are significantly associated with self-reference, and in turn, positively associated with co-creation. It indicates that cognitive behavior plays the main role in forming co-creation. Participants are more drawn to co-creation behaviors by the marketing contents that prompt reactive behaviors than proactive ones. Therefore, marketing managers can use appropriate stimuli to enhance co-creation behavior. Companies can design activities related to users, and more accessible for reactive, instead of proactive behavior, i.e., asking for their initiatives. It also suggests that companies' marketing campaigns should involve key opinion leaders matching the product image and the target audience's preferences.

The main aim is to understand the active role of volunteers in internal branding that is in the co-creation of value. A subsidiary aim is to understand why some volunteers engage deeply and seriously in a nonprofit organization while other volunteers seem less connected? Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual framework incorporates several motivators to volunteer-led co-creation. A quantitative, co-variance-based structural equation modelling approach is used on survey data of a sample of 357 volunteers from 14 organizations in the Australian nonprofit sector. Findings - The research findings contribute to the newly emerging internal branding literature focusing on the active co-creation role of internal stakeholders. The main drivers of volunteer co-creation are volunteer engagement, commitment, altruism, values-congruency and brand reputation. Different explanatory mechanisms/motivators apply to each type of volunteer-led co-creation. In a major initiative, the paper demonstrates linkages across the different types of co-creation, with a foundation/pivotal role for one particular type of co-creation, namely, enhanced client-based solutions. Research limitations/implications - The research is restricted to the public sector and further research is needed to test applicability to the private sector. Future studies could continue the initiative in the current study to explore the linkages across co-creation types. Practical implications - Implications depend on which type of co-creation is targeted. Enhancing client-based solutions co-creation requires a very strong role for engaged volunteers. Innovation co-creation requires both engaged volunteers and a propensity to co-create by enhancing client-based solutions. Brand advocacy co-creation is driven by volunteer commitment, altruism and a propensity to co-create innovation. Social implications - A non-profit context ensures major social implications. Originality/value - The study operationalizes the Saleem and Iglesias (2016) new internal branding paradigm framework by demonstrating that brands are built organically by interacting and engaging with internal stakeholders (volunteers in this instance), which, in turn, inter alia, motivates co-creation by such internal stakeholders.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JPBM-03-2020-2784,WOS,Journal

One such approach for compliance analysis is presented in this article for a mechanism designed at Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. To validate the analytical models, finite element analysis simulations are performed with the help of the Abaqus-6.14 software package.

A salient difference are the closed loops between action and perception prominently present in natural but not laboratory behaviors. The framework of reinforcement learning and control naturally wades across action and perception, and thus is poised to inform the neurosciences of tomorrow, not only from a data analyses and modeling framework, but also in guiding experimental design. We argue that this theoretical framework emphasizes active sensing, dynamical planning, and the leveraging of structural regularities as key operations for intelligent behavior within uncertain, time-varying environments. Similarly, we argue that we may study natural task strategies and their neural circuits without over-training animals when the tasks we use tap into our animal?s structural knowledge. As proof-of-principle, we teach animals to navigate through a virtual environment ? i.e., explore a well-defined and repetitive structure governed by the laws of physics - using a joystick. Once these animals have learned to ?drive?, without further training they naturally (i) show zero- or oneshot learning of novel sensorimotor contingencies, (ii) infer the evolving path of dynamically changing latent variables, and (iii) make decisions consistent with maximizing reward rate. Such task designs allow for the study of flexible and generalizable, yet controlled, behaviors. In turn, they allow for the exploitation of pillars of intelligence ? flexibility, prediction, and generalization ?, properties whose neural underpinning have remained elusive.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pneurobio.2021.101996,WOS,Journal

Identifying these adaptive genetic variabilities is crucial not only to improve our knowledge of the genetic mechanism of local adaptation but also to explore the adaptation potential of species. Results: Using 10 natural populations and 12 start codon targeted (SCoT) markers, a total of 430 unambiguous loci were yielded. The Bayesian analysis of population structure clearly demonstrated that the 10 populations of P. bungeana could be subdivided into three groups. Redundancy analysis showed that this genetic divergence was caused by divergence selection from environmental variables related to the ecological habitats of ""avoidance of flooding"" and ""avoidance of high temperature and humidity."" LFMM results indicated that Bio1, Bio5, Bio8, Bio12, Bio14, and Bio16, which are related to the ecological habitat of P. bungeana, were correlated with the highest numbers of environment-associated loci (EAL). Conclusions: The results of EAL characterization in P. bungeana clearly supported the hypothesis that environmental variations related to the ecological habitat of species are the key drivers of species adaptive divergence. Moreover, a method to calculate the species landscape adaptation index and quantify the adaptation potential of species was proposed and verified using ecological niche modeling. This model could estimate climatically suitable areas of species spatial distribution. Taking the results together, this study improves the current understanding on the genetic basis of local adaptation.

As the world of work changes, so too do the skills that workers need. In a world of thinking machines, humans must possess the ability to understand and take advantage of AI, as well as maintain their ability to compete for jobs against a talent pool of both human and robotic candidates. Therefore, individuals must be able to keep up with changes in emerging tech, make effective use of the tools of modern technology, and identify and develop skills that technology cannot replace. In this context, educators face the challenge of preparing today's students for the new world of work; enabling students to navigate their way through shifting opportunities and make decisions about what seem to be increasingly uncertain employment prospects. A number of studies have focused on predictions about job losses as robots replace human workers [1]. However, fewer research studies have investigated the perceptions and feelings of affected individuals, and their plans to navigate a future increasingly shared with technology. The aim of our research is to explore student's attitudes, perceptions and reported behaviours regarding the impact of AI on the world of work and education. The present research provides a detailed understanding of a specific set of individuals: the current generation of undergraduate students. This group of students are on the cusp of entering the workforce, they are the first generation for whom automation will definitely impact on their working lives, yet they have been educated in a system which is only just beginning to wake up to the implications of automation for the workforce. Many students are themselves not fully aware of what the future will hold. This research explores these students' visions of their futures; their awareness of how technological development may affect them; their hopes and fears; how they plan to prepare themselves for the coming changes, and; their attitudes to the impact of AI on the world of work and education. Qualitative and quantitative data will be presented from surveys, discussion groups, written work and interviews. Participants include both a general undergraduate student population studying in the UK and US (n=356), and a specific group of undergraduate students studying a Robotics, Business and Society course in the UK (n=53). The findings from this research will provide guidance for educators looking to understand and best prepare today's students for the workplace of tomorrow. Specifically, this paper explores students' thoughts and feelings about their education, work choices and the skills they feel they will need to equip themselves for this brave new world. Key findings are described using the following themes: what kinds of future students envisage in an increasingly automated work environment; how students imagine themselves in these futures; how students plan to actively respond; and what advice they have for younger students and for educators. The results and discussion focus on how to prepare students for increasing automation as well as the new challenges that AI presents for higher education more broadly.",2019,,WOS,Conference Paper

(2022),Designing agroecological systems across scales: a new analytical framework,AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,,10.1007/s13593-021-00741-9,"Researchers worldwide are expected to design and develop agroecological systems to address major challenges such as increasing biotic pressure and climate change. But to design effective innovations, researchers should integrate new cropping techniques into wider agricultural systems such as cropping systems, innovative farms, alternative food systems, or multifunctional landscapes. This integration requires a long process of exploration in which the object under design can transform and shift to a different organisational scale. In this article, we wish to introduce a new analytical framework highlighting the systemic mechanisms involved in the scale transformations of design objects along agroecological design processes. We conceptualise an agroecological design process as a non-linear unpredictable process in which four components-a science consortium, non-scientific actors in the field, a problem situation and a design object-interact, and co-evolve through time. The scale transformations of the design objects and their drivers are the results of interactions and knowledge flows between these four components. This analytical framework was tested and further elaborated through ex-post analysis of design processes in three contrasting case studies in the context of tropical horticulture. Data were collected through literature review, interviews, and focus group discussions with the researchers involved in the three design processes. Future design methods should take full account of the lengthy, non-linear, and transformational nature of agroecological design processes and the coexistence of different types of knowledge-holistic vs. reductionist, ecosystem focused vs. human-system focused-which can interconnect and nourish each other.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13593-021-00741-9,WOS,Journal

The intersection between ODL and learning analytics embodies a unique combination of factors through which theoretically informed approaches can reveal insights about and catalyze changes to curricula and pedagogy. Using learning analytics to change practices within a particular context requires attending to the assumptions and values for teaching, learning, and knowing. In addition to prioritizing human-centered decision making with data, a situative approach prioritizes revealing the assumptions embedded within the design decisions of ODL environments. Focusing on individual studentsâ€™ participation in ODL environments can illuminate design issues and reveal opportunities to change existing teaching and learning activities. The authors argues that the emphasis on smaller scale data analyses provides information relevant for identifying larger scale applications that can be constructed from explorations of more localized teaching and learning contexts. This chapter provides an emerging example to address the growing need for expanding learning analytics research as a process of joint collaboration between all members of an online learning community.

Design/methodology/approach A large-scale questionnaire survey was carried out among the firms in three high-tech parks of the Pearl River Delta, with a total of 287 firms as empirical samples. Hypotheses are tested using ordinary least squares analyzes on hierarchical multiple regression to find out how geographic search can drive business model innovation generations. Findings The empirical results showed that the more frequent geographic search is, the more favorable it is for firms to generate innovative business models, and firms may be more effective in geographic searching and business model innovation with better governmental networking. However, the above relationship may be weakened if the environment turbulence in emerging markets is further considered. It was argued that firms must take into account both the positive effects of governmental networking and the negative effects of environmental turbulence in conducting a geographic search for external knowledge resources to generate innovative business models. The study results showed how and why governmental networking can be a key catalyst for firms to generate innovative business models. Research limitations/implications This study contributes to the business model innovation literature by documenting the large-scale survey evidence that confirms the practicality of geographic search in the business model innovation generations. The findings advance previous studies in the business model innovation by identifying the moderating roles of governmental network and environment turbulence that predict business model innovation behaviors in the emerging market. Practical implications The results indicate that the geographic search can be easily operationalized for external resources acquisitions by managers in generating business model innovation. This has applications for external resource acquisitions on the basis of business model innovation in the emerging China market. In addition, to facilitate the business model innovation generations, the focus should be on critical contingency factors; on the one hand, to promote the continued use of external resources, the focus should be on enhancing benefits such as governmental networking. Originality/value The findings extend existing theory in three ways as the original value. First, the results show that geographic search is an important driver of business model innovation generations in an emerging market context. Second, this study is the first to take organizational learning and open innovation perspective to examine geographic search as a boundary-spanning search of external resources in business model innovation generations. Third, this study also explores the moderator role of governmental network and environmental turbulence on how to strengthen or impair the geographic search and business model innovation generations.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JKM-06-2020-0484,WOS,Journal

In addition, the study aims to explore the mediating role of green innovation in the impact of business analytics and environmental orientation on green competitive advantage. Design/methodology/approach Based upon the theoretical analysis of existing literature, several hypotheses have been developed. Data was gathered using a survey method. The survey was conducted using online portal, 388 valid responses have been processed using SPSS 23.0 and AMOS 23.0 for empirical analysis. Two steps were used, first reliability and validity have been measured. Following this, the authors employed structural equation modeling technique to test hypothetical relationships. Findings The results from the authors' empirical analysis indicate that business analytics and environmental orientation have a pivotal role toward green innovation as well as green competitive advantage. If the results are seen comparatively, then it can be indicated that the role of business analytics is more powerful compared with the environmental orientation. Although environmental orientation is a key factor of green innovation, but its direct role toward green competitive advantage is not so strong. Similarly, to check the other mechanisms, the role of green innovation as a mediator was explored. Empirical findings have established the mediating role of green innovation in the influence of business analytics and environmental orientation on green competitive advantage. Thus, the results confirm a mechanism of green innovation in the impact of business analytics and environmental orientation on green competitive advantage. Practical implications The study captures the attention of decision-makers and highlights that business leaders need to emphasize on business analytics while making managerial decisions related to green innovation and green competitive advantage.

Method: an exploratory survey with a qualitative approach and a narrative method was carried out. Results: the data collected shows that the company does have a strategy to build and consolidate an emotional relationship with its users. This emotional connection can be perceived in studentsâ€™ narratives, mainly when they came from public schools. Results also brought evidence that traditional education methods can be threatened by EdTech, mainly in environments where regulatory controls are weak.

The unique features of Smart PSS including smartness and connectedness, value co-creation and data-driven design manner, enable the collection and analysis of large volume and heterogeneous contextual data to extract useful knowledge. Therefore, requirement elicitation, as a critical process for new solution (i.e. product-service) design, can be conducted in a rather context-aware manner, assured by those massive user-generated data and product-sensed data during the usage stage. Nevertheless, despite a few works on semantic modelling, scarcely any reports on such mechanism in today's smart, connected environment. Aiming to fill this gap, for the first time, a graph-based context-aware requirement elicitation approach considering contextual information within the Smart PSS is proposed. It leverages the pre-defined product, service, and condition ontologies together with Deepwalk technique, to formulate those concepts as nodes and their relationships as the edge of the proposed requirement graph. Implicit stakeholder requirements within a specific context can be further derived based on such interrelationships in a data-driven manner. To demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness, an example of smart bike share system is addressed to illustrate the requirement elicitation process.

Increasingly, sensory data techniques are moving towards more dynamic aspects of sensory perception, taking account of the various stages of user-product interactions. Recent technological advancements in virtual reality and augmented reality have unlocked the potential for new immersive and interactive systems which could be applied as powerful tools for capturing and deciphering the complexities of human sensory perception. This paper reviews recent advancements in virtual and augmented reality technologies and identifies and explores their potential application within the field of sensory science. The paper also considers the possible benefits for the food industry as well as key challenges posed for widespread adoption. The findings indicate that these technologies have the potential to alter the research landscape in sensory science by facilitating promising innovations in five principal areas: consumption context, biometrics, food structure and texture, sensory marketing and augmenting sensory perception. Although the advent of augmented and virtual reality in sensory science offers new exciting developments, the exploitation of these technologies is in its infancy and future research will understand how they can be fully integrated with food and human responses.

At the same time, with the continuous rise of China's manufacturing value chain, the impact of the manufacturing value chain on energy conservation and emission reduction is a very necessary and key research. This paper theoretically analyzes the impact of value chain climbing in manufacturing industry on energy conservation and emission reduction, and empirically tests the relationship between the two. This paper further explores the transmission mechanism between the two, and analyzes the hierarchical heterogeneity of the manufacturing industry. It is found that the ascent of manufacturing value chain has a significant promoting effect on energy conservation and emission reduction. In this conduction path, the innovation-driven effect and the structural upgrading effect play a positive role in promoting. Among them, the innovation-driven effect is more powerful and effective in promoting energy conservation and emission reduction. Further analysis shows that in this path, different industries have asymmetric effects on energy saving and emission reduction. Energy-intensive industries have huge potential for energy conservation and emission reduction. In the process of upgrading, technology-intensive industries have a more significant effect of energy conservation and emission reduction, which enables energy conservation, emission reduction, quality and efficiency improvement. In this paper, the policy system of energy saving and emission reduction should be carried out simultaneously. More importantly, it should be detailed by manufacturing industry category.

The selected site is located in Mornington, Dunedin, which is the currently neglected historic former Mornington Cable-Car Depot. As a general methodology for analysing the site condition a systematic study of: architectural, historical, and urban analysis was conducted to provide insight into which approach for the adaptive reuse was appropriate. Additional applied research methods in this project include: field trips, examination of relevant literature and precedents, and studying different designs concepts through drawings and 3D model making. The final design proposes Alternative Representation as a new and experimental approach to heritage. The final approach was used as a mechanism for the historic building to maintain its integrity, while enhancing the functionality of the building and revealing selected portions of the architectural cultural heritage. Therefore, the architecture creates a reminder to the contemporary city of their heritage, while the building fulfils its original function as a cable-car depot; with the end objective to stimulate change in the treatment of heritage fabric in the urban landscape of New Zealand.

The proliferation of UMI technologies will not only change the way we live but can also offer new learning opportunities. At the same time, there is an increasing need for skills that are associated with the UMI domain in the labour market. The Umi-Sci-Ed is an EU project which explores ways to shed new light into this training aspect by introducing several model educational scenarios that incorporate UMI technologies, in order to cultivate relevant competences on high school students. This paper reports initial results achieved in this context. In particular, we give an overview of the key components of the UMI-Sci-Ed platform that aims to support the activities of Communities of Practice involved in STEM education. Students through a mentoring mechanism are provided with training material, IoT hardware kits and software tools to explore UMI technologies through hands-on activities. In this framework, example educational scenarios and the corresponding UMI applications developed are presented. The hypothesis is that the learning process can be empowered by using such UMI applications as students are provided with meaningful opportunities to participate in the learning process such as in terms of building applications that are relevant to the subject they like and having active interactions within student groups in a way that practical experiences can provide them a rich context to grasp scientific knowledge. Finally, the results of a preliminary evaluation of the proposed approach in the context of an educational workshop are discussed.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.5220/0006686200780090,WOS,Conference Paper

While leading mathematics education organizations have identified the specialized knowledge and skills required for EMS positions, how to best prepare these individuals is knowledge that the field is still exploring. This paper first presents a theoretical model for EMS preparation that aligns an emerging coaching tool, the Decision-Making Protocol for Mathematics Coaching (Baker & Knapp, 2019, [DMPMC]) with the Professional Development Design Framework (Loucks-Horsley et al. in Designing professional development for teachers of science and mathematics, Corwin Press, 2010). The paper then presents a descriptive case study that examines the application of this model in an EMS preparation course. The findings indicate that assessing the coaching situation fostered administrative partnerships, revisiting goals increased specificity of anticipated outcomes, and applying research-informed practices increased EMS self-efficacy and advanced coaching agendas. Taken together, these findings suggest that integrating the DMPMC into an EMS preparation course led to positive changes in EMS candidate learning of professional development design. Notably, this is one of the first studies that documents the influence of a coaching education tool on EMS candidates' professional development design.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10857-021-09507-2,WOS,Journal

(2016),A new variance-based approach for discriminative feature extraction in machine hearing classification using spectrogram features,DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING,,10.1016/j.dsp.2016.04.005,"Machine hearing is an emerging research field that is analogous to machine vision in that it aims to equip computers with the ability to hear and recognise a variety of sounds. It is a key enabler of natural human-computer speech interfacing, as well as in areas such as automated security surveillance, environmental monitoring, smart homes/buildings/cities. Recent advances in machine learning allow current systems to accurately recognise a diverse range of sounds under controlled conditions. However doing so in real-world noisy conditions remains a challenging task. Several front-end feature extraction methods have been used for machine hearing, employing speech recognition features like MFCC and PLP, as well as image-like features such as AIM and SIF. The best choice of feature is found to be dependent upon the noise environment and machine learning techniques used. Machine learning methods such as deep neural networks have been shown capable of inferring discriminative classification rules from less structured front-end features in related domains. In the machine hearing field, spectrogram image features have recently shown good performance for noise-corrupted classification using deep neural networks. However there are many methods of extracting features from spectrograms. This paper explores a novel data-driven feature extraction method that uses variance-based criteria to define spectral pooling of features from spectrograms. The proposed method, based on maximising the pooled spectral variance of foreground and background sound models, is shown to achieve very good performance for robust classification.

The harnessing of women's potential is an urgent subject in this context, and successive initiatives have been flourishing in many countries. However, given the institutional complexity of the issue, as well as considerable variety across nations, uniformed non-systematic approaches are hardly satisfactory in achieving a timely solution. Against this back drop, this paper analyzed a new information communication technology (ICT)-driven disruptive innovation that may nurture un-captured GDP by harnessing untapped resources such as women's economic potential. Using a unique dataset representing the state of gender balance improvement, an empirical numerical analysis of 44 countries was attempted. These countries were classified as emerging, industrialized, and with a specific culture based particularly on the traditions of a male-dominated society. It was found that while industrialized countries, typically Finland, have achieved high performance in co-evolution between â€œecono-cultural development,â€ ICT advancement, and gender balance improvement, emerging countries have been constrained by low ICT advancement. In addition, notwithstanding their high economic level, countries with a specific culture have been constrained by a traditional male-dominated culture, Japan being a typical case. Based on these findings, lessons from industrialized countries for both emerging countries and countries with a specific culture were analyzed. It was suggested that ICT should be strategically advanced depending on the state of what we are calling â€œecono-cultural developmentâ€ for constructing co-evolution of gender balance improvement along with techno-economic development. A new practical approach for harnessing untapped resources for sustainable growth was thus explored.

Design/methodology/approach In this study, the variable of managerial entrenchment, which includes the variables of management independence, dual role of management, management tenure, the board compensation and the board ownership percentage, was initially estimated through the exploratory factor analysis and its effect was evaluated on the dependent variables of the study using the test of multivariable regressions. Hence, a total of 103 listed companies on the Tehran Stock Exchange were selected and analyzed during 2011-2016. In this paper, the Jones model is used as the variable of accrued earnings management and for calculating the real earnings management, the models of abnormal operational cash flows, abnormal production costs and abnormal optional costs are employed. Moreover, the research and development cost to total costs ratio is used for calculating the innovation. Findings The results indicate a negative and significant relationship between managerial entrenchment and accrual-based earnings management; moreover, the entrenched managers are less likely to engage in manipulating the real activities accruals in Iran context. Furthermore, the findings show that there is a positive and significant relationship between managerial entrenchment and firm innovation. Originality/value What really sets this paper apart from other studies is that this research will make aware investors and stakeholders of this fact that managerial entrenchment will be a good way to diminish the manipulation of financial reporting and improve the corporate situation in emerging markets, particularly those bazaars facing with economic sanctions such as Iran.

(2021),Automated and Autonomous Experiments in Electron and Scanning Probe Microscopy,ACS NANO,,10.1021/acsnano.1c02104,"Machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI) are rapidly becoming an indispensable part of physics research, with domain applications ranging from theory and materials prediction to high-throughput data analysis. In parallel, the recent successes in applying ML/AI methods for autonomous systems from robotics to self-driving cars to organic and inorganic synthesis are generating enthusiasm for the potential of these techniques to enable automated and autonomous experiments (AE) in imaging. Here, we aim to analyze the major pathways toward AE in imaging methods with sequential image formation mechanisms, focusing on scanning probe microscopy (SPM) and (scanning) transmission electron microscopy ((S)TEM). We argue that automated experiments should necessarily be discussed in a broader context of the general domain knowledge that both informs the experiment and is increased as the result of the experiment. As such, this analysis should explore the human and ML/AI roles prior to and during the experiment and consider the latencies, biases, and prior knowledge of the decision-making process. Similarly, such discussion should include the limitations of the existing imaging systems, including intrinsic latencies, non-idealities, and drifts comprising both correctable and stochastic components. We further pose that the role of the AE in microscopy is not the exclusion of human operators (as is the case for autonomous driving), but rather automation of routine operations such as microscope tuning, etc., prior to the experiment, and conversion of low latency decision making processes on the time scale spanning from image acquisition to human-level high-order experiment planning. Overall, we argue that ML/AI can dramatically alter the (S)TEM and SPM fields; however, this process is likely to be highly nontrivial and initiated by combined human-ML workflows and will bring challenges both from the microscope and ML/AI sides. At the same time, these methods will enable opportunities and paradigms for scientific discovery and nanostructure fabrication.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.1c02104,WOS,Journal

Local communities have been living with and developing water-responsive infrastructures for generations that engage and support the complex ecosystems they inhabit. Many of these innovations improve coastal resiliency, yet remain undocumented and unexplored in the evolution of contemporary solutions. Rooted in traditional ecological knowledge, or TEK, these technologies work symbiotically with, rather than against nature, and offer examples of a more comprehensive approach to underwater and intertidal design. These innovations are Loâ€”TEK, a term coined by designer and author Julia Watson, that is defined as resilient infrastructures developed by indigenous people through Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) (Watson 2019). The movement to bring these innovations to the forefront of the design field counters the idea that Loâ€”TEK indigenous innovation is low-tech, a term often incorrectly applied to indigenous innovation that means unsophisticated, uncomplicated, and primitive. In actuality, Loâ€”TEK aligns to todayâ€™s sustainable values of low-energy, low-impact and low-cost, while producing complex nature-based innovations that are inherently sustainable. Lo-TEK expands the definition of contemporary technology by rebuilding our understanding of climate resilient design using indigenous knowledge and practices that are sustainable, adaptable, and borne out of necessity. Indigenous people have learned to live symbiotically with their environments, especially water. This essay will explore the Kuttanad Kayalnilam Farming System by the Malayalis in India, the Sangjiyutang Mulberry Dyke and Fish Ponds in China, and the Ramli Lagoon farms in Ghar El Melh, Tunisia. These innovations are inherently resilient to the stresses of the climate and are multi-functional, symbiotic structures themselves. While not directly intended for protection from the new challenge of sea level rise, they can inform how we can build circular water systems that work with the environment, rather than disrupting it.

It brings the focus to a network's biochemical phenotypes and their relationship with measurable traits (e.g., product yields, system dynamics, signal amplification factors, etc.) and away from computationally intensive simulation-centric modeling. Here, we explore applications of this new modeling strategy in the field of rational metabolic engineering using the amorphadiene biosynthetic network as a case study. This network has previously been studied using a mechanistic model and the simulation-centric strategy, and thus provides an excellent means to compare and contrast results obtained from these two very different strategies. We show that the phenotype-centric strategy, without values for the parameters, not only identifies beneficial intervention strategies obtained with the simulation-centric strategy, but it also provides an understanding of the mechanistic context for the validity of these predictions. Additionally, we propose a set of hypothetical strains with the potential to outperform reported production strains and to enhance the mechanistic understanding of the amorphadiene biosynthetic network. Further, we identify the landscape of possible intervention strategies for the given model. We believe that phenotype-centric modeling can advance the field of rational metabolic engineering by enabling the development of next generation kinetics-based algorithms and methods that do not rely on a priori knowledge of kinetic parameters but allow a structured, global analysis of system design in the parameter space.

This study aims to justify the transformation of the educational environment of APE in the context of digitalization and to consider the prospects for targeted professional development of teachers in the republic according to their needs. The authors chose this scientific topic due to the pressing needs of Russian continuing professional education (CPE) and current problems such as the lack of unified approaches and mechanisms for regulating the professional development of teachers in the digital educational environment and the lack of methods for monitoring the effectiveness and efficiency of CPE distance learning programs. Creating an innovative and dynamic CPE system requires the intensive introduction of information technologies into education. These technologies ensure that the learning process is open and of high quality, as well as provide access to global educational resources. This helps learners create their own individual educational environment reflecting their needs and requirements. The research methods used to explore this problem were a pedagogical experiment, the analysis of the organization of CPE of teachers in the region, designing a regional model of targeted personalized training of educators and administration. The research results include the specifics of APE modernization in the region and the model of targeted personalized training of teachers of the republic. The qualitative novelty of this model stems from the fact that developing teachers' competencies involves identifying gaps in their professional knowledge and building individual learning paths.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.20511/pyr2020.v8nSPE3.699,WOS,Journal

An emerging challenge in intelligent materials design is hand gesture recognition textiles. Most current research focuses on number gesture recognition via smart gloves, so there is a gap in research that studies contact-less number gesture recognition textiles via computer vision. Meanwhile, there is lack of exploration on the integration of illuminating function and number gesture recognition textiles to improve interactivity by real-time visualizing detection results. In this research, a novel interactive illuminating textile with a touch-less number gesture recognition function has been designed and fabricated by using an open-source AI model. It is used in sync with a polymeric optical fiber textile with illuminative features. The textile is color-changing, controlled by the system's mid-air interactive number gesture recognition capability and has a woven stripe pattern and a double-layer weave structure with open pockets to facilitate integration of the system's components. Also described here is a novel design process that permits textile design and intelligent technology to integrate seamlessly and in synchronization, so that design in effect mediates continuously between the physical textile and the intangible technology.

Consequently, a deep understanding of its emission patterns and the corresponding driving factors are of great importance for exploring the untapped potential of household. However, how to accurately capture household emission features still demand further support from both data and method development. To bridge this knowledge gap, we try to use machine learning technology, which is well linked to the micro-level household survey data, to identify key determinants that could explain the household home-energy consumption and associated emissions. Here, we investigate the household CO2 emissions based on a representative survey which covers 31,133 households in Japan. Six types of machine learning process are employed to find key factors determining to different household emission patterns. Results show that demographic structure, average age and electricity-intensive appliances (electric water heaters, electric heaters, etc.) are most significant driving factors that explain differences in household emissions. Results also further verified that differences in driving factors can be observed in identifying various household emission patterns.

Meanwhile, the socio-economic morphology and spatial pattern in the rural areas are undergoing dramatic restructuring. This paper takes the Huangshandian village in the suburb of Beijing as a case study area to carry out an empirical study on the process of rural restructuring by adopting the method of participatory rural assessment (PRA) and GIS technology. The results show that since 2000, the Huangshandian village has experienced different industrial transformations from traditional agriculture to the industries of primary processing and eco-tourism. The function of traditional agricultural production is declining gradually, and the industrial production, ecological culture and other multi-functional value of the rural territory have successively appeared. With the evolution and restructuring of socio-economic morphology, there are significant changes in the quantity, structure, and pattern of rural living, production and ecological space accordingly. The mutually reinforced and restrictive relationships among economic restructuring, spatial restructuring, and social restructuring have jointly driven the systematic development of the natural-ecological-economic-social systems and the comprehensive promotion of the production-living-ecology-culture functions. Based on the analysis of the process of rural restructuring of the Huangshandian village in the aspects of economic restructuring, spatial restructuring, and social restructuring, this paper puts forward some suggestions on land use policy and institutional innovations aiming at optimally allocating the land resources and promoting the rural restructuring in metropolitan suburbs, including accelerating the institutional framework design of rural land transfer, exploring the tourism land management system adapting to the new pattern of rural economy and pushing forward the re-use mechanism of abandoned industrial and mining land.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2017.12.001,WOS,Journal

Further, gaps related to knowledge sharing influence on firms' competitiveness from an emerging economy perspective was a major driver of this study. Background: The relevance of knowledge sharing is today crucial for firms that seek to harness internal resource innovation towards ensuring increased competitiveness. The link between the actions of leaders and outcomes from sharing knowledge towards increased competitiveness would further advance theory on knowledge sharing and provide managerial implication that is instrumental for an improved organisational outcome. Methodology: The study sample was 282 participants and Partial least square structural equation model was used for the analysis of the data obtained through a questionnaire survey with the aid of SmartPLSv3.9. Contribution: The study contributes to knowledge management literature through advancing leadership as a mediating factor that accounts for the link between knowledge sharing and firms' competitiveness, most especially from an emerging economy perspective. Findings: Knowledge sharing was found to have a positive effect on firms' competitiveness. The study found that leadership behaviour mediates the relationship between knowledge sharing and a firm's competitiveness. Recommendations for Practitioners: The study recommends that, when supported with the right attitude from leaders in the organisation, knowledge sharing will be beneficial towards the firm gaining competitiveness most especially. Future Research: Future studies should be carried out in other sectors aside from the manufacturing sector using the same measures used to measure knowledge sharing. Also, a comparative analysis of knowledge sharing and firms' competitiveness using leaders' behaviour as a mediator should be researched in other developing economies.

As the starting point of the Silk Road, Xi 'an is also an international cultural metropolis that is further building and promoting economic prosperity and development. This special location has entrusted its unusual historical task. As the campus of Xi 'an Jiaotong University, the scientific and Technological Innovation Port in western China, located in Xi 'an, needs the rendering and influence of Silk Road culture. Therefore, in order to make teachers and students consciously inherit and appreciate the Silk Road culture, it is of great significance to make the diversity of the Silk Road culture reflect on the campus and create a unique campus landscape. The paper is divided into five chapters. Firstly, it summarises the development of Silk Road culture from different dimensions such as era, level and region, extracts different categories of elements, summarises them with the analysis of the research of Suzhou Silk Museum, and discusses how to apply these elements to campus landscape design. Take the landscape of the green space in the east part of the Innovation Port as a design sample, combine with the field investigation and analysis, further outline the shape, path, colour, material and plant elements, follow the principles and principles of campus landscape design, enumerate the plant elements with data, explore new application methods, define the design concept with characteristics, from the road, culture and ecological landscape configuration, characteristic silk road culture elements in the whole site. In this way, the Silk Road culture can be inherited, history can embrace the future, and a distinctive campus landscape can be created that adapts to the new trends of the times.

Knowledge transfer performance is a key consideration in the process of R&D collaboration between companies and research institutes; how to improve the performance of knowledge transfer depends on the matching between the partners of IUR collaboration. This article seeks to explore the influence mechanism of partner differences in the industry-university-research institute collaboration on the performance of knowledge transfer from the perspective of enterprises. Specifically, the study explores the moderating effect of technical knowledge difference and goal difference on the relationship between absorptive capacity, learning willingness, and knowledge transfer performance. The study applied the partial least squares structural equation modeling approach to model these relationships, based on survey data gathered from 211 Chinese firms. The results show that the goal difference of industry-university-research institute collaboration partners has a negative moderating effect on the relationship between learning willingness, absorptive capacity, and knowledge transfer performance. The greater the degree of goal difference, the lower the role of the enterprise's learning willingness and absorptive capacity to promote knowledge transfer performance. Technical knowledge difference has a significant inverted U-shaped effect on the relationship between absorptive capacity and knowledge transfer performance: a high degree of technical knowledge difference weakens the effects of absorptive capacity on knowledge transfer performance, while a low degree of technical knowledge difference will also negatively moderate the effects of absorptive capacity on knowledge transfer performance.

Startup teams are integrated or internal projects teams are provided with office space, independence and resources. Corporate incubators have become a promising solution for companies that aim at achieving structural ambidexterity, i.e. organizational ambidexterity that is embedded in corporate structure. While the current business practice shows that many different configurations of corporate incubators exist, the underlying requirements remain unclear. This paper therefore addresses the research gap by deriving a model describing the requirements for the organizational structure of corporate incubators. The authors draw from organization theory in order to derive requirement dimensions. Then, current literature on ambidexterity research is used to infer requirement parameters for each requirement dimension. From a practitioner's perspective, the developed model allows a systematic planning process that helps achieving a consistent configuration of corporate incubators, which reduces failure rates. From an academic perspective, the proposed model elaborates on the organizational requirements that underlie structural ambidexterity strategies.",2018,,WOS,Conference Paper

Somewhat surprisingly, comparison across studies of the mean- or median-reported area under the curve ratio showed appreciable variability in the magnitude of outcome. This commentary explores the possible drivers of this range of outcomes observed in clinical induction studies. While recommendations on clinical study design are not being proposed, some key observations were informative during the aggregate analysis of clinical data. Although DDI data are often presented using median data, individual data would enable evaluation of how differences in study design, baseline expression, and the number of subjects contribute. Since variability in perpetrator pharmacokinetics (PK) could impact the overall DDI interpretation, should this be routinely captured? Maximal induction was typically observed after 5-7 days of dosing. Thus, when the half-life of the inducer is less than 30 hours, are there benefits to a more standardized study design? A large proportion of CYP3A4 inducers were also CYP3A4 inhibitors and/or inactivators based on in vitro data. In these cases, using CYP3A selective substrates has limitations. More intensive monitoring of changes in area under the curve over time is warranted. With selective CYP3A substrates, the net effect was often inhibition, whereas less selective substrates could discern induction through mechanisms not susceptible to inhibition. The latter included oral contraceptives, which raise concerns of reduced efficacy following induction. Alternative approaches for modeling induction, such as applying biomarkers and physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling (PBPK), are also considered. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The goal of this commentary is to stimulate discussion on whether there are opportunities to optimize clinical drug-drug interaction study design. The overall aim is to reduce, understand and contextualize the variability observed in the magnitude of induction across reported clinical studies. A large clinical CYP3A induction dataset was collected and further analyzed to identify trends and gaps. Reporting individual victim PK data, characterizing perpetrator PK and including additional PK assessments for mixed-mechanism perpetrators may provide insights into how these factors impact differences observed in clinical outcomes. The potential utility of biomarkers and PBPK modeling are discussed in considering future directions.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1124/dmd.119.087270,WOS,Journal

This sector is facing multiple sustainability-related transformation pressures, forcing the industry to adapt to changing market conditions. The transition to a low-carbon economy will require oil refineries to adopt decarbonisation technologies like advanced biofuels, green hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS). However, the development and implementation of these technologies is not a straightforward process and may be inhibited by lock-in and path dependency. This paper draws on expert interviews and combines the Technological Innovation Systems (TIS) and Multi-level Perspective (MLP) frameworks to examining the niche level development of three emerging technologies in the context of deep decarbonisation of refinery. This research finds that the development of the three decarbonisation technologies shares some of the challenges and opportunities and exhibits technology interdependency to some extent. Among the three TISs, advanced biofuel is the most mature in terms of knowledge base, actor-network, legislation framework and market function. Green hydrogen and CCS encounter stronger momentum than before and can benefit from possible synergies across various sectors. However, the analysis also reveals the lack of market formation, mainly due to the lack of policy instruments for niche markets. Here, policy recommendations for accelerating deep decarbonisation of the oil refinery industry are discussed. Finally, we contribute to the sustainability transitions literature by exploring the dynamics of emerging TISs for industrial decarbonisation.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2021.102358,WOS,Journal

AMPs are present naturally in many organisms, from bacteria to humans, a time-tested mechanism that makes them attractive as effective antibiotics. Depending on the environment, AMPs can exhibit alpha-helical or beta-sheet conformations, a mix of both, or lack secondary structure; they can be linear or cyclic. Prediction of their structures is challenging but critical for rational design. Promising AMP leads can be developed using essentially two approaches: traditional modeling of the physicochemical mechanisms that determine peptide behavior in aqueous and membrane environments and knowledge-based, e.g., machine learning (ML) techniques, that exploit ever-growing AMP databases. Here, we explore the conformational landscapes of two recently ML-designed AMPs, characterize the dependence of these landscapes on the medium conditions, and identify features in peptide and membrane landscapes that mediate protein-membrane association. For both peptides, we observe greater conformational diversity in an aqueous solvent than in a less polar solvent, and one peptide is seen to alter its conformation more dramatically than the other upon the change of solvent. Our results support the view that structural rearrangement in response to environmental changes is central to the mechanism of membrane-structure disruption by linear peptides. We expect that the design of AMPs by ML will benefit from the incorporation of peptide conformational substates as quantified here with molecular simulations.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10867-022-09605-z,WOS,Journal

The historical assessments show the trajectories that have led to the current heavily regulated and developed social-ecological systems nested within a hierarchical governmental system. This chapter uses Panarchy theory as a general framework to evaluate the interactions between societal and ecological regime shifts and the governance regimes that mediate those interactions. The resilience assessments indicate that complex interactions among the governance and ecosystem components of these systems can produce different trajectories, which include patterns of (a) development and stabilization, (b) cycles of crisis and recovery which include lurches in adaptation and learning, and (c) periods of innovation, novelty, and transformation. Exploration of cross-scale interactions (Panarchy) among levels and sectors of government and society reveals that larger-scale processes and structures may constrain development and growth, but may also provide resources for recovery and renewal following crises or create windows or opportunities for system change. Smaller-scale processes provide opportunities for innovation and novelty, but may also be the source of revolts or crises that lead to broader system transformations. The case studies illustrate different ways that adaptive governance may be triggered, facilitated, or constrained by ecological and social (and particularly legal) processes.

However, few studies have addressed this issue in the context of emerging economies. To fill this research gap, this paper explores the TTSs and modes of Chinese NRIs based on a case study of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). We clarify the institutional factors that influence the adoption of an academy-branch-institute-level TTS, reveal the policy-driven evolvement of this multi-level TTS, and elucidate the operational mechanisms of the TTS. We find that the effective collaboration between the actors within or across the three levels of the TTS could enhance the functions of integration management, science and technology (S&T) resource allocation, and public research and development. Through a thematic synthesis approach, we identify three technology transfer modes of the CAS. These three modes exhibit an evolutionary sequence from the CAS-region cooperation mode to the incubation ecosystem mode and then to the platform-driven mode, following the progress of the Chinese S&T system reform and the repositioning of the CAS mission. These modes have diverse demands for technological cognition and resource allocation capability that can be satisfied by the co-specialised interaction among the three levels of the TTS. Apart from the theoretical implications for technology transfer studies, our findings provide managerial implications for guiding technology transfer from NRIs.

The integration of disparate interventions that are developed and implemented across various actors in healthcare value chains (VCs) remains a significant challenge. This calls for a multi-disciplinary approach to integrate the knowledge of communities, non-governmental organisations, private sector actors, frontline healthcare workers, and researchers in the development of sustainable, value-adding interventions. Multi-stakeholder engagement, in this article referred to as innovation platforms (IPs), is a mechanism through which interdependent VC actors could be organised and coordinated to develop sustainable innovations to strengthen the healthcare system. This article addresses the lack of guidance on how to develop and operate healthcare IPs in South Africa by presenting a framework for IP formation and functioning in healthcare VCs. A grounded theory approach, namely conceptual framework analysis, informed framework development within an exploratory qualitative study. The outcome of the study is an innovation management tool for improved policy development in a developing country context. It provides practical guidance to policy makers on how to: (1) Setup and develop an IP; (2) Implement interventions to improve IP functioning; and (3) Develop mechanisms to address commonly experienced challenges.

In doing so, it explores the role of knowledge acquisition and innovative work behavior (IWB) as possible mechanisms that underlie the relationship between performance-based rewards and radical innovation. The subsequent effect of IWB on promoting radical innovation is explored. The study employs data from 235 unit managers in manufacturing and technology firms in Jordan. Structural equation modeling was used to test for reliability, validity, and the hypothesized relationships. The results indicate that performance-based rewards positively affect knowledge acquisition. In addition, knowledge acquisition mediates the link between performance-based rewards and IWB. IWB is also significant and positive in promoting radical innovation. This paper is one of the first to examine how radical innovation can be promoted through IWB. It offers insights into and contributions to the literature on the role of performance-based rewards in driving radical innovation through the mediating effect of knowledge acquisition and the subsequent impact of IWB on radical innovation.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0219877022500055,WOS,Journal

A comprehensive model of organizational level IT innovation adoption is presented based on a context-mechanism-outcome perspective and by drawing on relevant theories. The proposed model is empirically tested using data from 1988 company executives across a wide range of organizations globally. A research model and the related hypotheses are tested using structural equation modelling. The study found that organizational level IT innovation readiness conceptualized through technology readiness and internal expertise is a key mediator for successful organizational level technology adoption. Other organizational factors such as top management support, organizational structure, and organization culture, were positively related to the overall level of IT innovation readiness and organizational level technology adoption. Considering that there are many organizational factors that influence the adoption of technology, future research should extend the research framework and include additional variables that could support IT innovation adoption outcomes. The study makes a significant contribution to the existing literature by providing empirical evidence related to the organizational factors necessary for a successful IT innovation adoption at an organizational level.(c) 2022 The Authors.

A widely held view is that large and well-connected social networks facilitate cumulative cultural evolution because they promote the spread of useful cultural traits and prevent the loss of cultural knowledge through factors such as drift. This view stems from models that focus on the transmission of cultural information, without considering how new cultural traits actually arise. In this paper, we review the literature from various fields that suggest that, under some circumstances, increased connectedness can decrease cultural diversity and reduce innovation rates. Incorporating this idea into an agent-based model, we explore the effect of population fragmentation on cumulative culture and show that, for a given population size, there exists an intermediate level of population fragmentation that maximizes the rate of cumulative cultural evolution. This result is explained by the fact that fully connected, non-fragmented populations are able to maintain complex cultural traits but produce insufficient variation and so lack the cultural diversity required to produce highly complex cultural traits. Conversely, highly fragmented populations produce a variety of cultural traits but cannot maintain complex ones. In populations with intermediate levels of fragmentation, cultural loss and cultural diversity are balanced in a way that maximizes cultural complexity. Our results suggest that population structure needs to be taken into account when investigating the relationship between demography and cumulative culture.

This shape-changing ability could be extremely helpful for rescue robots and those operating in unknown terrains and environments. In changing shape, soft materials also store and release elastic energy, a feature that can be exploited for effective robot movement. However, design and control of these moving soft robots are nontrivial. This paper presents design methodology for a 3-D printed motor-tendon actuated soft robot that is capable of locomotion. The modular design of the robot facilitates rapid fabrication, deployment, and repair. In addition to shape change, the robot uses friction-manipulation mechanisms to effect locomotion. The motor-tendon actuators are comprised of nylon tendons embedded inside the soft body structure along a given path with one end fixed on the body and the other attached to a motor. These actuators directly control the deformation of the soft body, which influences the robot locomotion behavior. Static stress analysis is used as a tool for designing the shape of the paths of these tendons embedded inside the body. This paper also presents a novel model-free learning-based control approach for soft robots, which interact with the environment at discrete contact points. This approach involves discretization of factors dominating robot-environment interactions as states, learning the results as robot transitions between these robot states, and evaluation of desired periodic state control sequences optimizing a cost function corresponding to a locomotion task (rotation or translation). The clever discretization allows the framework to exist in a robot's task space, hence facilitating calculation of control sequences without modeling the actuator, body material, or details of the friction mechanisms. The flexibility of the framework is experimentally explored by applying it to robots with different friction mechanisms and different shapes of tendon paths.

Mars-omics, planetary science, and the next-generation technology futurists",OMICS A Journal of Integrative Biology,Mars; Omics; planetary science; technology foresight,10.1089/omi.2018.0167,"Omics technologies are key to research and innovation in human health, food and nutrition, drugs, agriculture, and ecology research. Yet, the actual scope of applications is much broader. One emerging possibility is planetary science driven in part by current debates on and possibilities for travel to Mars. In July 2018, radar evidence has suggested the presence of subglacial liquid water in a 20-km-wide zone, likely a saltwater lake, in the Planum Australe region in the south pole of Mars. If confirmed, this will be a promising place to search for microbial life on the red planet. Meanwhile, existential threats to life on earth such as climate change are bolstering the current interests by spacefaring nations for manned long-term space travel to other planets. A new global space industry is also on the rise; Mars-related technology innovation could potentially allow for rapid Earth-to-Earth transport as well, for example, in times of humanitarian and ecological crisis. Against this overarching context, we coin and define here the new concept of ""Mars-omics"": the systems level study of how travel to and being on Mars affect human health, and how human presence on Mars impacts the life forms that might already be there, through changes such as space agriculture and other planetary transformations in Mars. Additionally, Mars-omics calls for new ways of thinking about scientific uncertainty and technology futures in such highly novel contexts. For example, how shall we frame scientific uncertainty when extrapolation of scientific unknowns across the planets is vastly difficult, nonlinear, and complex? Is uncertainty an accident or integral part of emerging technologies? These questions are important for achieving new relevance for and future progress in omics system science applications in planetary science and space explorations. In summary, this article suggests that omics has relevance in contexts beyond those on planet Earth. Moreover, past omics applications such as precision medicine may need to be reconceptualized in future novel settings, such as long-term space travel. We conclude the article with the key tenets of next-generation futurists in a context of Mars-omics. Space (still) is the final frontier for humans, medicine, engineering, and omics.

The development of ML methods, associated with the abundance of data and combined with fluid-dynamics knowledge, offers a unique opportunity for achieving significant breakthroughs in terms of advances in flow prediction and its control. The objective of this paper is to discuss some possibilities offered by ML algorithms for exploring and predicting flow-dynamical systems. First, an overview of basic concepts underpinning artificial neural networks, deep neural networks, and convolutional neural networks is given. Building upon this overview, the concept of Auto-Encoders (AEs) is introduced. An AE constitutes an unsupervised learning technique in which a neural-network architecture is leveraged for determining a data structure that results from reducing the dimensionality of the native system. For the particular test case of flow behind a cylinder, it is shown that combinations of an AE with other ML algorithms can be used (i) to provide a low-dimensional dynamical model (a probabilistic flow prediction), (ii) to give a deterministic flow prediction, and (iii) to retrieve high-resolution data in the spatio-temporal domain from contaminated and/or under-sampled data.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/5.0012906,WOS,Journal

However, the underlying mechanisms of technological learning and the unique catch-up context in large emerging economies are much less explored. To explain the technological learning processes of latecomers that face the technology gap and strive to build differentiated competitive advantage, this study builds on the absorptive capacity perspective and deconstructs technological learning processes into two mechanisms: technology decomposition and technology recombination. The former entails decomposing advanced technologies into pieces, parts, or modules, while the latter entails the process of capturing market opportunities through recombining knowledge from diverse sources into commercial products through localized innovations and adaptations. Then, we propose a unique 'ladder-like' catch-up context (i.e., technology ladder and market ladder) and investigate how the technological learning process and the unique catch-up context jointly affect industrial catch-up performance in China. Using seven-year panel data from Chinese manufacturing industries, the results indicate that only technology recombination has a significantly positive relationship with industrial catch-up performance. In addition, the market ladder strengthens the positive impact of technology recombination on industrial catch-up, while the technology ladder weakens the positive impact of technology decomposition on catch-up.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/mor.2021.7,WOS,Journal

Therefore, this study aims to test the association of marketing and financial metrics use and the metric-based orientations of training and compensation, with two key marketing routines â€“ exploitation, i.e. the perfecting of existing activities while allowing for incremental adaptations and exploration or experimentation accompanied by radical adaptation. Design/methodology/approach: The study gathers data from 205 managers and uses partial least squares structural equation modeling to test the hypothesized relationships. Findings: Marketing metrics encourage both forms of marketing adaptation. Financial metrics use discourages exploration. Market orientation and long-term orientation strengthen (weaken) the positive (negative) relationship between marketing (financial) metrics use and marketing exploration. Metric-based training is more positively associated with both adaptive capabilities than a metric-based compensation orientation, albeit weakly. Research limitations/implications: The studyâ€™s central proposition â€“ that different metrics or metric orientations are associated with distinct types of knowledge, interpretations, mindsets, motivations and cultural contexts â€“ provides a deeper theoretical understanding of the pathways by which a metric emphasis affects marketing adaptation. Practical implications: Marketing managers should emphasize marketing metrics and training more than compensation, to promote marketing exploitation/exploration, while exercising caution in overstressing financial metrics given their negative association with exploration. This latter negative relationship can be weakened (as can the positive one between marketing metrics and exploration be strengthened) with increased market orientation and long-term orientation.

(2022),Programmable Morphing Hydrogels for Soft Actuators and Robots: From Structure Designs to Active Functions,Accounts of Chemical Research,,10.1021/acs.accounts.2c00046,"ConspectusNature provides abundant inspiration and elegant paradigms for the development of smart materials that can actuate, morph, and move on demand. One remarkable capacity of living organisms is to adapt their shapes or positions in response to stimuli. Programmed deformations or movements in plant organs are mainly driven by water absorption/dehydration of cells, while versatile motions of mollusks are based on contraction/extension of muscles. Understanding the general principles of these morphing and motion behaviors can give rise to disruptive technologies for soft robotics, flexible electronics, biomedical devices, etc. As one kind of intelligent material, hydrogels with high similarity to soft biotissues and diverse responses to external stimuli are an ideal candidate to construct soft actuators and robots.The objective of this Account is to give an overview of the fundamental principles for controllable deformations and motions of hydrogels, with a focus on the structure designs and responsive functions of the corresponding soft actuators and robots. This field has been rapidly developed in recent years with a growing understanding of working principles in natural organisms and a substantial revolution of manufacturing technologies to devise bioinspired hydrogel systems with desired structures. Diverse morphing hydrogels and soft actuators/robots have been developed on the basis of several pioneering works, ranging from bending and folding deformations of bilayer hydrogels to self-shaping of non-Euclidean hydrogel surfaces, and from thermoactuated bilayer gel ""hands"" to electrodriven polyelectrolyte gel ""worms"". These morphing hydrogels have demonstrated active functions and versatile applications in biomedical and engineering fields.In this Account, we discuss recent progress in morphing hydrogels and highlight the design principles and relevant applications. First, we introduce the fundamentals of basic deformation modes, together with generic structure features, actuation strategies, and morphing mechanisms. The advantages of in-plane gradient structures are highlighted for programmable deformations by harnessing the out-of-plane buckling with bistability nature to obtain sophisticated three-dimensional configurations. Next, we give an overview of soft actuators and robots based on morphing hydrogels and focus on the working principles of the active systems with different structure designs. We discuss the advancements of hydrogel-based soft robots capable of swift locomotion with different gaits and emphasize the significances of structure control and dynamic actuation. Then we summarize versatile applications of hydrogel-based actuators and robots in biomedicines, cargo delivery, soft electronics, information encryption, and so forth. Some hydrogel robots with a built-in feedback loop and self-sensing system exhibit collaborative functions and advanced intelligence that are informative for the design of next-generation hydrogel machines. Finally, concluding remarks are given to discuss future opportunities and remaining challenges in this field. For example, miniature hydrogel-based actuators/robots with therapeutic or diagnostic functions are highly desired for biomedical applications. The morphing mechanisms summarized in this Account should be applicable to other responsive materials. We hope that this Account will inspire more scientists to be involved in this emerging area and make contributions to reveal novel working principles, design multifunctional soft machines, and explore applications in diverse fields.

Since modernism, designers draw urban projects with the goal to improve cities performances based on a mechanistic worldview, in which living systems are almost not considered. This paradigm led to urbanisation that is prominent in ecological process simplification and biodiversity loss. Different emerging urban design frameworks engage with the challenge of integrating ecological information on the design of sustainable urban projects, using this knowledge to guide intervention choices. With a growing application in practice, as through regenerative design and biomimicry, there is still a lack of knowledge on how ecological urban projects operationalise their engagements. We explored this question with a case study approach, generating hypotheses on the topic. We identified that projects focus on reducing human pressures over the ecosystems instead of regenerating the ecosystem's structure. Furthermore, projects mainly deal with energy and material flows. We identified a taxonomy of 36 urban strategies that could inform new design tools. Finally, we argue that the ecosystem biophysical structure needs to be better addressed on urban projects, and that projects would benefit from better articulation between solutions to reduce human pressures with those regenerating the ecosystem state.

Using a quantitative methodology, 280 of 500 senior and executive managers in the automotive industry in Iran participated and completed the survey. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used for data reduction of the entire sample (to purify the scale) and to ascertain whether the survey questions were loaded on their respective dimensions (this was refined and confirmed later by CFA). Besides that, the structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine the research hypotheses and hypothesised model. Leadership, customer focus, education and training, strategic supplierâ€™s partnership, information analysis, internal lean practices and teamwork is positively associated with organisational performance.

In this respect, knowledge sharing is critical for project success. However, although knowledge sharing among team members has been investigated by many researchers, knowledge sharing barriers among people have rarely been addressed in project teams in general and software development teams in particular. Thus, the purpose of this study is to investigate knowledge sharing barriers in the software development team context and develop solutions that can overcome these barriers. Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory multiple case design was used to explore why software team members in Turkey may be reluctant to share knowledge. In this study, the authors conducted 18 in-depth and on-site semi-structured interviews and then employed content analysis, which uses a set of procedures to make valid inferences from text, to discover knowledge sharing barriers. Findings: By interviewing 18 Turkish project team managers, the authors identified knowledge-, individual- and organization-related knowledge sharing barriers among team members. They also demonstrated solutions for the knowledge sharing hesitation among team members based on the experiences of project team managers. Research limitations/implications: Some methodological limitations exist in this study. Specifically, the generalizability of the sampling limits the study, which was conducted in a specific national context, Turkish firms in general and the Istanbul district in particular. It is important to note that readers should be cautious when generalizing the results to different cultural contexts. In this regard, a Turkish sample involving the Istanbul district, like that of any culturally bound research, imposes some constraints on the interpretation and application of the results. The study was conducted with in-depth interviews of only 18 managers working in seven companies. Also, this study was performed on system development teams. The results should be confirmed with more samples and different project sets. Practical implications: In this study, the authors discover the reasons for knowledge sharing reluctance among team members and some solutions that will eliminate knowledge sharing problems by using case studies. The results show that the reluctance of team members arises from obstacles, which are knowledge-, individual- and organization-related. Also, the conclusions demonstrate that knowledge sharing barriers can be resolved by establishing project leadership, creating a knowledge sharing culture and considering team membersâ€™ emotions. Originality/value: The present study investigated whether reluctance to share knowledge derives not only from individual barriers but also from organization- and knowledge-related barriers in a project team context. The authors discovered that knowledge sharing barriers can be resolved by establishing project leadership, creating a knowledge sharing culture and considering team membersâ€™ emotions.

It was previously assumed that most SOM consisted of recalcitrant compounds, whereas the emerging view considers SOM as a range of polymers continuously processed into smaller molecules by decomposer enzymes. Mainstreaming this new paradigm in current models is challenging because of their ill-adapted framework. We propose the C-STABILITY model to resolve this issue. Its innovative framework combines compartmental and continuous modeling approaches to accurately reproduce SOM cycling processes. C-STABILITY emphasizes the influence of substrate accessibility on SOM turnover and makes enzymatic and microbial biotransformations of substrate explicit. Theoretical simulations provide new insights on how depolymerization and decomposers ecology impact organic matter chemistry and amount during decomposition and at steady state. The flexible mathematical structure of C-STABILITY offers a promising foundation for exploring new mechanistic hypotheses and supporting the design of future experiments.

Hence, the present study introduces project management innovation (PMI) as a determinant of project success (PS) and explores whether project governance (PG) and high-performance work practices (HPWPs), strengthen this relationship. To confirm these propositions, study data using adapted scales were collected from project professionals representing software development companies in the emerging IT industry in Pakistan. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to examine the hypothesized relationships and encourage PMI-guided solutions for project failures. SEM results statistically validated that project success is positively influenced by PMI, whereas this relationship is significantly strengthened through the moderating influence of PG and HPWPs, respectively. Theoretically, the present research is the first of its kind to introduce and empirically examine these untested relationships between PMI, PG, HPWPs, and PS in a single framework. These novel findings hold strategic value for both project managers and organizational leaders who oversee a range of project portfolios.

An exploratory study,South African Journal of Physiotherapy,Cognitive load theory; Pedagogy; Problem-based learning; Spinal biomechanics; Spinal deformity; Vision-based augmented reality,10.4102/sajp.v77i2.1579,"Background: Knowledge of anatomy and pathology of the spine together with spinal deformities is integral to several healthcare disciplines. This knowledge is crucial for graduates for assessment and management of patients with spinal problems. Physiotherapy students generally find it difficult to conceptualise the integrity of the structure and function of the spine that affects their acquisition of related physiotherapy skills. Objective: Our first objective was to introduce and evaluate the use of a Vision-Based Augmented Reality (VBAR) mobile application to teach students the anatomy and accessory movements of the spine. A further objective was to explore student experiences of and engagement with VBAR by conducting a post-lecture survey comparing VBAR to traditional teaching. Methods: This post-intervention crossover design study included two groups: final year physiotherapy students (n = 74) and mean age of 23 (Â±1.8). The computing department at Teesside University developed the VBAR mobile application. Moreover, a survey adapted from a previously published article was disseminated to students to evaluate their level of understanding following the use of the VBAR application. Results: The results demonstrated that the median questionnaire scores in studentsâ€™ perceived level of understanding for the VBAR group were significantly higher than for the traditional teaching group (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The results of this post-intervention survey suggest that the integration of VBAR learning activities results in gains relating to studentsâ€™ understanding of spinal anatomy, function, pathology and deformities. These findings suggest that VBAR could be an additional teaching tool to support student learning. Clinical implications: Greater understanding is expected to increase the quality of clinical practice. Â© 2021. The Authors.

Perhaps attributable, in part, to the large amount of data that is made available through the adoption of computer-based learning systems in classrooms and larger-scale MOOC platforms, many educational researchers are leveraging a wide range of emerging deep learning approaches to study learning and student behavior in various capacities. Variations of recurrent neural networks, for example, have been used to not only predict learning outcomes but also to study sequential and temporal trends in student data; it is commonly believed that they are able to learn high-dimensional representations of learning and behavioral constructs over time, such as the evolution of a studentsâ€™ knowledge state while working through assigned content. Recent works, however, have started to dispute this belief, instead finding that it may be the modelâ€™s complexity that leads to improved performance in many prediction tasks and that these methods may not inherently learn these temporal representations through model training. In this work, we explore these claims further in the context of detectors of student affect as well as expanding on existing work that explored benchmarks in knowledge tracing. Specifically, we observe how well trained models perform compared to deep learning networks where training is applied only to the output layer. While the highest results of prior works utilizing trained recurrent models are found to be superior, the application of our untrained-versions perform comparably well, outperforming even previous non-deep learning approaches.

Design/methodology/approach The proposed conceptual framework was developed from a comprehensive review of the related literature. This study tested and validated the proposed framework using partial least square structural equation model based on the data collected through a survey. Findings First, perceived hedonic benefit was positively affected by content personalization, user interaction design and technological innovation. Perceived social benefit and perceived self-achievement benefit were positively affected by user interaction design and technological innovation. Second, user content creation behavior was affected by perceived social benefit and perceived self-achievement benefit; user browsing behavior was significantly affected only by perceived hedonic benefit, and interaction behavior was significantly affected by perceived hedonic benefit, perceived social benefit and perceived self-achievement benefit. Third, perceived social benefit and perceived self-achievement benefit partially mediated the relationship between user interaction design and interaction behavior. As for the influence of technological innovation on interaction behavior, however, and the influence of user interaction design and technological innovation on content creation behavior, both perceived social benefit and perceived self-achievement benefit had complete mediation. Originality/value This study found that the characteristics of developing CCVBCs affected perceived benefit in participating in the value co-creation process. The results contributed to the value creation research by enriching the understanding of user value co-creation in developing CCVBCs.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/APJML-04-2021-0253,WOS,Journal

Despite the potential for these win-win advances, survey data of U.S. local governments indicate these types of equity investments remain rare. This study explores barriers and pathways to distributional equity via energy-efficient housing. Using archival city sustainability survey data collected during a period of heightened U.S. federal investment in local government energy-efficiency programs, we combine machine learning (ML) and process-tracing approaches for modeling the complex drivers and barriers underlying these decisions. First, we ask, how do characteristics of a city's organizational learning methodsâ€”its administrative structure, past experience with housing programs, resources, stakeholder engagement and planningâ€”predict policy commitments to green affordable housing? Using ensemble ML methods, we find that three specific modes of organizational learningâ€”past experience with affordable housing programs, seeking assistance from neighborhood groups and the technical expertise of professional green organizationsâ€”are the most impactful features in determining city commitments to constructing green affordable housing. Our second stage uses process-tracing within a specific case identified by the ML models to determine the ordering of these factors and to provide more nuance on green-housing policy implementation.

In these environments, Triple Helix has been operationalized in different ways, spaces, and contexts where those agents are transforming their roles in the development and strengthening of national innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystems. As a consequence, the phenomenon of entrepreneurial innovations emerged from enterprises with an entrepreneurial or high-growth orientation that collaborate with Triple Helix agents generating economic benefits and spillover effects. In emerging economies, the available literature about innovation and entrepreneurship is limited to explore the determinants of innovation performance as well as innovation constrains. Based on this argument and diverging from prior research, this research tries to provide a better understanding about the influence of Triple Helix agents on entrepreneurial innovations' performance of enterprises located in emerging economies. In particular, we analyze the effects produced by the links of enterprises with other enterprises, universities and government on their innovation performance (e.g., access to knowledge/technology, sources of funding, government subsidies), as well as, the moderation effects generated when those enterprises have a high-growth orientation (e.g., distinction of enterprises that develop entrepreneurial innovations or traditional innovations). To achieve this aim we look inside at the case of Mexico because is an emerging economy that during the last two decades has facing a transition to a knowledge-based economy. Using a cross-section dataset of 19,188 Mexican enterprises interviewed in the period of 2006 to 2012, we tested our proposed conceptual model with a Tobit regression. Our study provides interesting implications for the main actors involved in the Mexican Science, Technology and Innovation System, as well as, contributes about the debate of the impact of enterprises-university-government linkages on entrepreneurial innovations from diverse perspectives and research fields (e.g., open innovation, knowledge transfer, high-growth entrepreneurship, academic entrepreneurship, public entrepreneurship).

(2021),Domain-driven models yield better predictions at lower cost than reservoir computers in Lorenz systems,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES,,10.1098/rsta.2020.0246,"Recent advances in computing algorithms and hardware have rekindled interest in developing high-accuracy, low-cost surrogate models for simulating physical systems. The idea is to replace expensive numerical integration of complex coupled partial differential equations at fine time scales performed on supercomputers, with machine-learned surrogates that efficiently and accurately forecast future system states using data sampled from the underlying system. One particularly popular technique being explored within the weather and climate modelling community is the echo state network (ESN), an attractive alternative to other well-known deep learning architectures. Using the classical Lorenz 63 system, and the three tier multi-scale Lorenz 96 system (Thomes T, Duben P, Palmer T. 2017 Q. J. R. Meteorol. Soc. 143, 897-908. (doi:10.1002/qj.2974)) as benchmarks, we realize that previously studied state-of-the-art ESNs operate in two distinct regimes, corresponding to low and high spectral radius (LSR/HSR) for the sparse, randomly generated, reservoir recurrence matrix. Using knowledge of the mathematical structure of the Lorenz systems along with systematic ablation and hyperparameter sensitivity analyses, we show that state-of-the-art LSR-ESNs reduce to a polynomial regression model which we call Domain-Driven Regularized Regression (D2R2). Interestingly, D2R2 is a generalization of the well-known SINDy algorithm (Brunton SL, Proctor JL, Kutz JN. 2016 Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 113, 39323937. (doi:10.1073/pnas.1517384113)). We also show experimentally that LSR-ESNs (Chattopadhyay A, Hassanzadeh P, Subramanian D. 2019 (http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08829)) outperform HSR ESNs (Pathak J, Hunt B, Girvan M, Lu Z, Ott E. 2018 Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 024102. (doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.024102)) while D2R2 dominates both approaches. A significant goal in constructing surrogates is to cope with barriers to scaling in weather prediction and simulation of dynamical systems that are imposed by time and energy consumption in supercomputers. Inexact computing has emerged as a novel approach to helping with scaling. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of three models (LSR-ESN, HSR-ESN and D2R2) by varying the precision or word size of the computation as our inexactness-controlling parameter. For precisions of 64, 32 and 16 bits, we show that, surprisingly, the least expensive D2R2 method yields the most robust results and the greatest savings compared to ESNs. Specifically, D2R2 achieves 68x in computational savings, with an additional 2x if precision reductions are also employed, outperforming ESN variants by a large margin.

Rapid advancement of technology and the increasing ease with which communication and interaction can occur has dramatically changed the landscape in which teachers of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) operate. The contemporary skills that students are required to possess include inter alia problem solving, creativity, teamwork abilities, communication skills and emotional intelligence. Despite the universal acceptance of their importance, these skills are commonly cited as underdeveloped and in addition, are still accompanied by outmoded 'traditional' forms of teaching and assessment. While the approaches of twentieth-century education were successful in developing knowledge stores, the ubiquity of access to knowledge-coupled with the constantly changing nature of the world today-requires alternative conceptions of teaching and learning. This article focuses primarily on an exploration of learning metaphors and teaching with the overall lens of creating self-regulated and furthermore, self-determined learners. The article begins with an exploration of learning in STEM education and a critique of the pedagogical perspective, discussing why this epistemology may be insufficient for contemporary STEM learning. The article then considers an alternative and potentially more contemporary notion; the emergent pedagogic space. The article presents a theoretical model to conceptualise learning in STEM education, with the goal of informing both practice and research.

Yet, poor communities generally experience fractured systems of care, a paucity of providers, and limited resources to deliver intensive home-visiting models to families who stand to benefit most. This article explores lessons emerging from the recent Tribal Maternal and Infant Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) legislation supporting delivery of home-visiting interventions in low-income, hard-to-reach American Indian and Alaska Native communities. We draw experience from four diverse tribal communities that participated in the Tribal MIECHV Program and overcame socioeconomic, geographic, and structural challenges that called for both early childhood home-visiting services and increased the difficulty of delivery.Â Key innovations are described, including unique community engagement, recruitment and retention strategies, expanded case management roles of home visitors to overcome fragmented care systems, contextual demands for employing paraprofessional home visitors, and practical advances toward streamlined evaluation approaches. We draw on the concept of â€œfrugal innovationâ€ to explain how the experience of Tribal MIECHV participation has led to more efficient, effective, and culturally informed early childhood home-visiting service delivery, with lessons for future dissemination to underserved communities in the United States and abroad.

AgorIP was established by a partnership from academia, health service and industry to support economic development and improved health outcomes through technology transfer. In parallel, the WFGA was created by the National Assembly for Wales with the aim of improving the social, economic, environmental and cultural well-being of Wales. This case study examines the AgorIP initiative and its project portfolio against the goals embedded within the WFGA. In order to explore both structural and operational alignment with the WFGA Goals, this study examines the regional policy and economic context, the AgorIP operation, and the emerging project portfolio. This is undertaken in the context of Technology Transfer (Bradley, Hayter et al. 2013) and Regional Innovation System (Cooke 2004) models, using bibliographic review of AgorIP project data, supported by insight from the relevant literature. Findings that the majority of AgorIP opportunities have relevance to multiple WFGA Goals suggests the activity may lead to impact beyond its original core economic development ambitions. Recognising, understanding and communicating the breadth of potential benefits from technology transfer is of importance to both practitioners and policy-makers who will want to develop joined-up interventions and maximise impact of public investment into such activities.

Careful analysis of the single-crystal structure before and after ordered molecular motion, coupled with theoretical calculations, reveals the effective intermolecular charge transfer generated by the dense packing mode to be responsible for the RTP effect. Accordingly, a dual anti-counterfeiting application is successfully implemented, exploiting the RTP effect of the stimulus response.

To fill this gap, transfer learning, a subdomain of machine learning that serves to transfer knowledge from a generalized model to a more domain-specific model, provides a promising solution. While transfer learning has been used in natural language processing, image analysis, and chemical engineering fault detection, its application within biochemical engineering has not been systematically explored. In this study, we demonstrated the benefits of transfer learning when applied to predict dynamic behaviors of new biochemical processes. Two different case studies were presented to investigate the accuracy, reliability, and advantage of this innovative modeling approach. We thoroughly discussed the different transfer learning strategies and the effects of topology on transfer learning, comparing the performance of the transfer learning models against benchmark kinetic and data-driven models. Furthermore, strong connections between the underlying process mechanism and the transfer learning model's optimal structure were highlighted, suggesting the interpretability of transfer learning to enable more accurate prediction than a naive data-driven modeling approach. Therefore, this study shows a novel approach to effectively combining data from different resources for bioprocess simulation.

This study aims to address the ambidextrous innovation (radical and incremental) associated with firm performance on the SMEs and investigate the moderating effect of environmental factors on the relationship between technological innovation and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach The authors formulate a path model with the variables to investigate the impacts of the two different innovation strategies and their joint effects on firm performance. Meanwhile, they hypothesized that external environmental factors - market dynamism, labour availability, business cost and competitive hostility - moderate the association of radical and incremental innovations with firm performance. The validity of the proposed model was evaluated using a structural equation modelling approach. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to evaluate the convergent validity of the constructs. Findings The authors find that positive association between radical innovation and firm performance; it shows that the radical innovation strategies are positively related to firm performance in SMEs. They also find that the relationship between radical innovation and firm performance has moderated by environmental factors. Second, they find that the incremental innovation strategies have a negative impact to firm performance, and the relationship between incremental innovation and firm performance has no moderated by environmental factors.

This article aims to review the literature on these two concepts and suggest a novel theoretical framework. First, we identify that, in the relevant literature, industrial policy acquires progressively a repositioned content, described as a new, holistic, multidimensional, or integrated policy that can help create and sustain the competitiveness of the firms, industries, localities, nations, or other socio-economic agglomerations. In this context, we explore the form of an actual integrated industrial policy and propose the theoretical framework of the competitiveness web. in which the co-evolution of micro-meso-macro levels aie explored, by placing the dynamics of business innovation at the dialectic center of the overall developmental process. This integrated industrial policy to strengthen competitiveness must also be able to promote innovation in the different local and regional ecosystems and. therefore, we conceive a policy mechanism in the form of the Institutes of Local Development and Innovation (ILDI). The primary purpose of these institutes is to diagnose and strengthen the Stra. Tech. Man physiology (strategy-technology-management synthesis) of the local socio-economic organizations. We believe that this new approach to the integrated industrial policy to strengthen the local competitiveness can contribute to facilitating the adaptation of the socio-economic systems, and especially the less dynamic and developed, to the new emerging challenges of the crisis and restructuring of globalization in the pandemic era.

These data are worth exploring because they often contain complementary information that improves the quality of the analysis results. Clustering with multi-view data is a particularly challenging problem as revealing the complex data structures between many feature spaces demands discriminative features that are specific to the task and, when too few of these features are present, performance suffers. Extreme learning machines (ELMs) are an emerging form of learning model that have shown an outstanding representation ability and superior performance in a range of different learning tasks. Motivated by the promise of this advancement, we have developed a novel multi-view fusion clustering framework based on an ELM, called MVEC. MVEC learns the embeddings from each view of the data via the ELM network, then constructs a single unified embedding according to the correlations and dependencies between each embedding and automatically weighting the contribution of each. This process exposes the underlying clustering structures embedded within multi-view data with a high degree of accuracy. A simple yet efficient solution is also provided to solve the optimization problem within MVEC. Experiments and comparisons on eight different benchmarks from different domains confirm MVEC's clustering accuracy.

In recent years, the importance of non-research universities in regional development and innovation has been increasingly recognized (Taylor et al., 2008). Among a small volume of studies exploring the role of universities of applied science (UASs), or non research universities, in the process of regional innovation, a constant challenge has been that of applying appropriate theoretical or analytical frameworks. Currently, most studies in this field apply theoretical insights originally developed for under standing the relationship between research universities and regional innovation systems. The most commonly used frameworks are, for instance, the Triple Helix model (Etzkowitz, 2008; Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff, 1995, 1997) for analysing the UASs and industry links (Yang et al., 2016), and the â€˜five pathways to an entrepreneurial universityâ€™ (Clark, 1998) for understanding the organizational responses of UASs to the emerging demands of regional development (Lyytinen, 2011).

These changes are also reflected in the dynamics of water-borne diseases as some of the causative agents of these illnesses are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment and their survival rates are impacted by changes in climatic conditions. Previous studies have established strong relationships between essential climate variables and the coastal distribution and seasonal dynamics of the bacteria Vibrio cholerae, pathogenic types of which are responsible for human cholera disease. In this study we provide a novel exploration of the potential of a machine learning approach to forecast environmental cholera risk in coastal India, home to more than 200 million inhabitants, utilising atmospheric, terrestrial and oceanic satellite-derived essential climate variables. A Random Forest classifier model is developed, trained and tested on a cholera outbreak dataset over the period 2010-2018 for districts along coastal India. The random forest classifier model has an Accuracy of 0.99, an F1 Score of 0.942 and a Sensitivity score of 0.895, meaning that 89.5% of outbreaks are correctly identified. Spatio-temporal patterns emerged in terms of the model's performance based on seasons and coastal locations. Further analysis of the specific contribution of each Essential Climate Variable to the model outputs shows that chlorophyll-a concentration, sea surface salinity and land surface temperature are the strongest predictors of the cholera outbreaks in the dataset used. The study reveals promising potential of the use of random forest classifiers and remotely-sensed essential climate variables for the development of environmental cholera-risk applications. Further exploration of the present random forest model and associated essential climate variables is encouraged on cholera surveillance datasets in other coastal areas affected by the disease to determine the model's transferability potential and applicative value for cholera forecasting systems.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17249378,WOS,Journal

Studying the carbon emission efficiency of each province helps us to learn about the characteristics and evolution of regional carbon emissions, which is important for proposing effective and targeted measures to achieve the carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals. This paper measures the carbon emission efficiency of 30 Chinese provinces from 2006 to 2019 based on a three-stage SBM-undesirable model and explores external drivers using stochastic frontier models. The results of the SBM-undesirable model show that the inter-provincial carbon emission efficiency is unevenly distributed and shows a big difference. From the results of the stochastic frontier model analysis, external drivers such as the intensity of finance in environmental protection, the level of economic development, the industrial structure, the level of urbanization, the degree of openness and the level of science as well as technology innovation all have an impact on the emission efficiency. In terms of LSTM model prediction, the model shows an excellent fitting effect, which provides a possible path for carbon emission efficiency prediction.

This paper provides an analysis of the approaches and methods for real-time sensor and control information processing with the application of machine learning, as well as successful cases of machine learning application in the synthesis of a robot's sensor and control systems. Among the robotic systems under investigation are (a) adaptive robots with slip displacement sensors and fuzzy logic implementation for sensor data processing, (b) magnetically controlled mobile robots for moving on inclined and ceiling surfaces with neuro-fuzzy observers and neuro controllers, and (c) robots that are functioning in unknown environments with the prediction of the control system state using statistical learning theory.

Based on dynamic spatial panel data of 30 provincial administrative regions in China from 2007 to 2017, this study attempts to establish the framework of a transmission mechanism among land granting, manufacturing agglomeration and technological innovation, and green total factor productivity, and measures their interactions by the mixed directional distance function and Global Malmquist-Luenberger index model containing undesirable output. Then, this paper empirically estimates the impacts of land granting, industrial agglomeration and technological innovation on green total factor productivity in China with a dynamic spatial mediating effect model. The results show that the development paradigm of China's industrial green economy is characterized by path dependence, and industrial GTFP has a significant spatial effect. Local governments rely on low-price competition to obtain cost advantages and facilitate the agglomeration of local manufacturing industries, and promote the impact of negotiation on industrial GTFP through the mediating effect of manufacturing agglomeration. There exists a non-linear relationship between manufacturing agglomeration and industrial GTFP. The land acquired through negotiation has a promoting effect on green technology innovation, and will foster industrial GTFP through the intermediary effect of technological innovation. No obvious non-linear relationship is observed between technological innovation and industrial GTFP. The grant of Tender, Auction and Listing has no significant influence on the industrial GTFP, and the mediating conduction effect on the GTFP of industry is not established. Industrial structure, government management and infrastructure will significantly promote the improvement of industrial GTFP, while the level of transportation will inhibit the improvement of industrial GTFP. Through administrative intervention in low-production capacity departments, local governments can integrate regional resource endowments, give play to the comparative advantages of industries, and achieve industrial structure upgrades and core competitiveness, which will be conducive to the improvement of industrial GTFP.

However, existing KGs are far from complete. Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) has been studied to complete KGs by inferring missing entities or relations. But most previous methods require that all entities should be seen during training, which is impractical for real-world KGs with new entities emerging daily. In this paper, we address the open-world KGR task: how to perform reasoning when entities are not observed at training time. The description-embodied knowledge representation learning (DKRL) model attempts to study the open-world KGR task. We find that DKRL does not consider hierarchical type information contained in entities when learning entities and relations representations, which results in poor performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel model, SDT, that incorporates the structural information, entity descriptions, and hierarchical type information of entities into a unified framework to learn more representative embeddings for KGs. Specifically, for entity descriptions, we explore continuous bag-of-words and convolutional neural networks models to encode the semantics of entity representations. For hierarchical types, we utilize a recursive hierarchy encoder and a weighted hierarchy encoder to construct the projection matrices of hierarchical types. We evaluate the SDT model on both open-world and closed-world reasoning tasks, including entity prediction and relation prediction. Experimental results on large-scale datasets show that SDT achieves a lower mean rank and higher Hits@10 than the baseline methods.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113889,WOS,Journal

The hypothesis of different paths of OI implementation is shaped across three theoretical dimensions: (1) the combination of open innovation approaches (the choice of the governance mode); (2) the type of knowledge exchanged (scientific knowledge, technological knowledge, product/ market knowledge); and (3) the sectoral innovation system to which the company belongs (characterized by different technological opportunities, innovation sources, and appropriability regimes). A multiple case study design has been adopted in order to investigate how and why the process of OI implementation in SMEs may be bounded by ""hidden costs"" hampering effectiveness. The study delivers four different paths of OI implementation (scienceoriented, technology-driven, application-oriented, and communitydriven) and demonstrates that SMEs in each path differently seek opportunities and face different risks.

Different theories of adolescent behaviour attribute this to different internal mechanisms like undeveloped cognitive control, higher sensation-seeking or extraordinary social motivation. Many agree that some of adolescent risk-taking behaviour is adaptive. Here we argue that to understand adolescent risk-taking, and why it may be adaptive, research needs to pay attention to the adolescent environmentsâ€™ structure and view adolescents as learning and exploring agents in it. We identify three unique aspects of the adolescent environment: 1) the opportunities to take risks are increased significantly, 2) these opportunities are novel and their outcomes uncertain, and 3) peers become more important. Next, we illustrate how adolescent risk-taking may emerge from learning using agent-based modelling, and show that a typical inverted-U shape in risk-taking may emerge in absence of a specific adolescent motivational drive for sensation-seeking or sensitivity to social information. The simulations also show how risky exploration may be necessary for adolescents to gain long-term benefits in later developmental stages and that social learning can help reduce losses. Finally, we discuss how a renewed ecological perspective and the focus on adolescents as learning agents may shift the interpretation of current findings and inspire future studies.

Firms may rely on organisational learning to acquire knowledge to drive the implementation of circular economy practices to achieve organisational sustainability and improve performance. Drawing on the resource orchestration, knowledge based view and the natural resource based view theories, we develop and propose a model that explores the role of intra and inter-organisational learning, lean product development, lean manufacturing practices and zero waste practices in advancing circular economy target performance and organisational identity among small and medium enterprises in an emerging economy. The study employs a quantitative research approach where the survey data is gathered from managers of manufacturing small and medium enterprises in Ghana to test the validity of the hypotheses using partial least square structural equation modelling. The results suggest that intra organisational learning require effective implementation of inter-organisational learning, whiles both intra and inter organisational learning positively impact lean product development, zero waste practices and lean manufacturing practices and zero waste practices. The results also indicate that circular economy target performance and organisational identity can be driven through the adoption of intra organisational learning, lean product development, lean manufacturing practices and zero waste practices. Thus, there is the need to promote inter and intra organisational learning processes to acquire knowledge from diverse sources to support the implementation of circular economy practices such as zero waste practices, lean product development and lean manufacturing practices to advance circular economy target performance and organisational identity.

Sometimes these conflicts over how actors will benefit from an action are not revealed until actors are brought together. However, a barrier to change occurs when IP actors use their existing power to mobilise resources to influence if and how individual and collective interests are aligned. In the context of agricultural innovation and transitions, this paper uses the power in transitions framework (Avelino and Wittmayer, 2016), along with analytical perspectives on conflicts and role perceptions, to understand how consciously staging or revealing conflicts of interest among IP actors changed role perceptions and power relations among these actors. The paper explores this topic in two IPs addressing agricultural production and sustainability challenges in New Zealand's agricultural sector. Conflicts were staged in IPs when one group of actors mobilised resources that enabled them to move existing power relations from one-sided, to synergistic or a mutual dependency. This enabled conflicts to be acknowledged and solved. In contrast, conflicts were not staged when actors mobilised resources to maintain antagonostic power relations. Our cases demontrate that staging conflicts to change actors' role perceptions is an important intermediary step to forming new power relations in the agricultural system. Our findings highlight the need for IP theory to conceptualise power relations in IPs as context specific, dynamic and a force shaping outcomes, rather than solely a force exerted by actors in the incumbent regime over IP actors.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2020.04.022,WOS,Journal

Machine-learning approaches such as association rule mining (ARM) have been proven very effective in extracting biologically relevant associations among different genes. Despite of the usefulness of ARM, time relations among associated genes cannot be modeled with a standard ARM approach, though temporal information is critical for the understanding of regulatory mechanisms in biological processes. Sequential rule mining (SRM) methods have been proposed for mining temporal relations in temporal data instead. Although successful, existing SRM applications on temporal microarray data have been exclusively designed for in vitro experiments in yeast and none extension to in vivo data sets has been proposed to date. Contrary to what happen with in vitro experiments, when dealing with microarray data derived from humans or animals the subject variability is the main issue to address, so that databases include multiple sequences instead of a single one. A wide variety of SRM approaches could be used to handle with these particularities. In this study, we propose an adaptation of the particular SRM method CMRules to extract sequential association rules from temporal gene expression data derived from humans. In addition to the data mining process, we further propose the validation of extracted rules through the integration of results along with external resources of biological knowledge (functional and pathway annotation databases). The employed data set consists on temporal gene expression data collected in three different time points during the course of a dietary intervention in 57 subjects with obesity (data set available with identifier GSE77962 in the Gene Expression Omnibus repository). Published by Vink [1], the original clinical trial investigated the effects on weight loss of two different dietary interventions (a low-calorie diet or a very lowcalorie diet). In conclusion, the proposed method demonstrated a good ability to extract sequential association rules with further biological relevance within the context of obesity. Thus, the application of this method could be successfully extended to other longitudinal microarray data sets derived from humans.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-17935-9_29,WOS,Conference Paper

Background The key factor to improving innovation performance in an enterprise is to share knowledge with other enterprises in the same cluster and use dynamic capabilities to absorb, integrate, and create knowledge. However, the relationships among these concepts remain unclear. Based on the dynamic capability theory, this study empirically reveals how enterprises drive innovation performance through knowledge sharing. Methodology Survey data from 238 cluster enterprises were used in this study. The sample was collected from industrial clusters in Chinaâ€™s Fujian province that belong to the automobile, optoelectronic, and microwave communications industries. Through structural equation modeling, this study assessed the relationships among ambidextrous knowledge sharing, dynamic capabilities, and innovation performance. Contribution This study contributes to the burgeoning literature on knowledge management in China, an important emerging economy. It also enriches the exploration of innovation performance in the cluster context and expands research on the dynamic mechanism from a knowledge perspective. Findings Significant relationships are found between ambidextrous knowledge sharing and innovation performance. First, ambidextrous knowledge sharing positively influences the innovation performance of cluster enterprises. Further, knowledge absorption and knowledge generation capabilities play a mediating role in this relationship, which confirms that dynamic capabilities are a partial mediator in the relationship between ambidextrous knowledge sharing and innovation performance. Recommendations The results highlight the crucial role of knowledge management in contributing for Practitioners to cluster innovation and management practices. They indicate that cluster enterprises should consider the importance of knowledge sharing and dynamic capabilities for improving innovation performance and establish a multi-agent knowledge sharing platform. Recommendations Researchers could further explore the role of other mediating variables (e.g., for Researchers organizational agility, industry growth) as well as moderating variables (e.g., environmental uncertainty, learning orientation). Impact on Society This study provides a reference for enterprises in industrial clusters to use knowledge-based capabilities to enhance their competitive advantage. Future Research Future research could collect data from various countries and regions to test the research model and conduct a comparative analysis of industrial clusters.

This paper reports on one strand of research being carried out as part of the EU FP7 TURAS project (Transitioning to Urban Resilience and Sustainability) that aims to gain insight into the implications of social-ecological resilience thinking on urban planning practice and policy by presenting a unique, trans-disciplinary perspective that has been developed collaboratively between academic, local government and SME partners. A framework for adaptive co-management and design is introduced as a basis for the operationalisation of urban resilience, highlighting the need to actively solve problems collaboratively by exercising imagination and creativity, and presenting a new and potentially fertile source for innovation. Five experiments exploring urban planning practices relating to the framework are put forward as examples of urban resilience in practice: an online crowd-sourcing application for mapping underused spaces; an interactive timeline tool for identifying drivers of change over time; a guidance and signposting tool to help community projects overcome resource barriers; an epistemic network of citizens that exchanges knowledge and resources relating to underused spaces; and an online portal that provides visibility for community groups or projects, and facilitates horizontal networking. The paper describes each experiment, sets out the aims and theoretical contexts, records any initial findings, and reflects on the potential and limitations. Initial findings are discussed relating to the challenges of crowd-sourcing spatial or historical data, and the resource commitment required for the emerging practices. It is observed that the experiments attempt to address fundamental issues in urban planning practice and policy, and involve established and familiar activities. The paper concludes that the research provides insight into what urban resilience might mean in practice and that each experiment has the potential to make a tangible contribution to the transition to urban resilience and sustainability.

Based on an exploratory case study on the innovation ecosystem of a nuclear power giant-China general nuclear power group (CGN) for the period 1987-2014, this paper presents a framework to explicate the micro-foundation of the formation mechanism of an innovation ecosystem for CoPs. Three ecosystem stages are identified: ecosystem incubation, ecosystem figuration and ecosystem self-renewal. Through the three stages, CGN has been extending its ecosystem gradually from core business to extended network and ecosystem periphery.

Rapid structural economic changes, the importance of innovation, and a shorter lifecycle of products require education systems to adjust to the needs of economies and individuals. Educational reforms in many countries aim to improve school students' readiness for their important move to post-school life. Countries organize different pathways for students following secondary school level that are designed to meet both students' demands and the needs of economies. This article explores Hong Kong students' aspirations and realities. Although the majority of students plan to complete the final year of high school and 91.5% planned to undertake the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE) to be eligible for higher education, in reality a significant number of school leavers do not perform well and should undertake training for employment. In addition, many students who are eligible for tertiary education cannot be admitted to government sponsored universities due to the limited number of places. This article begins with a consideration of students' aspirations, and then outlines the realities of transition and current issues.

Design/methodology/approach A theoretical model was established, and a questionnaire survey was conducted among 152 professionals. The collected datas were analyzed by the structural equation modeling (SEM) method. Findings The study identified four critical factors that influence the government's decision to trust the private sector in public-private-partnership (PPP) projects. All the four factors have a positively correlated impact on the government's trust decision-making. The structural equation path analysis shows that the most important factor affecting the government's trust decision-making is the trustee's (private sector) trustworthy characteristics, and the path coefficient is 0.92. The path coefficients of risk perception and the trustor's trust tendency are 0.83 and 0.74, respectively. The influence of the legal system environment on government trust decision-making is moderate, with a path coefficient of 0.68.

Designing these heterogeneous systems is becoming increasingly hard due to a plethora of architectural choices. Whole meta-level programming environments are required for designing and architecting heterogeneity of both systems and the applications running on those systems. Hewlett Packard Enterpriseâ„¢ (HPE) has found Sandia's Structural Simulation Toolkit (SST) to be a powerful aid to architectural exploration and validation of applications optimized for use with Fabric Attached Memory (FAM) with near memory compute abilities. Standard SST components have been augmented with plug-ins modeling Cray Slingshotâ„¢ Network Interface Controller (NIC) and router elements with drivers for OpenSHMEM and OpenFAM APIs. We anticipate future initiatives calling for dramatic improvement across broader HPC application areas to require refined processes in the collaborative invention of new heterogeneous designs. In this article, we present our process of using white-box characterization of applications at a node level to create abstract models and discuss the methodologies that are used to reliably extend simulations to scales of 10's of thousands of nodes to estimate large scale throughput. Our application and API simulation methodology ensures high communication resource utilization with robust, straightforward interfaces conducive to collaborative heterogeneous accelerator integration. Application and system developers are thus enabled to exploit heterogeneity to support higher system throughput.

Diverse applications of machine learning have exhibited promising outcomes in recent times in the areas of autonomous vehicles, natural language processing, computer vision and web searching. An important application of machine learning is to extract meaningful signatures from the unstructured data. The process facilitates identification of important information in the hour of need. In this work, the authors have explored the application of machine learning for content based image classification with remotely sensed image data. A hybrid approach of machine learning is implemented in this work for enhancing the classification accuracy and to use classification as a pre cursor of retrieval. Further, the approaches are compared with respect to their classification performances. Observed results have revealed the superiority of the hybrid approach of classification over the individual classification results.

Empirical data were collected from 196 entrepreneurs and top executives in Chinese high-tech new ventures using an interview survey. An established mediation model's assessment approach was used to test hypotheses through multivariate linear regression analyses. The analysis results show that both effectuation and causation have positive effects on opportunity identification. Also, emergent/planned knowledge integration plays a fully mediating role in the relationship between effectuation/causation and opportunity identification. This research contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence to explain the problem of entrepreneurial opportunity identification under high uncertainty through the lens of effectuation theory. It facilitates the development of effectuation theory and enriches the literature on strategic knowledge integration.

These learning processes represent a valuable source for entrepreneurship development in incumbent enterprises in the forms of innovative products, services, processes or organizational renewal. Design/methodology/approach - An extreme case study is the project Mimprendo (www.mimprendo.it), an initiative promoted by the Italian Conference of the University Colleges and the Italian Association of Young Entrepreneurs in collaboration with Italian universities. This is analyzed in the period 2009-2015, during which seven editions were developed. Findings - A framework is presented based on collaborative EL processes to perform relevant entrepreneurial projects in knowledge-intensive enterprises. The framework provides a coherent and systematic approach to generate, select and implement entrepreneurial practices in incumbent companies starting from a project competition involving creative students and innovative entrepreneurs. EL processes in the community composed of entrepreneurs, experts and university students are grouped into the entrepreneurial phases of inspiration, exploration, exploitation, acceleration and growth, and include the learning processes of intuition and sensing, contamination, experiential and contextual learning, experimenting and acting and finally thinking and reflecting. Research limitations/implications - Implications for research can be identified according to many perspectives to deepen the centrality of the learning process in the research on knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship. Practical implications - The framework results to be a promising approach to diffuse an entrepreneurial culture both in incumbent enterprises and in university students through a synergic collaboration among industry, university and institution. Practical implications could be derived for enterprise, students and educators involved in the design of innovative learning initiatives to sustain the development of an entrepreneurial mind-set. Originality/value - The framework contributes to extending an emerging research area exploring entrepreneurship as a never-ending dynamic learning process. The involvement of brilliant university students in activating EL process with entrepreneurs in incumbent enterprises represents a novel aspect in the field of entrepreneurship and innovation.",2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJEBR-12-2015-0315,WOS,Journal

A qualitative study based on empirical analysis offers a novel approach to exploring key factors, focussing on seven water models in the context of two organisations at the science-policy interface: the PIREN-Seine in France and the CRC for Water Sensitive Cities in Australia. Tentative linkages drawn from these examples identify: (1) objective and expertise; (2) knowledge and tools; and (3) support structures as main drivers influencing the production of scientific knowledge which, in turn, affect the use and utility of modelling tools. Further insight is gained by highlighting the wide spectrum of uses and utilities existing in practice, suggesting that such boundary organisations' facilitate interactions and exchanges that give added value to scientific knowledge. Coordinated strategies that integrate inter-, extra-, and intra-boundary activities, framed through collaborative scenario building and the use of interactive modelling platforms, may offer ways to enhance the use and utility of scientific knowledge (and its tools) to better support water resources management, policy and planning decisions, thus promoting a more cohesive relationship between science and policy.",2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w9120983,WOS,Journal

Performance-improvement-oriented application of external supply knowledge present further challenges for the function. To examine this, we draw on the knowledge-based view and develop a hypothesized model in which supply knowledge acquisition drives PSM exploration and exploitation orientations which in turn mediate the organizational status of PSM function in terms of supply performance. We test the model on an SME-focused and survey-based dataset, using structural equation modelling. Our results indicate that an exploitative orientation is associated with knowledge gained from the supply base, whereas an explorative orientation is predominantly associated with supply market knowledge and less with supply base knowledge, suggesting natural pairings. The findings also show how an exploitative development orientation mediates the positive association of the PSM function's organizational status with supply performance. Driven by supply base knowledge, a status-empowered exploitative PSM orientation may suppress supply market based explorative orientation in resource-scarce SMEs, thus appearing to serve as the sole path to supply performance. Our research contributes by pointing out the significance of the knowledge-resource, and the knowledge-based view, in understanding performance in PSM.

On the basis of the knowledge and experience gained about the interactions between neighboring molecular gears, we here explore the transmission of rotational motion and energy over larger distances, namely, through a longer chain of gear-like passive ""slave"" molecules. Such microscopic gears exhibit quite different behaviors compared to rigid cogwheels in the macroscopic world due to their structural flexibility affecting intermolecular interaction. Here, we investigate the capabilities of such gear chains and reveal the mechanisms of the transmission process in terms of both quantum-level density functional theory (DFT) and simple classical mechanics. We find that the transmission of rotation along gear chains depends strongly on the gear-gear distance: short distances can cause tilting of gears and even irregular ""creep-then-jump"" (or ""stick-slip"") motion or expulsion of gears; long gear-gear distances cause weak coupling between gears, slipping and skipping. More importantly, for transmission of rotation at intermediate gear-gear distances, our modeling clearly exhibits the relative roles of several important factors: flexibility of gear arms, axles, and supports, as well as resulting rotational delays, slippages, and thermal and other effects. These studies therefore allow better informed design of future molecular machine components involving motors, gears, axles, etc. Â© 2018 American Chemical Society.",2018,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046696174&doi=10.1021%2facs.jpclett.8b00676&partnerID=40&md5=87f5d1a067f58fca293836729d3b1011,Scopus,Article

Contextually, design methods are developed for exploiting the unique AM capabilities. They largely benefit from the knowledge about peculiarities, constraints and technical performances of the various AM processes and devices. However, while the mechanical properties of objects created with AM are widely studied, there is lack of research on emotional and perceptual aspects. This is of great relevance in the mentioned perspective of employing AM for end-use products. The paper aims to elucidate which perceptual mechanisms are activated when a user observes an object generated with AM instead of traditional technologies. An experiment has involved 43 participants who have evaluated ten pairs of objects, constituted by a commercial product and a replica made with Fused Deposition Modelling. Testers have answered a questionnaire, as well as their visual behavior has been recorded with eye-tracking glasses. Based on results, replicas suffer from poor attractiveness and especially low perceived quality. They have also given rise to more careful exploratory behaviors because they likely require a lengthier examination for testersâ€™ assessment or they arouse curiosity. It can be inferred that Fused Deposition Modelling does not exhibit sufficient accuracy to achieve acceptability with reference to everyday products. Nevertheless, it is also deemed that limited improvements might compensate for the perception of technical unsuitability this technology engenders. This can be verified by repeating the experiment with more sophisticated and precise AM devices.

Specifically, we expect a U-shaped relationship between spatial crowdedness and cluster-level patenting performance. From a perspective of knowledge based view, we argue that the interplay of two underlying mechanisms, i.e. knowledge spillover exploitation and knowledge safeguarding, will lead to this U-shaped relationship.

The number of revealed protein-protein interactions (PPI) is still very limited compared to the available protein sequences of different organisms. Experiment based high-throughput technologies though provide some data about these interactions, those are often fairly noisy. Computational techniques for predicting protein-protein interactions therefore assume significance. 1296 binary fingerprints that encode a combination of structural and geometric properties were developed using the crystallographic data of 15,000 protein complexes in the pdb server. In a case study, these fingerprints were created for proteins implicated in the Type 2 diabetes mellitus disease. The fingerprints were input into a SVM based model for discriminating disease proteins from non disease proteins yielding a classification accuracy of 78.2% (AUC value of 0.78) on an external data set composed of proteins retrieved via text mining of diabetes related literature. A PPI network was constructed and analysed to explore new disease targets. The integrated approach exemplified here has a potential for identifying disease related proteins, functional annotation and other proteomics studies.

However, the impact of financial development on carbon emissions remains controversial and lacks mechanisms investigation covering finance spatial attributes. Relying on China province's data during 2005â€“2019, this paper contributes to the literature by constructing multi-spatial models to investigate how financial geo-density mitigates carbon emission intensity and explore the spatial transmission mechanisms. The results reveal that there is a balance between financial geo-density and carbon emission intensity. The intrinsic mechanisms include: (1) raising financial geo-density is accompanied by the law of marginal diminishing carbon emission intensity tendency; (2) high financial geo-density accelerates technological innovation and industrial structure upgrading, thereby decreasing carbon emission intensity, but drives industrial-scale expansion, thereby increasing carbon emission intensity; and (3) financial institution competition and inter-industry linkage notably influence the relationship between financial geo-density and carbon emission intensity, promoting the emission reduction effect of financial geo-density in accelerating technological innovation and industrial structure upgrading, and suppressing the emission increase effect of financial geo-density in driving industrial expansion. Our findings provide new insights for developing systemic emission reduction policies for employing financial sectors as catch-all and integrating industries and competition.

A review of learning design and program delivery suggests that many online institutions do not take advantage of multiple sociocultural perspectives and uncritically reflect a (Western) dominant-culture curricula design (cf. Hongladarom, 2001; Rogers & Mayes, 2007; Young, 2007). Learning organizations around the world share the challenges and opportunities of developing programs in which adult learners work collaboratively to confront social issues strongly, and the imperative becomes to design the learning experience as one of facilitated constructivist learning through dialogue, or an open-ended, non-dogmatic, and emancipatory discourse (Harris, 2000, p. 39). We assert that instructional designers are rarely taught to explicitly engage in an emancipatory discourse about teaching and learning, although through the decades, theory and practice has consistently reflected the sociocultural and political conditions and contexts in which they have occurred. Instructional design (ID) is not simply a technical methodology to be applied to design situations; ID (Kuhn, 1962) has always been a situated practice, although it has not been explored or described in this way. For example, Hongladarom (2001) argues that because the Internet bears the American stamp of the culture of its origin, values such as liberalism, egalitarianism, individualism, and competitiveness are well embedded in both the technology and the nature of the communication enabled by it. While there is evidence that instructional designers have been pivotal to the growth and success of online offerings in higher education (Bates, 2005), critical theorists have described their products and environments as prescriptive, restrictive, and reductionist, due in no small way to the culture they have acquired within their areas of study that include systems and cognitivist views of learning. However, a discourse is emerging about the actual practice of instructional designers, characterizing it as situated and embedded in context (cf. Garrison, 1993; Visscher-Voerman & Gustafson, 2004). Similarly, a lively conversation about ID theory is happening, with some challenging us to rethink the discipline from an agentic viewpoint using predominantly postmodern methodologies, and others challenging postmodern views and calling for ID to be public with its discourse and about its warrants and claims as a scientific venture (cf. Evans, 2011; Yanchar & Spackman, 2012). We challenge the grand narrative that ID is a scientific domain immune to its sociocultural, geopolitical and economic contexts. We will show that instructional design has always been informed by the social movements to which it responds, by placing research on learning and theory building, applications of ID theory and development of models, and implications for distance education practice, on a temporal and sociopolitical timeline that illustrates how sensitive ID has been to social, cultural, political and economic currents. We argue that designers of distance education environments should be familiar with the history that has shaped their field and, going forward, be able to critically design within relevant sociocultural frameworks.",2019,,WOS,Conference Paper

Despite the motivations and acceptance of BIM within Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC), this promise seems to be hampered by less consideration of environmental factors which might also impact BIM adoption for refurbishment projects. The aim of this study is to empirically examine the potential environmental factors that influence refurbishment stakeholders' attitude or decision to adopt BIM by conducting structural equation modelling. This study describes an empirical testing of a structural model of environmental factors that influence decisions to adopt BIM for refurbishment of complex building. The study is based on response of 105 New Zealand construction professional who have participated in refurbishment project and have BIM experience. Several factors were identified and developed, and a final path model was determined that fit the data best. Overall, we find strong support for policies predicting the attitude towards BIM adoption, including having impact on information sharing, retrofit tools, culture of organisation and client expectations.

Frugal innovation shows itself as a new approach to technological solutions focused on solving local problems in emerging markets. Frugal innovation can be considered as a summarized concept encompassing other concepts related to low costs innovations in resource-scarce environments, according to Bhatti and Ventresca (2013), Brem and Wolfram (2014), and Hossain (2018). For this exploratory and cross-sectional research, data was collected in September 2018 through questionnaire application to 25 small industrial entrepreneurs from a selected universe of 80 entrepreneurs in the state of Alagoas. The data was made available for this research by the Federation of Industries of Alagoas (FIEA). Descriptive statistics and multidimensional scaling were used to capture the characteristics and perception of these entrepreneurs about: (a) target market; (b) product strategy; (c) the perception of the entrepreneur concerning their product. The main findings show that the companies surveyed do not perceive the low-income customer in the specific market in which they operate, considering that about 2/3 of the surveyed companies expressed that they supply the upper and middle classes market and that they do not have to be engaged in solving emerging problems of the lower-class market. From the perception map, a methodology called Enterprise Positioning Matrix was developed that shows qualified business standards and practices from the quadrants of the perception map. The matrix shows four general characteristics developed by the companies: technological software; technological differentiation; technological hardware; local adaptation. The contribution of this research to the knowledge field of frugal innovation is to enlighten why not all companies in the context of scarcity develop solutions oriented to the local market conditions. So, the contribution that comes up with this research can facilitate to emerge new methodologies and business-oriented solutions to develop and manage frugal innovation capabilities.

Opening up to new idea sources may provide a solution. Incumbent companies, however, often suffer from the tendency to reject radical ideas from unusual sources. This study investigates how social integration mechanisms (SIMs; coordination, socialisation, and systems mechanisms) influence an incumbent steel companyâ€™s absorptive capacity (AC). A micro-level analysis of two radical ideas from unusual sources contributes to AC and radical innovation literatures by exploring relationships between SIMs and four AC capabilities (acquisition, assimilation, transformation, and exploitation). The findings suggest that AC capabilities are context-specific with respect to innovation novelty and idea source. The results emphasise the negative sides of socialisation and formalisation mechanisms, and the positive effects of coordination mechanisms on the AC capabilities in such high uncertainty contexts.

A wide variety of digital technologies such as blockchain, 3D printing, cyber-physical systems, or big data also diverges the applications of digital technologies in circular business models. Given heterogeneous attributes of circular business models and digital technologies, the selections of digital technologies and circular business models might be highly distinctive within and between sectorial contexts. This paper examines digital circular business models in the context of the fashion industry and its multiple actors. This industry as the worldâ€™s second polluting industry requires an urgent circular economy (CE) transition with less resource consumption, lower waste emissions and a more stable economy. Design/methodology/approach: An inductive, exploratory multiple-case study method is employed to investigate the ten cases of different sized fashion companies (i.e. large, small medium-sized firm (SME) and startup firms). The comparison across cases is conducted to understand fashion firms' distinct behaviours in adopting various digital circular economy strategies. Findings: The paper presents three archetypes of digital-based circular business models in the fashion industry: the blockchain-based supply chain model, the service-based model and the pull demand-driven model. Besides incremental innovations, the radical business model and digital innovations as presented in the pull demand-driven model may be crucial to the fashion circular economy transition. The pull demandâ€“driven model may shift the economy from scales to scopes, change the whole process of how the fashion items are forecasted, produced, and used, and reform consumer behaviours. The paths of adopting digital fashion circular business models are also different among large, SMEs and startup fashion firms. Practical implications: The study provides business managers with empirical insights on how circular business models (CBMs) should be chosen according to intrinsic business capacities, technological competences and CE strategies. The emerging trends of new fashion markets (e.g. rental, subscription) and consumers' sustainable awareness should be not be neglected. Moreover, besides adopting recycling and reuse strategies, large fashion incumbents consider collaborating with other technology suppliers and startup companies to incubate more radical innovations. Social implications: Appropriate policies and regulations should be enacted to enable the digital CE transition. Market patterns and consumer acceptances are considered highly challenging to these digital fashion models. A balanced policy on both the demand and supply sides are suggested. The one-side policy may fail CBMs that entail an upside-down collaboration of both producers and consumers. Moreover, it is perhaps time to rethink how to reduce unnecessary new demand rather than repeatedly producing and recycling. Originality/value: The pace of CE research is lagging far behind the accelerating environmental contamination by the fashion industry. The study aims to narrow the gap between theory and practice to harmonise fashion firms' orchestration and accelerate the transition of the fashion industry towards the CE. This study examines diverse types of digital technologies in different circular business models in a homogeneous context of the fashion industry with heterogeneous firm types.

(2017),"Reviews, action and learning on change management for ecodesign transition",JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,,10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.09.009,"Corporate sustainability, which has become essential to most companies in the last decades, stipulates that environmental requirements should be incorporated into diverse business processes. To effectively integrate environmental aspects into product innovation processes, companies might have to significantly change some of the practices and habits of all the stakeholders involved and of the organisation. To complement the extensive literature on the (technical) hard side of ecodesign, this article explores the promising soft side, which considers company culture and human factors, by a multiple step literature review associated with a longitudinal action research in a large cosmetics company. Although a consistent prescriptive change model is still lacking in ecodesign literature, a strong convergence and complementarity is observed between the previous conclusions on ecodesign integration models and the emerging Transition Management approach designed for the sustainability issues faced by organisations. As a result, an ecodesign transition framework is proposed by combining a three-level systemic approach, considering both top-down planning and bottom-up innovation, with new types of interaction and dynamic cycles of action and learning, with a deep stakeholder management. This new framework was developed and positively applied to the company in a five-year experience to face the complex transition process, thus advancing the knowledge from social science for innovation and sustainability management challenges. Such approach could positively address change management issues and help companies evolve toward a more effective sustainable product innovation process, in the context of evolving business management practices that require progressive change and more human-based strategies.

This research systematically studies the influence mechanism of haze pollution from a new perspective of urban innovation efficiency. We use a generalised space two-stage least squares method to analyse the correlation between urban innovation efficiency and haze pollution. The periodic and regional influences of urban innovation efficiency on haze pollution is explored using a threshold regression model. Through the mediating effect model, we accurately identify the transmission mechanism of urban innovation efficiency affecting haze pollution. The results show a significant inverted 'U' relationship between improvement of urban innovation efficiency and haze pollution. The regional innovation activities of innovative cities differ greatly from those of non-innovative cities. The effect of innovation efficiency improvement in innovative cities on haze governance is better than that of non-innovative pilot cities. In eastern cities with a higher level of economic development, the improvement of innovation efficiency has a stronger impact on haze governance.

This study used data including inter- city patent transfer from China Intellectual Property Office for 2017 and 2018 to explore the technology-introduction pattern of cities in China from the perspective of technology relatedness and complexity, using Gephi, ArcGIS, and Stata. This study hypothesized that: 1) cities tend to introduce technologies highly related to local knowledge structure; 2) the more complex a technology is, the less opportunity that cities will introduce it; and 3) the relatedness of a technology will mitigate the effect of its complexity on technology transfer. Based on the average relatedness and average complexity of technologies introduced in each city, this study identified four technology-introduction patterns, which are ""high relatedness and high complexity"", ""low relatedness and high complexity"", ""low relatedness and low complexity"", and ""high relatedness and low complexity"". Furthermore, unique mechanisms of change exist for different technologyintroduction patterns. This study found that the complexity of introduced technologies increases with the economic development stage of the city, while the relatedness of that displays an inverse U-shaped mode. Hence, we divided technology introduction into three stages according to the level of urban development: 1) the learning stage dominated by low relatedness, 2) the reinforcing stage dominated by the increase in relatedness, and 3) the leaping stage dominated by diversification into unfamiliar technology fields. The empirical results show that in general, the increase in technological relatedness and the decrease in complexity of a technology will promote cities to introduce the technology, and the increase in relatedness will encourage cities to introduce more complex technology in that field. Additionally, the mechanism of change was tested through regression by groupsâ€”cities were sorted into four groups by their GDP per capita and population density, then we performed regression on technological relatedness and complexity respectively, which shows that the coefficient of relatedness lost significance in the most developed 25% cities, while it remained robust in the other three groups. The coefficient of complexity similarly lost significance in the most developed 50% cities. These results jointly verify the hypothesis of three technology- introduction stages. This study analyzed the pattern of technologyintroduction empirically, stressing on the importance of relatedness and complexity in innovation research, which offers a grounded reference for guiding the innovation development path of cities.

To support farmers in improving yields and organic agriculture systems, there is a need to improve how knowledge is shared. There is an established culture of sharing ideas, successes and failures in farming. The internet and information technologies open-up new opportunities for knowledge exchange involving farmers, researchers, advisors and other practitioners. The OK-Net Arable brought together practitioners from regional Farmer Innovation Groups across Europe in a multi-actor project to explore how online knowledge exchange could be improved. Feedback from the groups was obtained for 35 â€˜toolsâ€™, defined as end-user materials, such as technical guides, videos and websites informing about practices in organic agriculture. The groups also selected one practice to test on farms, sharing their experiences with others through workshops, exchange visits and through videos. Farmers valued the same key elements in face-to-face exchanges (workshops and visits) as in online materials. These were the opportunity for visual observation, deeper understanding of the context in which a practice was being tried and details about what worked and what did not work. Videos, decision support tools and social mediaÂ can provide useful mechanisms for taking knowledge exchange online,Â enablingÂ farmers and researchers to share experiences andÂ practical implications. Visual information,Â economics,Â details of the context, successes and failures wereÂ considered to be critical factors in good knowledge exchange tools.Â Online platforms and forums should not be expected to replace but rather to complement face to face knowledge exchange in improving organic farming.

Recent research identifies how integration strategies enable individual projects to break from this trap, but much less is known about potential strategic action of firms to enable systemic innovation. To explore this, a longitudinal comparative case study examines how three entrepreneurial firms - DPR construction, RAD Urban, and Project Frog - in the San Francisco Bay Area describe their own strategic evolution and restructuring of firm boundaries over the past five years to enable greater adoption of digital manufacturing. Each firm has developed a different approach - relational, project-based spinoff; vertical integration; or digital systems integration. Benefits and challenges are identified for each. The approaches are theorized as a form of strategic mirror-breaking intended to redefine the current paradigm of knowledge and task dependencies. They enable the firms to develop products with new system architectures and access more opportunities for innovation in digitally-enabled manufacturing. The paper concludes with discussion of how the identification and characterization of strategies for mirror-breaking enriches understanding of integration for systemic innovation in construction at the firm level. The paper identifies common themes for digitally-enabled manufacturing including the limitations of the current industry structure, the emergence of new hybrid positions, and the opportunity for platforms to provide longitudinal integration.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01446193.2019.1656814,WOS,Journal

Rather than focusing on the implementation of market-incentive environmental policies in developed countries, we study the effect of the implementation of market-incentive environmental policies on the efficiency of carbon emissions in developing countries, which is generally ignored by frontiers researches. Based on panel data of 282 cities at prefecture-level and above in China from 2007 to 2017, we first adopt the non-radial distance function (NDDF) and global DEA model to measure the carbon emission efficiency of China's cities. Then we take the Chinese carbon emission trading pilot as a quasi-natural experiment and explore the impact of carbon emission trading policy on carbon emission efficiency based on DID method. And the mechanisms are analyzed through the mediation effect model. It is found that the carbon emission rights trading policy can significantly improve the carbon emission efficiency of the pilot cities, and it mainly plays a role through three channels: technological progress effect, green innovation effect and energy consumption structure optimization effect. The heterogeneity test results show that for resource-based cities and cities with a higher degree of marketization, the carbon emission trading policy has a more obvious effect on improving carbon emission efficiency.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenrg.2021.793601,WOS,Journal

Design/methodology/approach Data were collected among knowledge workers working no less than 1 year in three high-tech enterprises in Henan Province, China. The investigation was conducted with the cooperation from the human resource departments of the selected enterprises from August to October 2014. To minimize potential common method bias, the authors adopted a cross-lagged design with a time gap of four months. The statistical methods included descriptive statistics, structural equation modeling (SEM) and bootstrap analysis. Findings The results showed: leadership styles significantly influenced employees' psychological capital and work engagement; specifically, transformational and transactional leadership positively predicted employees' psychological capital and work engagement; compared with transactional leadership, transformational leadership had stronger predictive power to employees' psychological capital and work engagement; employees' psychological capital positively predicted their work engagement; and employees' psychological capital acts as partial mediator between leadership styles and employees' work engagement. Originality/value Although a body of studies have shown that leadership is an important factor influencing employees' work attitude and outcomes, it is only in recent years that the effect mechanism of leadership becomes a hot subject in organizational behavior and management fields. As for leadership styles, in general, most research concerned transformational leadership, rather than transactional leadership and only a little of research compared the effects of transformational leadership and transactional leadership on employees' work outcomes. In terms of outcomes of leadership, as noted earlier, the previous research mainly explored job performance, job satisfaction, innovation behavior, job burnout and so on. Regarding the effect of leadership styles on employees' work engagement, in spite of more and more supportive evidence of the link between transformational leadership and work engagement, few studies examined the relationship between transactional leadership and work engagement. What's more, to the best of our knowledge, till now, no empirical research has explored the internal mechanism of this effect from the perspective of psychological capital. Therefore, the present study is a breakthrough for the direct model of leadership styles and employees' engagement, theoretically bridges the research gap and contributes to the existing literature by presenting a new picture of leadership behavior effect mechanism.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/CMS-04-2017-0108,WOS,Journal

(2020),A repositioning organizational knowledge dynamics by functional upgrading and downgrading strategy in global value chain,JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT,,10.1016/j.intman.2020.100795,"Small to medium enterprises (SMEs) are often marked by limited resources, a high dependence on others, and a scope of business that gets narrower as they seek to adapt to the current dynamic and knowledge-intensive context. Additionally, in their relationship with multinational enterprises (MNEs), SMEs are driven to a continuous specialization of their knowledge and technological resource bases. They so source global knowledge by positioning along a global value chain of those MNES. Especially SMEs employ a repositioning organizational knowledge dynamics by functional upgrading and downgrading strategy. In order to address the query on dynamic capabilities in knowledge management (KM) in different inter-organizational collaborations in the global value chain, this study shows that the choice between functional upgrading or downgrading can determine a more effective cross-innovation strategy which enables SMEs to exploit external paths to the market by revealing or selling their ideas, knowledge and technologies. Such strategies can reveal opportunities for SMEs to increase their network to find an optimum position in the market. SMEs, in turn, become more specialised in their offerings, moving up or down the global value chain, leveraging on a combination of dynamic and technological capabilities along with high degree of involvement in knowledge management process. This scenario is investigated through the study of 532 European knowledge-intensive SMEs via structural equation modelling. Hence, results offer relevant implications for policy-makers and SMEs managers in better employing the organizational ambidexterity for the repositioning strategy in the global value chain.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.intman.2020.100795,WOS,Journal

Within this mission perspective, growing attention is given to learning in action. This paper aims at (i) conceptualizing a methodological framework for complex project evaluation within the context of the Triple-Loop Learning mechanism and (ii) showing its application in a European project as well as including the toolbox developed in coherence with the elaborated framework. It does so by looking at the case of an ongoing Horizon 2020 project aiming to develop language-oriented technologies supporting the inclusion of migrants in Europe. In particular, the paper looks at Triple-Loop Learning as pushed by the reflection on three dimensions: the what, the how, and the why of collective actions in complex projects. The consequent learning process is expected to have transformational potentials at the individual, institutional/organizational, and (in the long term) up to the societal scale. By exploring the opportunities offered by the evaluation tools in the easyRights project, the study highlights the potential of nurturing a wider, arguably neglected as yet, learning space for understanding, engaging, and transforming real contexts and thus developing more effective contribution to the needed transition.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13042343,WOS,Journal

This paper presents the project objectives and the initial results of the detailed design of atmospheric entry missions based on the applications of advanced thermal protection systems (TPS) implementing inflatable heat shields (flexible TPS and inflatable structures), according to aerothermodynamics constraints for future in-orbit demonstration. Placing the future IOD mission in the context of ongoing and future efforts in the European context is also one of the project goals. Two key applications, Mars Robotic Exploration and Reusable Small Launchers Upper Stages, have been identified. For the Mars Application, the robotic exploration mission class resulted in a 10 m diameter Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (HIAD) class, combined with Supersonic Retro-Propulsion (SRP, activated about Mach 2.3) to deliver about 2800 kg of payload at MOLA (Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter) +2 km. For the Earth Application, the VEGA upper stage (AVUM) has been selected as baseline case study. The current mission foresees a deorbiting from Sun Synchronous Orbit, a controlled entry phase (Ballistic Coefficient of about 30 kg/m2) and combines the use of a HIAD (4.5m diameter class) with parachutes and parafoil for MidAir-Capturing (MAR) with a helicopter. Beyond feasibility of the entry mission phase and system design with an inflated IAD, integration aspects have a key impact in the specific design solutions adopted, due to the nature of an inflatable heatshield. For both considered application cases feasible architectures are developed responding to the challenge of integrating the HIAD into the system in compliance with geometric and functional requirements. While the HIAD in folded state prior to inflation must fit in the available volume, it has limitations with respect to the density imposing a minimum cross section of the stowage volume. Simultaneously requirements with respect to the centre of gravity position during re-entry with an inflated HIAD must be respected for stability and controllability reasons. Other architectural considerations such as payload integration for the application on a launcher upper stage must be considered. Finally, heat loads constraints are examined for the trajectory and TPS deign choices due to important fluid-structure interactions.

With increasing dissemination, AM confronts logistics service providers (LSPs) with the question of how they should adapt their business model to the threats and opportunities that come with the emerging digital technologies. We structure the AM activities of LSPs and develop a deep understanding of their resulting business model dynamics. For this exploratory purpose, this study develops a taxonomy and performs a cluster analysis to present six clusters of how LSPs approach AM today. The six profiles include LSPs that reactively monitor AM or, in contrast, proactively leverage AM for their internal operations and the development of new services for their external customers. Among them, four profiles entail fundamental changes to the traditional business models of LSPs. We find that these LSPs oftentimes continue to rely on their traditional analog service strengths to offer integrated service bundles of AM and logistics solutions. They bridge their lack of specific resources by strategic alliances with AM experts. Only a few LSPs have started severing ties to their traditional businesses to develop digitally dominated, platform-based AM services that require different resources. Overall, the comprehensive picture of AM activities enables us to contribute to the knowledge of how LSPs navigate in the digital age and to the nexus of business model dynamics and emerging technologies. We propose a set of propositions and support practitioners in analyzing and designing AM activities.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2022.108521,WOS,Journal

Drawing on the concepts of organisational agility and absorptive capacity with transaction cost theory, this studyâ€™s goal is to investigate factors affecting the adoption of an Open Innovation (OI) orientation in Thai SMEs. Using data from 214 SMEs in Thailand, structural equation modelling validated the model and analysed the proposed hypotheses. The results show that organisational agility, economic and financial readiness and absorptive capacity relate positively to OI adoption and innovation performance. Organisational agility (b = 0.553) had the greatest influence on OI adoption, then economic and financial readiness (b = 0.405) and absorptive capacity (b = 0.387) followed. The results of mediation analysis also reveal that OI adoption partially mediates the effects of organisational agility and absorptive capacity on innovation performance. Our study provides a trailblazing empirical analysis of the major factors influencing SMEsâ€™ OI adoption and performance, extending knowledge of OI adoption by SMEs in emerging economies. The paper proposes a holistic framework for examining SMEsâ€™ OI adoption and performance, through the integration of organisational agility, absorptive capacity and transaction-cost concepts.

This study seeks to provide an innovative framework to facilitate the understanding of spatially and temporally varying impacts of multiple contexts on individuals' travel modes using GIS and machine learning techniques. It adopts machine learning techniques to create likelihood maps to predict the spatiotemporal patterns of individual travel behaviors and uses explanatory tools to explore the spatially and temporally varying impacts. The most notable change at a local level in the spatial dimension was that assaults and offenses involving children turned out to be important in two selected communities in Chicago. Regarding the temporally varying impact, batteries, other offenses, and robberies showed negative associations with the walking prediction to some extent at the afternoon peak (5â€“7:59Â p.m.) during weekdays. The proposed approach will enable meaningful interpretation of complex interactions between multiple environmental factors and individual travel behaviors to suggest policies in urban planning and design.

Before the conceptualization of data lakes, former big data management platforms in the research fields of computational biology and biomedicine could not deal with many practical data management tasks very well. As an effective complement to those previous systems, data lakes were devised to store voluminous, varied, and diversely structured or unstructured data in their native formats, for the sake of various analyses like reporting, modeling, data exploration, knowledge discovery, data visualization, advanced analysis, and machine learning. Due to their intrinsic traits, data lakes are thought to be ideal technologies for processing of hybrid biological resources in the format of text, image, audio, video, and structured tabular data. This paper proposes a method for constructing a practical data lake system for processing multimodal biological data using a prototype system named ProtoDLS, especially from the explainability point of view, which is indispensable to the rigor, transparency, persuasiveness, and trustworthiness of the applications in the field. ProtoDLS adopts a horizontal pipeline to ensure the intra-component explainability factors from data acquisition to data presentation, and a vertical pipeline to ensure the inner-component explainability factors including mathematics, algorithm, execution time, memory consumption, network latency, security, and sampling size. The dual mechanism can ensure the explainability guarantees on the entirety of the data lake system. ProtoDLS proves that a single point of explainability cannot thoroughly expound the cause and effect of the matter from an overall perspective, and adopting a systematic, dynamic, and multisided way of thinking and a system-oriented analysis method is critical when designing a data processing system for biological resources.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2020.553904,WOS,Journal

Taking the 30 provinces of China for example, this paper calculated the tourism carbon emission efficiency based on the super-efficiency Slacks based measure and Data envelope analyse (SBM-DEA) model from 2007 to 2017, and on this basis, defined a compound system that consists of tourism carbon emissions, tourism economic development and tourism regional innovation. Further, the coupling coordination degree model and dynamic degree model were used to explore its spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of balanced development, and this paper distinguished the core influencing factors by Geodetector model. The results showed that (1) during the study period, the tourism carbon emission efficiency showed a reciprocating trend of first rising and then falling, mainly due to the change of pure technical efficiency. (2) The coupling coordination degree developed towards a good trend, while there were significant differences among provinces, showing a gradient distribution pattern of decreasing from east to west. Additionally, (3) the core driving factors varied over time, however, in general, the influence from high to low were as follows: technological innovation, economic development, urbanization, environmental pollution control, and industrial structure.

The importance of spatial thinking in science has received increased attention in academic discussions; however, the intentional practice of teaching spatial thinkingÂ skills is still largely absent from K-12 education. The translation of science into educational practice is challenging for a variety of reasons, including the difficulty â€œtranslatingâ€ research findings into practical applications and limited resources to support its development, implementation, and evaluation. Given these obstacles, one may ask â€œcan spatial thinking be brought to the classroom?â€ In this paper, we argue that in order to effectively move research into the classroom, we must first systematically explore how spatial thinking can be translated into practice. Approach: We present a use-inspired, integrative framework that draws upon planned action and translation science theories, as well as research from cognitive, developmental, educational, and implementation sciences, to guide the infusion of spatial thinking into science curricula. In the Knowledge Translation Framework (KTF), translation is conceived as a multistage process, proceeding through seven stages: (1) the identification of relevant disciplinary and contextual knowledge, (2) the synthesis and translation of knowledge into guidelines to support the infusion of knowledge into the curriculum, (3) the development of tools to support curriculum development, implementation, and track the translation process, (4) the iterative development and refinement of the spatially-enhancedÂ curriculum, (5) the creation of an analysis plan to evaluate the impact of the spatial enhancements and other contextual features on learning, (6) the development and implementation of an intervention plan, and (7) the evaluation of the intervention. Conclusion: The KTF is a use-inspired, integrative framework that unpacks the translation process and offers practical guidance on how a team may synthesize scientific and contextual knowledge, infuse it into a curriculum, and evaluate its impact in ways that will yield scientific understanding and practical knowledge. We also provide illustrative examples of how this approach was used to spatially enhance an elementary science curriculum.

Educational applications are an important agenda among the recent developments. Most related studies focused on the VR content design for course delivery. The physical learning space, where the VR devices and its related equipment are installed, is also a critical factor in developing such type of courses. However, current design of VR-aided learning spaces is still lack of a design strategy that is systematic, user-centered, and service-driven. This project investigates the potential of using Service Design (SD) methods to design a teaching-oriented VR Laboratory for secondary education. We had completed a full SD development cycle that included the four stages, namely Exploration, Creation, Reflection, and Implementation. The SD approach ensured a user-centered design process and considered the interests of multiple stakeholders. The proposed design was then physically implemented at a local school. Till the writing of this paper, the space has served more than 2,000 students. Judging by the regular use and the feedbacks collected from the semi-structured interview, we find the user-centered and co-creative characteristics of SD serve well to designing such a learning space. It is expected that the work can provide practical insights to the related design practitioners by demonstrating how the proposed deign approach facilitate the integration of emerging technologies such as VR within an educational environment.

The salinity mapping approaches in Central Asia are undertaken through field sampling and laboratory analysis, which is a time consuming process. As a consequence, salinity maps are not available on time to estimate water requirements to cope with varying levels of soil salinity. Reducing the time lag between assessment and delivery of such maps would enable authorities to determine in advance appropriate water volumes for leaching the salts before and during the growing season. Research initiated in Uzbekistan context explored transdisciplinary and participatory approach to innovation development with local stakeholders. As one of the innovations, an electromagnetic induction meter (EM), a tool for rapid salinity assessment, was chosen and jointly with local salinity mapping related institutions tested, validated, and local capacities for its use developed. This paper redraws this process of innovation-focused stakeholder interaction and transdisciplinary research and discusses it with reference to ongoing debates on participatory and/or transdisciplinary innovation research. The existence of strong path dependencies within implementation oriented organizations could be observed, meaning that the innovation demands many changes to the existing system. Furthermore, the encountered challenges of participatory, transdisciplinary research in the hierarchically shaped setting of post-soviet Uzbekistan are illustrated in selected qualitative field notes and assessed. For improved joint learning and research in a transdisciplinary team, feedback cycles of mutual learning and critical reflection of how to theoretically and practically work in a transdisciplinary manner turned out to be crucial and not to be underestimated.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10020208,WOS,Journal

Focusing primarily on the developing world, this paper explores how the large volumes of digital information, increasingly available in these contexts, can help decision-makers better address problems as big as poverty, illness, conflict, migration, corruption, natural disasters, climate change, and pollution, among other areas. This paper argues that the information vacuum that still exists in many developing countries makes the potential for impact from big data much greater in these contexts. Through a series of case studies, the authors demonstrate how big data can be used to address pressing social and environmental challenges in developing countries. The authors present research questions that could not have been addressed in the absence of dramatic recent increases in data volume, variety, and velocity. They then extrapolate from these questions, and discuss the nature of the technological changes that now allow decision-makers in developing countries to leapfrog from data poverty to big data, and permit innovative solutions to the aforementioned challenges. The authors emphasize the importance of looking beyond the current focus, in the literature, on storing, analyzing, and creating commercial value from big data. Instead, they point to the importance of innovativeness in identifying, integrating, disseminating, and applying new sources of data to execute actions that in turn generate product, service, process, and business model innovations that are impactful due to big data.

Further, scholars have highlighted the necessity of examining TMS dimensions (i.e., specialization, credibility, and coordination) due to their theoretical distinction. Based on TMS literature and the organizational learning perspective, this study investigates how TMS dimensions relate to knowledge transfer (i.e., a subprocess of team learning), thereby influencing team performance in real organizations. We also proposed the mediating effect of knowledge transfer. The research model was tested through a field survey of 61 Chinese knowledge teams from various industries and companies. Research findings demonstrated that the associations of specialization and credibility with knowledge transfer were more significant than that of coordination. Moreover, knowledge transfer predicted the variation in team performance and fully mediated the effect of specialization and credibility on team performance. Our research findings advance the current understanding of the underlying mechanism of the TMSâ€“team performance relationship and provide implications for academics and practitioners.

Empirical data at archaeological timescales are uniquely well suited to tracking rates of cultural change, detecting phylogenetic signals among groups of artefacts, and recognizing long-run effects of distinct cultural transmission mechanisms. Nonetheless, these are still relatively infrequent subjects of archaeological analysis and archaeology's potential to help advance our understanding of cultural evolution has thus far been largely unrealized. Cultural evolutionary models developed in other fields have been used to interpret patterns identified in archaeological records, which in turn provides independent tests of these models' predictions, as demonstrated here through a study of late Prehistoric stone projectile points from the US Southwest. These tests may not be straightforward, though, because archaeological data are complex, often representing events aggregated over many years (or centuries or millennia), while processes thought to drive cultural evolution (e.g. biased learning) operate on much shorter timescales. To fulfil archaeology's potential, we should continue to develop models specifically tailored to archaeological circumstances, and explore ways to incorporate the rich contextual data produced by archaeological research.

This research aims at creating a comprehensive model of migration determinants taking into account four dimensions: economic, social, cultural, and digital. A path model consisting of these dimensions was created and estimated through partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The PLS-path model was applied to Romanian migration flows to 21 EU member states during 2007-2017. The findings indicate that social and technological developments have significant impacts on migration flows and that digital distance has a full mediation effect on the relationship between cultural distance and migration flows.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pirs.12639,WOS,Journal

To capitalize on successful innovative instruments, it is essential that these are reused. However, reuse can be problematic in project-based public client organizations. This paper aims to apply the ambidexterity concept of integration mechanisms to examine how such reuse can be facilitated. Design/methodology/approach An initial framework is developed to conceptualize and contextualize the ambidexterity integration mechanism for the procurement function of a multi-project public client. Concluding that, in this situation, an organizational procedure is an appropriate interpretation of the integration mechanism, a design science project is carried out to develop and implement a procedure in a real-life setting. Findings Reconstructed reuse patterns confirm the need to have an actionable integration mechanism implemented. Integration, in the sense of drawing benefits from successful one-off innovative procurement instruments, may fail unnoticed if not organized and deliberately managed. The procedure developed in the design science project demonstrates how such integration can be achieved. Originality/value Although research on ambidexterity has grown exponentially in the past decade, it is yet to be applied in the field of public procurement. Furthermore, the application of design science research is novel in this field of literature.

Crowdsourcing-defined as the usage of a flexible open call to a heterogeneous group of individuals to recruit volunteers for a task -is an emerging scientific model that encourages larger and more outwardly transparent collaborations. While crowdsourcing, particularly through citizen- or community-based science, has been increasing over the last decade in ecological research, it remains infrequently used as a means of generating scientific knowledge in comparison to more traditional approaches. We explored a new implementation of crowdsourcing by using an open call on social media to assess its utility to address fundamental ecological questions. We specifically focused on pervasive challenges in predicting, mitigating, and understanding the consequences of disturbances. In this paper, we briefly review open science concepts and their benefits, and then focus on the new methods we used to generate a scientific publication. We share our approach, lessons learned, and potential pathways forward for expanding open science. Our model is based on the beliefs that social media can be a powerful tool for idea generation and that open collaborative writing processes can enhance scientific outcomes. We structured the project in five phases: (1) draft idea generation, (2) leadership team recruitment and project development, (3) open collaborator recruitment via social media, (4) iterative paper development, and (5) final editing, authorship assignment, and submission by the leadership team. We observed benefits including: facilitating connections between unusual networks of scientists, providing opportunities for early career and underrepresented groups of scientists, and rapid knowledge exchange that generated multidisciplinary ideas. We also identified areas for improvement, highlighting biases in the individuals that self-selected participation and acknowledging remaining barriers to contributing new or incompletely formed ideas into a public document.

Though many techniques have been developed to accommodate thickness in origami, creating 3D models of such thick-origami mechanisms is complex. The time and knowledge required to manually model an origami mechanism can impede the exploration of the design space and creation of robust designs. This work presents data structures based on origami that can be used in the automation of thick-origami mechanism design. These structures are described and an example computer program that implements them is investigated. The program automatically generates all the necessary 3D CAD part models and an assembly model for a user-specified origami crease pattern. Models resulting from the program for several crease patterns are demonstrated with a discussion of the advantages and limitations of the system. With further development of the data structures and program, this framework has the potential to help mitigate some of the barriers to more widespread use of origami-based design.

This study focused on the emerging concept of team ambidexterity. Primary purposes were to consolidate emerging research on ambidexterity within teams and to synthesise antecedent inputs. Design/methodology/approach This study applied a systematic content-based review method to collect articles relevant to enabling ambidexterity within teams. The study integrated relevant studies on ambidexterity and on teams and teamwork. It analysed content through theoretical frameworks of ambidexterity and dynamic capabilities. Findings Team ambidexterity constitutes a distinct and increasingly important organisational concept beyond just supporting firm-level ambidexterity. Team ambidexterity depends on inputs that can include ambidexterity's multilevel, generic mechanisms and additional team-centric inputs specially characterising teams. Practical implications Organisational leaders need insights into the valuable potential of ambidextrous teams that can increase innovation and enable successful adaptation at an operational level for longterm survival and competitive advantage in volatile environments. The study highlights the essential inputs for designing and equipping ambidextrous teams. Originality/value Team ambidexterity research is growing, but so far it has mostly addressed team ambidexterity as a microfoundation supporting firm-level ambidexterity. Existing studies have remained mostly disparate and unorganized. This study appears unique in having identified and synthesised studies most relevant to developing ambidexterity within teams.

The application of deep learning methodology is gaining increasing attentions in processing drug screening data and studying anticancer mechanisms of chemical compounds. In this work, we explored the utilization of convolutional neural network in modeling the anticancer efficacy of small molecules. In particular, we presented a VGG19 model trained on 2D structural formulae to predict the growth-inhibitory effects of compounds against leukemia cell line CCRF-CEM, without any use of chemical descriptors. The model achieved a normalized RMSE of 15.76% on predicting growth inhibition and a Pearson Correlation Coefficient of 0.72 between predicted and experimental data, demonstrating a strong predictive power in this task. Furthermore, we implemented the Layer-wise Relevance Propagation technique to interpret the network and visualize the chemical groups predicted by the model that contribute to toxicity with human-readable representations.Clinical relevance - This work predicts the cytotoxicity of chemical compounds against human leukemic lymphoblast CCRF-CEM cell lines on a continuous scale, which only requires 2D images of the structural formulae of the compounds as inputs. Knowledge in the structure-toxicity relationship of small molecules will potentially increase the hit rate of primary drug screening assays.

Recently, safe reinforcement learning algorithms have been developed to optimize the agent's performance while avoiding violations of safety constraints. However, few studies have addressed the non-stationary disturbances in the environments, which may cause catastrophic outcomes. In this paper, we propose the context-aware safe reinforcement learning (CASRL) method, a meta-learning framework to realize safe adaptation in non-stationary environments. We use a probabilistic latent variable model to achieve fast inference of the posterior environment transition distribution given the context data. Safety constraints are then evaluated with uncertainty-aware trajectory sampling. Prior safety constraints are formulated with domain knowledge to improve safety during exploration. The algorithm is evaluated in realistic safety-critical environments with non-stationary disturbances. Results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms existing baselines in terms of safety and robustness.

By performing a questionnaire investigation with 339 Chinese enterprises, this study adopted both a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) to explore the relationships among digital transformation, ambidextrous innovation, and organizational resilience. The results show that the digital transformation of enterprises helps to improve organizational resilience.

Based on the perspective of dynamic capacity and the theoretical path of â€œdigital transformationâ€”ambidextrous innovationâ€”organizational resilienceâ€, this study constructs a theoretical model to explore a path where digital transformation affects both exploitative innovation and exploratory innovation, and further affects the organizational resilience of enterprises. By performing a questionnaire investigation with 339 Chinese enterprises, this study adopted both a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) to explore the relationships among digital transformation, ambidextrous innovation, and organizational resilience. The results show that the digital transformation of enterprises helps to improve organizational resilience. Additionally, digital transformation has a positive impact on the organizational resilience of enterprises mediated by both exploitative innovation and exploratory innovation. Finally, both exploitative innovation and exploratory innovation of enterprises have a positive impact on organizational resilience, and there is a complementary relationship between exploitative innovation and exploratory innovation. Further qualitative comparative analysis also shows that there are three types of configurations for achieving organizational resilience: digital transformation and exploitative innovation, digital transformation and exploratory innovation, and exploitative innovation and exploratory innovation. The paper is concluded by highlighting the importance of the practical significance for enterprises to effectively carry out digital transformation and further achieve organizational resilience.

The central tenet of this narrative is the economic opportunities rather than challenges arising from the pursuit of environmental sustainability. Our paper synthesises insights from 113 recent scientific articles, dealing with both environmental issues and economic growth, as well as innovation. Our ambition is exploratory in attempting to take stock of heterogeneous contributions across the spectrum of social science. The articles have been reviewed with a focus on six themes, derived from current discussions in economic geography and transition studies: skills, technology, physical resources, markets, institutions and policies. Four major implications emerge from the review. First, green growth requires competences that allow for handling complex, non-routine situations - in both the private and the public sector. Second, technological progress should be directed towards greener technologies, to avoid investments funds being channelled to brown technologies for short-term returns. Third, our knowledge of the opportunities for achieving green growth must base upon a joint assessment of market failures, structural system failures and transformational system failures. Finally, greater attention should be devoted to the geography of green growth processes at different scales.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2019.06.013,WOS,Journal

However, little is known about the typology of dashboard feedback relevant for different learning goals, learners and teachers. While most dashboards and the feedback that they give are based only on learner performance indicators, research shows that effective feedback needs also to be grounded in the regulatory mechanisms underlying learning processes and an awareness of the learner's learning goals. The design artefact presented in this article uses a conceptual model that visualizes the relationships between dashboard design and the learning sciences to provide cognitive and behavioral process-oriented feedback to learners and teachers to support regulation of learning. A practical case example is given that demonstrates how the ideas presented in the paper can be deployed in the context of a learning dashboard. The case example uses several analytics/visualization techniques based on empirical evidence from earlier research that successfully tested these techniques in various learning contexts.

This article discusses the changes that are needed in research to drive this paradigm shift and to go from a â€œlosses and wasteâ€ situation to a â€œresource and opportunitiesâ€ ambition. The current lines of research aim to maximise the use and value of biomass or organic residues and wastewater and propose new organisational schemes driven by technical innovations. Exploring the pathways to a sustainable future through many domains let us identify five challenges to structure the research efforts and find circular bioeconomy solutions for organic residues and wastewater: (1) proposing innovative processes and integrated multi-process systems; (2) promoting the emergence of multi-scale and cross-sectoral organisations; (3) developing multi-performance evaluation methods, (4) rethinking researchâ€“society intersections, and (5) enhancing researchâ€“legislation interactions. We end by outlining prospects for moving forward past current limitations: beyond increasing knowledge, research will continue its own transition. Our responsibility today is not to think about what we could do for a better world but what we should do to make our ever-changing world even better and more sustainable.

Identifying the Missing Links with A Moderated Mediation Model,PACIFIC ASIA JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS,,10.17705/1pais.14105,"Background: Despite widely implemented, enterprise systems remain an unsettled role in organizational innovation. This study purposes to address the effects of enterprise systems (ES) on firm innovation by adopting resource-based theory and capability building theory to focus on ES-enabled competence, rather than ES investment or implementation. ES-enabled competence is proposed to mediate the effect of ES integration on innovation performance. We further propose that continuous improvement moderates (1) the relationship between ES integration and ES-enabled competence, and (2) the relationship between ES-enabled competence and innovation performance. By examining these effects, we aim to discover how ES enables innovation at operational and strategic levels separately. Method: A survey method is conducted to explore the relationship between enterprise systems (ES) and innovation. Data are collected from manufacturing companies in 10 countries of three regions, i.e., Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the USA, and analyzed by using structural equation modeling technique. Results: We confirm the roles of enterprise systems as a resource and a capability and the effects of these roles on innovation-including the operational outcome, new product development performance, and the strategic one, innovation uniqueness. We demonstrate that continuous improvement moderates the mediation paths, namely ES integration - ES-enabled competence - innovation performance. The moderated mediation effect exists among continuous improvement, ES integration, ES-enabled competence, and innovation uniqueness. Conclusion: This study contributes to the ES and innovation research by uncovering the micro-foundation underlying ES-enabled innovation from a capability-based framework and elaborating the moderating role of continuous improvement in enhancing innovation.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.17705/1pais.14105,WOS,Journal

Companies such as Facebook, Alibaba, and Uber are competing in a new multi-sided platform world; the primary focus of these firms, from their inception, is to provide digital infrastructure, information and technology-intangible assets that enable direct interaction or value creation across platforms by linking different user group and complementors, often at the international level. Building on data drawn from multinational multisided Platform corporations (MMPCs) operating in China, we combine insights from internalization theory and network effects in understanding the value creation of such firms. We explore the boundaries of these new breed of MNEs in exploiting firm-specific advantages (FSAs) and in creating new knowledge between headquarters and subsidiaries. The findings suggest that internalization theory needs to shift its focus from the 'boundaries of the firm' to the 'boundaries of the local network'.

The self-study aimed to understand the aesthetic link in the development of being a teacher-researcher. This was a departure from positivist rationality and affirmation of an anthropoforming paradigm that connects research, action, and formation via a transdisciplinary systemic epistemology. The context of this self-study is a relationship between teacher-researchers from one high school and two higher education institutions in the Brazilian northeast. Using a reflective anthropoetic (an opening for ethical and aesthetic creation, critical possibilities and pedagogical reinvention) diary, two physical education teacher-researchers developed a critical friendship in a collaborative self-study process on the complexities of beginning teaching for one of them. We share our learning in a diary with excerpts organized in three lines of thought, or what we call reflective flyovers, regarding: life history, teacher education, and pedagogical practice of being initiated into the teacher-researcher profession. Thematic categories were represented by excerpts from the Ãrvore poem. The three reflective flyovers explored included the teaching knowledge of the teacher-researchers, which in turn converge and diverge, impacting the other, the methodology, and the context of practice. Our critical friendship contributed to the self-study process of initiating into the teacher-researcher profession through interactive and creative communication. This poetic self-study points to different paths of learning and professional growth, increasing the value and impact of using poetry to make sense of research findings.

(2017),Knowledge sharing barriers in software development teams: a multiple case study in Turkey,KYBERNETES,,10.1108/K-04-2016-0081,"Purpose - Changing customer demands, needs and desires; emerging technologies; and increasing competition among firms force software development teams to develop and then implement new software projects to satisfy their customers and become more competitive in their marketplace. In this respect, knowledge sharing is critical for project success. However, although knowledge sharing among team members has been investigated by many researchers, knowledge sharing barriers among people have rarely been addressed in project teams in general and software development teams in particular. Thus, the purpose of this study is to investigate knowledge sharing barriers in the software development team context and develop solutions that can overcome these barriers. Design/methodology/approach - An exploratory multiple case design was used to explore why software team members in Turkey may be reluctant to share knowledge. In this study, the authors conducted 18 in-depth and on-site semi-structured interviews and then employed content analysis, which uses a set of procedures to make valid inferences from text, to discover knowledge sharing barriers. Findings - By interviewing 18 Turkish project team managers, the authors identified knowledge-, individual- and organization-related knowledge sharing barriers among team members. They also demonstrated solutions for the knowledge sharing hesitation among team members based on the experiences of project team managers. Research limitations/implications - Some methodological limitations exist in this study. Specifically, the generalizability of the sampling limits the study, which was conducted in a specific national context, Turkish firms in general and the Istanbul district in particular. It is important to note that readers should be cautious when generalizing the results to different cultural contexts. In this regard, a Turkish sample involving the Istanbul district, like that of any culturally bound research, imposes some constraints on the interpretation and application of the results. The study was conducted with in-depth interviews of only 18 managers working in seven companies. Also, this study was performed on system development teams. The results should be confirmed with more samples and different project sets. Practical implications - In this study, the authors discover the reasons for knowledge sharing reluctance among team members and some solutions that will eliminate knowledge sharing problems by using case studies. The results show that the reluctance of team members arises from obstacles, which are knowledge-, individual- and organization- related. Also, the conclusions demonstrate that knowledge sharing barriers can be resolved by establishing project leadership, creating a knowledge sharing culture and considering team members' emotions. Originality/value - The present study investigated whether reluctance to share knowledge derives not only from individual barriers but also from organization- and knowledge-related barriers in a project team context. The authors discovered that knowledge sharing barriers can be resolved by establishing project leadership, creating a knowledge sharing culture and considering team members' emotions.",2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/K-04-2016-0081,WOS,Journal

Addressing this challenge, ML models trained from large material datasets that relate structure, properties and function at multiple hierarchical levels have offered new avenues for fast exploration of the design spaces. The performance of a ML-based materials design approach relies on the collection or generation of a large dataset that is properly preprocessed using the domain knowledge of materials science underlying chemical and physical concepts, and a suitable selection of the applied ML model.

A total of 1002 industrial cluster research studies collected from the Web of Science between 1998 to 2019 were used as samples. BibExcel software was used for data cleaning and literature co-citation analysis, and co-occurrence matrix was inserted into SPSS software and Pajek software for exploratory factor analysis and network analysis, respectively. The differences and commonalities of the two results obtained from exploratory factor analysis and network analysis were compared by reading literature abstracts and manuscripts to robustly identify the knowledge base. According to the framework of 2W1H, the knowledge module was integrated into a problem-oriented system to understand the internal logic mechanism of the entire study. The top 41 studies in the citation frequency of each period from 1998 to 2005, 2006 to 2012, and 2013 to 2019 were selected to analyze the keyword co-occurrence in different periods, main theoretical basis, contextual focus, evolution of research topics, and important research trends. The results show that: 1) The knowledge base of industrial clusters can be divided into nine modules: external economics and new economic geography, new industrial district theory, competitive advantage theory, evolutionary economic geography, buzz and pipelines, regional innovation system, new economic sociology, absorptive capacity, and global chains; 2) The knowledge structure of these modules can be reflected through the 2W1H research framework, in which the WHAT part is composed of four modules: external economics, new economic geography, new industrial district theory, competitive advantage theory, and evolutionary economic geography. It answers the questions regarding concept, types and development stages of the cluster. The knowledge base of cluster type research in this part is less, which reflects the lack of corresponding research literature, and therefore this needs to be enriched using typology theory. The part WHY is composed of external economics and this is divided into two modules, i. e., new economic geography and competitive advantage theory, which answer the questions about the causes of cluster and its impact on regional or enterprise competitive advantage. In the 21st century, researchers have paid increasing attention to the causes of urban cultural and creative industry cluster formation. The part HOW is composed of five modules: buzz and pipelines, regional innovation system, new economic sociology, absorptive capacity, and global chains. This part is the most important, and can be categorized into three levels: enterprise, region, and country; 3) Between 1998-2019, the regional innovation system had been the main theoretical source of cluster. Evolutionary economic geography had occupied a significant position between 2006 and 2012 and it tended to blend with the global chain. The important theoretical sources of the three periods were constantly updated and enriched, thereby increasing the degree of integration with management theory. The focused industries of the three periods were more diverse, especially the status of the service industry, and the focus regions were later transferred to emerging markets and underdeveloped markets; innovation and local economic development had always been the core topics of the three periods. From 2006 to 2012, globalization and entrepreneurial activities received more attention. From 2013 to 2019, management theory occupied the main position, as it focused on new topics such as environmental governance and stakeholder management, and paid more attention to social, ecological, and other issues.

Findings Participants had strong online purchase intentions toward snack and imported food, while they had weak online purchase intentions toward fresh food products such as meat, eggs, vegetables, fish and seafood. Two consumer segments were found: online-food-conservative (42 percent) and online-food-pioneer (58 percent). Factor analysis resulted in an adjusted factorial structure of the innovation-adoption characteristics, which was considered more appropriate within the context of Chinese consumers when shopping for food online. Path analysis found that Chinese consumers' attitudes and/or purchase intentions were positively linked to their perceived incentives and negatively associated with their perceived complexity for online food shopping. Originality/value This is the first study to explore consumer segments, consumption psychology (innovation-adoption characteristics) and product preferences related to online food shopping with a sample from China, the largest e-commerce country. The findings can help food producers and marketers to better understand Chinese consumers' online food shopping behaviors in order to meet the needs of consumers and have further success in this major market.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/BFJ-03-2018-0139,WOS,Journal

In order to achieve high performance and low cost, these products require manufacturability and supply chain knowledge to be integrated earlier than usual in the design process. Knowledge-Based Engineering (KBE) applications can potentially fulfil this need by providing a digital Product Model that informs designers about manufacturability aspects and expected performance. This paper explores the currently available digital tools, as well as KBE and its applicability in faÃ§ade design. It is first demonstrated that there is a fundamental gap in state-of-the-art digital tools: rather than integrating design principles and manufacturing constraints, existing and emerging tools continue to focus on single disciplines with no consideration for the actual manufacturing stage. The applicability of KBE is then evaluated by reviewing the current use of this approach in the building and other industries, namely, aerospace and shipbuilding. It is found that, although KBE is rarely used in faÃ§ade design, there are significant opportunities for it to be applied in this sector, due to the similarity in terms of design tasks and priorities with the two other industries reviewed in this paper.

A total of 58 students were selected to participate in 12-week SL Introductory Landscape Design classes in an university located in the middle of Mainland China. The results of the survey indicated that personalization and interdisciplinary have positive relationship to learnersâ€™ creativity in the solid learning settings. Additionally, learnersâ€™ interdisciplinary capacity was a partial mediator rather than complete mediator of personalization and learnersâ€™ creativity.

Published works found that ambidexterity is an effective way to resolve paradoxical tensions, but few in-depth studies have been conducted to explore the innovation paradox of focal firms in the innovation ecosystem from an ambidextrous capability perspective. This paper takes China Spacesat Co., Ltd. as the case to study focal firms' management of innovation paradoxes in the sustainable innovation ecosystem and finds that: (1) Sustainable innovation is an ecosystem in which focal firms' internal functional departments, including the product department, technical center, and Makers' groups, cooperate with external organizations, including component suppliers, scientific research institutes, and government departments, closely and complementarily; (2) In the exploitative and exploratory innovations of complex products, focal firms in the sustainable innovation ecosystem mainly confront three paradoxes: profit drive vs. breakthroughs in the strategic intent of sustainable innovation of the profit-driven model, tight vs. loose coupling of sustainable innovation, and sustainable innovation driven by discipline vs. that by passion; (3) Focal firms in the innovation ecosystem resolve these three innovation paradoxes with structural, contextual, and coordinated ambidextrous capabilities, and build innovation paradox management mechanisms with three steps in sequence, namely by establishing dual sustainable strategic innovation units, strengthening sustainable organizational ties between the internal and external, while co-creating and sharing innovation values, and, finally, promoting the formation and development of their sustainable innovation ecosystem.

In this paper we are describing an assessment model proposed to assess changes in professional practices while shifting to telemedicine. Two dimensions are explored: the care process and the feelings experienced by the involved actors. We proposed a method based on knowledge framework and providing a qualification of the differences about practices and their impacts. Care process is represented through process modeling and helps analyzing practices before and after the introduction of telemedicine. A two dimensions matrix (effects/participants) identifies the impacts of such an operation. This work is performed in the context of a secondary care pilot study for elderly people that implements teleexpertise or teleconsultation. Process analyses highlight important variations according to the institutions and their actual organization of care. The introduction of telemedicine modified the involvement of the care team, lightened the travels for patient and needed reentering of data for health professionals. A matrix evaluation was built in order to ask professionals their experiences. The professional assertions analysis lead to propose 12 criteria highlighting the nature and the challenges emerging with this innovation.

Through the comprehensive quantitative analysis of the development status of the high-tech industry in Hunan province, this paper provides a reference for the development of the high-tech industry in China and the world. Design/methodology/approach This study constructs a comprehensive evaluation index system of regional competitiveness in Hunan province from the five dimensions of innovation, coordination, green, openness and sharing of the new development concept. Through the screening and analysis of relevant economic indicators in Hunan province from 2011 to 2020, the principal component analysis method is used to measure the five development dimensions, verify the hypotheses in the study and finally draw the conclusion. Findings Hunan's high-tech industry is positively correlated with Hunan's regional innovation development competitiveness, regional coordinated development competitiveness, regional green development competitiveness, regional open development competitiveness and regional shared development competitiveness. Among them, the promotion effect on innovation development is the best, followed by the promotion effect on green development, coordinated development and shared development dimension. In contrast, the promotion effect on the open development dimension is relatively weak. Research limitations/implications The statistical data selected in this study have certain timeliness. At the same time, the current economic environment is affected by the new corona pneumonia epidemic, showing specific particularity. In this context, it is bound to cause changes in the impact of high-tech industries on regional competitiveness. In addition, this paper studies the regional competitiveness of Hunan's high-tech industry from a macro perspective. Although relevant studies are conducted from five dimensions, there is a lack of micro-level research. Social implications From five aspects of the new development concept, this study provides suggestions for developing high-tech industries in Hunan province and even China and the path to enhance regional competitiveness.

Design/methodology/approach: Interview and documentary data were gathered from Canadian sport clubs and provincial sport organizations implementing LTAD, an initiative intended to improve the quality of sport programs. Following a critical realist framework, a retroductive grounded theory approach was used to identify themes and structural mechanisms influencing club decisions to adopt. Findings: LTAD adoption generated internal conflict for clubs while creating opportunity for competition with rivals. Resource and institutional pressures both enabled and inhibited innovation. Clubs pursued innovation when resource controllers signaled that increased legitimacy would result. Clubs with capacity to adopt used LTAD as a means to maintain or improve their competitive position. Practical implications: Policies promoting community sport adoption of innovations to improve program quality may create thresholds allowing clubs with capacity to adopt the opportunity to out-perform or eliminate rivals. This may paradoxically result in increased costs and/or diminished access to sport for participants.

Technological innovation has been repeatedly used as a means differentiation in order to achieve a higher enterprise competitiveness. This has led to achievement of great scientific and technical progress. Nevertheless, in the last few decades, this has not prevented some territories from social issues such as poverty, exclusion, inequality, deterioration of environmental conditions and unemployment, among others. All these problems have a high local impact, being here where social innovation importance as a force for potential change is growing. Despite the broad consensus regarding the potential and the positive effects that social innovation has in those territories, there is still considerable debate surrounding how this concept should be defined and what factors contribute to its appearance. There are many variables that have been mentioned in the literature; however, a review of previous works shows that it is an open field for the identification of new ones. As described above, this paper has three main aims: to analyze the state of the art up to now, to give a definition of social innovation and to identify, analyze and weigh those key factors for its emergence in the territories. To this end we have designed a methodology based on a series of qualitative analysis techniques. Firstly, a review of the state of the art has been carried out to obtain a first approximation to the concept of social innovation and determine which elements are decisive in its appearance. Secondly, based on the existing literature and knowing what the problem is, we complete the methodology by designing and conducting semi-structured interviews. We chose this technique because we understand that social innovation is a living and constantly evolving phenomenon. This makes it very useful and allows us to confront the ideas and evidence from our literature review in a pragmatic way. The information gathered from the interviews allow us to identify, in a reliable and empirical way, new key elements to define social innovation. Additionally, the interviews help us to recognize and weigh the existence of new essential factors for the development of social innovation. These interviews have been conducted with a total of 24 agents involved in social innovation processes: managers and directors of centers responsible for promoting social innovation; agents that developed socially innovative initiatives; and scientists and academics who published work in this field. To analyze the content of the 24 interviews, we used the Atlas.ti computer program. This tool helped us analyze the transcripts. In order to explore and interpret the texts we analyzed 24 primary archives, which represent one transcript for each interview carried out. Afterwards, we encoded them. This process is a form of data reduction, since, based on a large volume of information, we managed to segment certain pieces of information (quotes) and label them based on codes. These are the main elements of analysis and they are considered as a system of categories. In our case, each time we have identified a quote, which made reference to the existence of a factor that conditioned the irruption of social innovation or that enunciated characteristics that defined it, we labeled a code-referred to a certain factor related to the content of the quotes-. Once the individual coding and data editing was completed, we organized the codes into families. Specifically, in line with the main purposes of our analysis, in two families: one to collect the codes related to the definition of social innovation and a second to gather those related to its determinant factors. To provide our study with greater depth, it was essential to carry out a statistical analysis of the content that would allow us to know the frequency of appearance of the codes. First, we calculated the absolute frequency of the codes, referred to the number of times a quote was identified with the same code. Nevertheless, to obtain more information about the importance of each one of the codes, we relativized them considering that they had previously been divided into families. Thus, we have obtained the relative frequency by families, which is, the number of times any code is repeated within a family according to the total number of times codes included in that family appear. This contributes directly to know which factors have more strength in the emergence of social innovation, among the ones pointed out by the interviewers. After the performance of the aforementioned analysis, we suggest the following definition of social innovation: Practices or initiatives carried out by the community that, based on the products, services or models they generate, or through the process designed to achieve their objectives, they reach solutions that give a better response, in an alternative and creative way, to social problems or needs. In addition, we point out five key points for the development of social innovation: social and cultural elements; political and institutional support; knowledge and facilitating mechanisms; spatial components and entities; and mechanisms that determine the corporate and social productive structure. These gather 29 factors identified and weighted according to the number of times they were indicated by the interviewees. Therefore, this work, not only points out the key factors of social innovation and the foundations on which they are grouped by theme, but also shows the importance of each underlying determinant according to its absolute and relative frequencies. These frequencies are used as a proxy to weigh the importance of these factors and foundations. This allows to know which ones are more needed and have more weight in the emergence of social innovations. The ten factors with more impact are: the socioeconomic level of the population (0.09532), the existence of strategies and lines of action to develop social innovation (0.08838), the existence of laboratories or centers of social innovation (0.05892), the existence of public funding (0.05892), the existence of social concern (0.05719), the cultural propensity to change (0.05719), knowledge of the local reality (0.05545), knowledge of the opportunities and potential of new means and instruments (0.04506), links encouraging public-private relations (0.04332) and the existence of cooperatives (0.03986). In summary, it should be noted that the recognition of these factors, together with the weighing of their relative importance, represents a considerable innovation with respect to the existing texts. This work has allowed us to verify the suitability of some determining factors that had previously been pointed out in other studies, state new ones that emerged after the investigation, explain the correlation between them and present how important and what role each of them plays to have a beneficial ecosystem for social innovation. This knowledge can be very useful when establishing lines and criteria for the design of prioritization strategies, useful where there are restrictions of a political, organizational or budgetary nature.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.7203/CIRIEC-E.97.14148,WOS,Journal

A wide variety of digital technologies such as blockchain, 3D printing, cyber-physical systems, or big data also diverges the applications of digital technologies in circular business models. Given heterogeneous attributes of circular business models and digital technologies, the selections of digital technologies and circular business models might be highly distinctive within and between sectorial contexts. This paper examines digital circular business models in the context of the fashion industry and its multiple actors. This industry as the world's second polluting industry requires an urgent circular economy (CE) transition with less resource consumption, lower waste emissions and a more stable economy. Design/methodology/approach An inductive, exploratory multiple-case study method is employed to investigate the ten cases of different sized fashion companies (i.e. large, small medium-sized firm (SME) and startup firms). The comparison across cases is conducted to understand fashion firms' distinct behaviours in adopting various digital circular economy strategies. Findings The paper presents three archetypes of digital-based circular business models in the fashion industry: the blockchain-based supply chain model, the service-based model and the pull demand-driven model. Besides incremental innovations, the radical business model and digital innovations as presented in the pull demand-driven model may be crucial to the fashion circular economy transition. The pull demand-driven model may shift the economy from scales to scopes, change the whole process of how the fashion items are forecasted, produced, and used, and reform consumer behaviours. The paths of adopting digital fashion circular business models are also different among large, SMEs and startup fashion firms. Practical implications The study provides business managers with empirical insights on how circular business models (CBMs) should be chosen according to intrinsic business capacities, technological competences and CE strategies. The emerging trends of new fashion markets (e.g. rental, subscription) and consumers' sustainable awareness should be not be neglected. Moreover, besides adopting recycling and reuse strategies, large fashion incumbents consider collaborating with other technology suppliers and startup companies to incubate more radical innovations. Social implications Appropriate policies and regulations should be enacted to enable the digital CE transition. Market patterns and consumer acceptances are considered highly challenging to these digital fashion models. A balanced policy on both the demand and supply sides are suggested. The one-side policy may fail CBMs that entail an upside-down collaboration of both producers and consumers. Moreover, it is perhaps time to rethink how to reduce unnecessary new demand rather than repeatedly producing and recycling. Originality/value The pace of CE research is lagging far behind the accelerating environmental contamination by the fashion industry. The study aims to narrow the gap between theory and practice to harmonise fashion firms' orchestration and accelerate the transition of the fashion industry towards the CE. This study examines diverse types of digital technologies in different circular business models in a homogeneous context of the fashion industry with heterogeneous firm types.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJPPM-12-2020-0683,WOS,Journal

The study was carried out with students who joined Facebook learning community that was created for the Computing I course which was taught with blended learning method. Data were collected from 316 university students by utilizing three self-report instruments: KSB scale, ASE scale (sub-scales: 'social status', 'cognitive applications' and 'technical skills') and classroom community (CC) scale (sub-scales: 'connectedness' and 'learning'). The path analyses with structural equation modeling (SEM) further verified that students' KSB were related to their ASE and SoC in e-learning community. The results of the study revealed that the ASE and SoC of the students positively affect their KSB. And in terms of sub-scales, the connectedness to the community, learning perception in the community, the self efficacy of the students on the cognitive applications in the courses and their social status in the community positively affect KSB.

The results show that intrinsic motivation includes four factors, which are innovation motivation, achievement motivation, emotion motivation and responsibility motivation. The effect of achievement motivation on teaching performance is not significant. Innovation motivation and responsibility motivation have positive influences on teaching performance, while emotion motivation has negative influence on teaching performance. The above results have certain reference value for the management reform of teaching in Chinese application-oriented universities.

Firm-Level Evidence From China,FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH,,10.3389/fenrg.2022.906033,"The green energy structure transition is an effective means to achieve carbon emission reduction and sustainable energy development in the long term. Whether the carbon emissions trading scheme, a typical market-oriented environmental regulation, can realize a green energy structure transition has attracted widespread attention. Rather than focusing on the macro-effects of the carbon emissions trading scheme, this paper explores its effect on green energy structural transition in the power sector, which is a major carbon emitter by consuming non-renewable energy. With the multi-period difference-in-differences method, this study manually collects a panel data set of 103 listed power plants from 2011 to 2020 for a total of 1,030 samples and investigates the effect of the carbon emissions trading scheme on the proportion of clean energy power generation. The corresponding mechanism and heterogeneous effects are also examined. The results reveal: 1) The carbon emissions trading scheme increases the proportion of clean energy power generation significantly. This improvement is achieved by increasing clean energy power generation and decreasing thermal power generation. 2) Power companies to which power plants belong are private-owned and have lower debt-to-asset ratios and higher fixed asset ratios, or in regions with a high development level or strong environmental law enforcement, they are found to be more responsive to carbon emissions trading schemes. 3) Green technological innovation is the primary path for transitioning to a green energy structure, but it is not the only path.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenrg.2022.906033,WOS,Journal

The role of perceived trust, knowledge, and risk",Sustainability (Switzerland),Bangladesh; Emerging market; Knowledge; Liquid milk; Purchase intention; Risk; Security crisis; Trust,10.3390/su10103722,"Until today, inadequate food supply, malnutrition, food adulteration, etc., are still the key concern in developing economies. In order to address these issues of food security crisis, and to stimulate a sustainable supply of liquid milk (LM), a consumer behavior model was created, in which consumers' perceived knowledge, trust and risk were the major catalysts. To shed light on this context, the study examined the effect of consumers' perceived knowledge (PK) on their perceived risk (PR) and trust (in information sources and in the product). Further, the influence of consumers' perceived knowledge, risk, and trust on their attitude and purchase intention (PI) were investigated via an exclusive survey design. The survey was conducted in the urban area of Dhaka and Chittagong, Bangladesh. The sample of 712 households was selected randomly and interviewed using a structured questionnaire. The data were analyzed employing descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation modelling. The results show that during a food security crisis, consumers' perceived knowledge amplifies their perceived risk and their trust in information sources (ISs). During such a period, their perceived knowledge does not induce purchase intention but trust in ISs does. Again, consumers' perceived risk leads to reduced trust in products, and hence in LM, but not reduced trust in ISs. Moreover, a paradoxical influence was found, where consumers' perceived risks had no significant effect on the PI, meaning that they underestimate the risk of purchasing LM. The results also show that when explaining the purchase intention of LM, the effect of 'trust in ISs' was higher than that of their perceived 'trust in the product (LM)' and perceived knowledge.

Many approaches have been raised to suggest a personalized learning path based on the learnerâ€™s career goals; however, most of them use traditional techniques and face the problems of sparse data, cold start, and lack of advisory resultsâ€™ interpretation. In this paper, we address these problems by using Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) which is known as one of approaches of Graph-based models. This approach has emerged as a phenomenon and has not been widely applied in the field of learning path recommendation. We propose a new knowledge graph (KG) architecture for representing entities and their semantic relationships. The main entities identified in the KG are courses, occupations, the units of knowledge, and the relationships are the semantic connections between these entities. In existing KG architectures only exploit the hierarchy of intermediate knowledge units. Whereas, our KG architecture provides a specific classification of these learning objects, and this helps the semantic relationship of the subjects become more unambiguous and connected. Then, we explore and build experiments for our proposed KG architecture by using KGE techniques to prove the effectiveness. The experimental results show that our solution is worth considering and promises to bring a high degree of efficiency in the learning path recommendation system.

(2022),A quantum mechanics-based framework for knowledge-based innovation,Journal of Knowledge Management,Evolution; Knowledge-based innovation; Knowledge-based system; Quantum mechanics; Transition,10.1108/JKM-12-2020-0920,"Purpose: Because the discontinuous and uncertain characteristics of knowledge-based innovation cannot be reasonably interpreted by conventional management approaches, quantum mechanics which begins with uncertainty and concerns with a dynamic process of the complex system, has been exploratorily used in the management field. Although the theoretical new insights are provided by pioneering studies, quantitative research is in short supply. This paper aims to propose a quantum mechanics-based framework for quantitative research, thus extending the application of quantum mechanics in the knowledge management area from a dynamic system evolutionary standpoint. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the similarity comparison between knowledge-based system evolution and atomic motion, the authors construct the atom-like structure of the knowledge-based system and elaborate the evolutionary mechanism of the knowledge-based system, thereby establishing the quantitative model. Apple and Zhongxing Telecom Equipment were selected for an empirical study to demonstrate the usefulness of the models for research on knowledge-based innovation and explore the unique knowledge-based innovation characteristics of the two firms. Findings: First, the transition force of dynamic knowledge shows an inverted U shape; accumulating dynamic knowledge to a moderate degree not only facilitates transforming dynamic knowledge into static knowledge but also balances the relationship between the influence of knowledge force range and dynamic knowledge transformation. Second, existing knowledge is gradually substituted by new knowledge and knowledge density at a high knowledge energy level distinctly increases with a narrower bandwidth. Third, the investment loss is associated with resource configuration, resource utilization and the amount of accumulative dynamic knowledge before investment. Knowledge loss is negatively correlated with the knowledge compatibility coefficient. Research limitations/implications: The authors use the advanced method in quantum mechanics to legitimately unveil the emergence mechanism of knowledge-based innovation. Meanwhile, the authors capture the non-linear transformation relationship of heterogeneous knowledge and expose the change in ways of both investment loss and knowledge loss that cannot be quantified by conventional models. In doing so, the authors not only reveal the principle of qualitative knowledge change but also offer practical implications for developing flexible and targeted innovation strategies. Originality/value: First, by proposing a complete quantum mechanics-based framework, the authors not only supplement the quantitative research contents to knowledge-based innovation literature which proposed calls to conduct research in way of quantum mechanics but also overcome the difficulties of knowledge-based system conceptualization and measurement. Second, the authors reveal the uncertain change of knowledge transformation and measure the loss of investment and knowledge, which contribute to identifying defects of firms in knowledge-based innovation. Third, the authors explore the internal mechanism that led to knowledge-based innovation exhibits non-linear characteristics and capture unique dynamic relationships between different variables which affect the emergence of knowledge-based innovation.

What is the mechanism by which the different leaderships exert different effects on organizational innovation? Design/methodology/approach - To test the hypothesized model, a data set based on 133 MBA part-time students from Tsinghua University and Zhejiang University in China was built, after interviewing several top managers as a pilot study. With the help of SPSS macro, hierarchical regression and bootstrapping analysis, the paper analyzes the effects of two leadership styles on innovation performance, through the mediation mechanism of openness involving open breadth and open depth. Findings - The results indicate that transformational leadership enhances, while transactional leadership reduces, the organizational innovation performance. The openness breadth and openness depth not only mediate the beneficial effect of transformational leadership on innovation, but also mediate the deleterious effect of transactional leadership on innovation. Originality/value - This study empirically explores the different functions of transformational leadership and transactional leadership for leading organizational innovation performance. Furthermore, a new form of organization is an open design or strategy that allows more external knowledge and resources to be absorbed, which is claimed as a new paradigm for organization innovation.

Design/methodology/approach This paper adopts an interpretive and exploratory case study on the business model innovation of Yimu Technology Company Limited (Yimu Tech) from product standardization to customization. Considering that this innovation reflects a successful down-up rather than traditional up-down innovation, this paper focuses on it to explore how the most micro routines affect the whole process of innovation. Almost two years were spent in collecting data from Yimu Tech and in following the innovation through approaches of semi-structured interviews, archival data and observation; the data were analyzed through a five-step process before a framework showing the paradoxical effects was finally set up. Findings This research specifies the construct of organizational routines and promotes a five-dimensional concept covering the organizational, collective and individual levels of an organization. It confirms the interaction between the performative and ostensive aspects of routines, by showing that the ostensive aspect may not only guide tasks performing but also allow multiple changes, and the performative aspect may affect the ostensive aspect through the down-up or up-down path. Also, it finds that routines may paradoxically affect all three phases of innovation, with a strong up-down hindering effect but a weak down-up promoting effect in the preparation phase, a strong down-up promoting effect but a weak hindering effect in the emergence phase and both significant effects in the consolidation phase. Research limitations/implications This research is constrained by several limitations. The set up framework of routines and their paradoxical effects on innovation need a further confirmation in more contexts or organizations; more elements should be considered in exploring the evolution of routines and their effects on innovations; little attention has been paid to the relationship between these two types of effects, conflicting with each other, joining together or working independently. Originality/value The findings offered some valuable insights for further research on organizational routines and organizational innovation and hold important implications for management practices. This research enriched the two-aspect view of routines by constructing a five-dimensional framework; further research studies on routine dynamics by showing the interaction between the performative and ostensive aspects can contribute to the study on effects of organizational routines on innovations by showing how routines promote and hinder innovation simultaneously throughout the whole process.

(2020),Impact of participatory sorghum breeding in Burkina Faso,Agricultural Systems,Agricultural innovation systems; Empowerment; Impact; Participatory research; Plant breeding,10.1016/j.agsy.2019.102775,"An ex post analysis of the impact of research projects related to Participatory Breeding (PB) of sorghum in Burkina Faso was carried out in 2015 and 2016 using the â€œImpressâ€ method developed by CIRAD. The sorghum PB approach emerged in Burkina Faso in the late 1990s as a response to the very low adoption of improved varieties released by the conventional breeding program. This approach represents a paradigm shift from a research approach focused solely on the development of â€œhigh-yielding varietiesâ€, irrespective of the social context in which these varieties are to be used, towards the development of varieties, seed and their dissemination within a multi-stakeholder framework. The present study aims to assess the impact of the sorghum PB program and the activities related to seed production and dissemination carried out in Burkina Faso over a period of 20 years. Detailed mappings of the timeline and the actors that have been involved in the innovation process, as well as the impact pathway, have been established. The causal relationships between outputs, outcomes and impacts have been developed on the basis of 67 impact descriptors provided by research partners and beneficiaries during participatory workshops. Around thirty measurable impact indicators were assessed by means of individual or focus-group interviews and by means of secondary data sources. The three major outputs of the study were: the new improved varieties (IV) resulting from the PB actions; the mini-pack seed strategy; and the new skills acquired by the farmer organizations regarding sorghum improvement and certified seed production. The appropriation of these outputs by the farmer organizations not only brought structure to the experimentation networks, but also ensured the promotion and dissemination of the new varieties, and the establishment of a decentralised certified seed production scheme. One major positive impact was the significant increase in the use of sorghum IVs not only in the villages covered by the program but also in neighbouring areas. The expansion and performance of these new IVs has helped reduce the hunger gap while increasing the revenues of farmers involved in seed production. Furthermore, the research projects helped bring structure to the national seed sector as well as to the certified seed market, where the farmer seed production Unions consolidated by the PB projects now play an important role in the orientation of national legislation. The experimental method of impact assessment used in this analysis explores and makes visible the complex multidimensional and multi-stakeholder processes that have helped shape technological innovation and its impact on development. Such impact assessments can also elucidate the role of research in reinforcing the individual and collective capacities needed for innovating and testing out new technologies, that is, new varieties and seed production practices according to local constraints and/or opportunities.

By exploring how and why the new organizing logic of digital innovation impacts and transforms incumbent firms, the workshop addresses questions from four different areas: (1) Why the new logic of digital innovation triggers a digital transformation in incumbent firms; (2) the drivers of this digital transformation in incumbent firms' immediate environment; (3) how these drivers may under certain conditions alter the structure, strategy, culture, competencies, skills and technology platforms of incumbent firms; (4) the trajectories of digital transformation journeys inside incumbent firms.

Therefore, this study aims to test the association of marketing and financial metrics use and the metric-based orientations of training and compensation, with two key marketing routines - exploitation, i.e. the perfecting of existing activities while allowing for incremental adaptations and exploration or experimentation accompanied by radical adaptation. Design/methodology/approach The study gathers data from 205 managers and uses partial least squares structural equation modeling to test the hypothesized relationships. Findings Marketing metrics encourage both forms of marketing adaptation. Financial metrics use discourages exploration. Market orientation and long-term orientation strengthen (weaken) the positive (negative) relationship between marketing (financial) metrics use and marketing exploration. Metric-based training is more positively associated with both adaptive capabilities than a metric-based compensation orientation, albeit weakly. Research limitations/implications The study's central proposition - that different metrics or metric orientations are associated with distinct types of knowledge, interpretations, mindsets, motivations and cultural contexts - provides a deeper theoretical understanding of the pathways by which a metric emphasis affects marketing adaptation. Practical implications Marketing managers should emphasize marketing metrics and training more than compensation, to promote marketing exploitation/exploration, while exercising caution in overstressing financial metrics given their negative association with exploration. This latter negative relationship can be weakened (as can the positive one between marketing metrics and exploration be strengthened) with increased market orientation and long-term orientation. Originality/value This study addresses the research gap regarding the relationship between metrics as a configurational element of marketing organization and marketing adaptation.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EJM-01-2018-0050,WOS,Journal

Agriculture figures prominently in this quest, being both a major driver and a major threat to global sustainability. Agricultural systems typically have co-evolved with other societal structures-retailers, land management, technology, consumer habits, and environmental and agricultural law-and can therefore well be described as socio-technical regimes in the sense of the sustainability transitions literature. This paper aims to give an overview of the emerging field of governing transitions to sustainability agriculture and the topics and trends covered, focusing on how agricultural transitions are being governed through a variety of actors and at a variety of levels. We conduct a systematic review of 153 articles published before the year 2019. We identify two main perspectives: papers that analyse the status quo in farming practices and reasons for lock-in, and papers that explore potential transition pathways and their governance. Predominantly, papers study (local) niche developments and discuss governance options for upscaling, rather than actual regime change. Seven distinct perspectives emerge from our reading of the selected articles: application of theoretical perspectives from the literature on socio-technical transitions; governance and regulation; knowledge and learning; concrete approaches to reduce the environmental impact of agricultural systems; urbanisation, urban agriculture, and local food networks; the role of agri-food businesses; as well as the role of gender. While a variety of local case studies shows potential for small-scale changes that might be transferable to other regions and higher levels of governance, it generally appears that more integrative, comparative work and perhaps more coherence in conceptual approaches would benefit the currently highly fragmented field.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13020528,WOS,Journal

Although widely recognized among researchers and practitioners, cross-cultural differences in creativity are yet to be comprehensively explored.

Specifically, the theoretical framework depicts the effects of motivational, cognitive and attribution preferences on information processing strategies at every step of the creativity process and outlines how these differences result in a qualitatively different creative outcome. The perspective presented in the paper traces differences in the degree of novelty and usefulness of a creative idea to the information processing strategies that occur at every given step of the creative process.

The authors investigate how the Chinese guanxi is utilized to create and develop service exploitation and exploration activities for adopting non-technological innovations. Design/methodology/approach: This study surveyed 252 Chinese and Taiwanese firms. The results were analyzed through structural equation model. Findings: Relational antecedents of collaborative communication and constructive conflict positively relate to trust, as well as to relationship effectiveness. Constructive conflict positively relates to exploration and exploitation. Relationship effectiveness and trust mediate two relational antecedents to exploitation. Relationship effectiveness crucially mediates two relational antecedents to exploration. Research limitations/implications: Dyadic data would be more desirable to study firm interactions. Practical implications: Chinese society perceives conflict as being detrimental to relationships. Constructive conflict enhances inter-firm trust and relationship effectiveness. Relationship effectiveness, which motivates suppliers to mobilize their guanxi network, mediates the supplierâ€“customer interaction in broadening relationships to produce new services, as well as reinforcing networks to strengthen existing ventures. Originality/value: This study contributes to a relatively under-explored relationship effectiveness area. Chinese suppliers capitalize their guanxi networks to achieve competitive advantages in non-technological innovation.

Unlike lean manufacturing, few studies to date have investigated lean construction in both breadth and depth, especially from the perspective of construction supply chains. The limited understanding of lean construction results in a research problem. This research aims to explore the implementation of lean principles in the context of project-based construction supply chains. It achieves its aim through an empirical investigation in the UK. A combination of quantitative and qualitative methodologies provides this research with validity and reliability. Lean principles are found applicable to both residential building projects and many other types of construction projects. It is also found that lean construction can be enhanced if it synergizes with supply chain collaboration. Another finding is that lean management has a significant impact on project performance. Nowadays, construction pursues best lean practices through both learning from manufacturing and developing its own paths. Similar to manufacturing, more and more construction projects adopt industrialised and standardised production and lean management with supply chain collaboration to become leaner. On the other hand, construction-specific management approaches and information technology (IT) tools are increasingly used in lean construction practices to maximise value and minimise waste.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2019.1566659,WOS,Journal

One of the principal reasons is the capability to reach the motivations that foster us to choose one or another urban transportation systems. It is already feasible to develop solutions to implement and root more efficient and sustainable habits in urban transportation. The present exploratory chapter presents the activities conducted by innovation lab PUSH, with the Italian Ministry of Innovation and Research, for the development and the application of the social innovation project â€œTrafficO2â€ in the city of Palermo, Italy. The project is a technology driven (mobile app) serious game for sustainable urban mobility that tries to foster citizens, through information and tailor-made incentives, to choose low emission means instead of using cars. The aim of the game is to build up a strong and values-driven self-organized community, able to change the actual urban condition without any command and control policies or any structural change. The system has already been tested with the community of students of Palermo University. This chapter shows the results in terms of CO2 reduction and testers engagement.

Geomatics products have been used to identify flood extents and impacts, to inform flood and evacuation models, and as part of emergency response activities. Recent technological advances have provided an opportunity to explore the use of remote sensing further within the context of flood risk management. For example, unmanned aircraft systems have been used to model evacuation routes and post-event to assess the impact of flooding at property level, identify households that would benefit from resilient and resistance measures, and identify the source of flooding. This chapter describes current applications of remote sensing within flood risk management and flood emergency response. The first section discusses the application of remote sensing in flood modeling, flood damage assessment, and vulnerability. The second section reviews how the development of remote sensing technologies has extended the range of their application in flood risk management. The last section captures key considerations for the use of standardized remote sensing data collection approaches to inform flood risk management activities.

In robotics, there are several well developed frameworks for imitation learning or so called learning by demonstration. Two paradigms dominate: Direct Learning (DL) and Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). The former is a simple mechanism where the observed state and action pairs are associated to construct a copy of the action policy of the demonstrator. In the latter, an optimality principle or reward structure is sought that would explain the observed behavior as the optimal solution governed by the optimality principle or the reward function found. In this study, we explore the plausibility of whether some form of IRL mechanism in infants can facilitate imitation learning and understanding of others' behaviours. We propose that infants project the events taking place in the environment into their internal representations through a set of features that evolve during development. We implement this idea on a grid world environment, which can be considered as a simple model for reaching with obstacle avoidance. The observing infant has to imitate the demonstrator's reaching behavior through IRL by using various set of features that correspond to different stages of development. Our simulation results indicate that the U-shape performance change during imitation development observed in infants can be reproduced with the proposed model.

However, there is evidence of limited adoption and utilization. Our objective was to evaluate this gap by exploring U.S. healthcare systemsâ€™ experience in implementing telehealth services in rural hospital emergency departments (TeleED) and by analyzing factors influencing its implementation and sustainability. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 18 key informants from six U.S. healthcare systems (hub sites) that provided TeleED services to 65 rural emergency departments (spoke sites). All used synchronous high-definition video to provide the service. We applied an inductive qualitative analysis approach to identify relevant quotes and themes related to TeleED service uptake facilitators and barriers. Results: We identified three stages of implementation: 1) the start-up stage; 2) the utilization stage; and 3) the sustainment stage. At each stage, we identified emerging factors that can facilitate or impede the process. We categorized these factors into eight domains: 1) strategies; 2) capability; 3) relationships; 4) financials; 5) protocols; 6) environment; 7) service characteristics; and 8) accountability. Conclusions: The implementation of healthcare innovation can be influenced by multiple factors. Our study contributes to the field by highlighting key factors and domains that play roles in specific stages of telehealth operation in rural hospitals. By appreciating and responding to these domains, healthcare systems may achieve more predictable and favorable implementation outcomes. Moreover, we recommend strategies to motivate the diffusion of promising innovations such as telehealth.

Space 4.0 ambitions are to place space at the heart of the successful evolution of Europe and the full implementation of the United Nations Agenda 2030 worldwide. The outcomes of the conference Ã¢â‚¬Å“Space2030 and Space 4.0: synergies for capacity building in the XXI centuryÃ¢â‚¬Â, recently co-organized by the European Space Policy Institute (ESPI) and the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA), with the support of the European Space Agency (ESA), point to the timeliness of a fresh look at the wider perspectives and strategies to be implemented in future space programmes. The paper summarizes these findings and recommendations involving stakeholders and representatives of civil society, mapping out available options and identifying the ideal conditions for their successful implementation. Innovative frameworks, partnerships and collaborations in this ecosystem are explored, posing special attention to improving the dialogue with civil society and other sectors, to make them aware of the potential of space, and to the creation of new mechanisms to identify, collect and process user needs, in order to design, implement and fully exploit future space programmes. In this context, potential synergies between the UN agenda Space2030 and the ESA Space 4.0 strategy are identified, focusing on four thematic priorities of UNISPACE+50: Global partnership in space exploration and innovation; Strengthened space cooperation for global health; International cooperation towards low emission and resilient societies; Capacity building for the twenty first century. Through these themes, the interplay and dependencies amongst key actors are identified, and a special emphasis is placed on future approaches of the diverse groups of stakeholders involved, leveraging the existing space infrastructure, institutions and networks while reinforcing and expanding their scope and effectiveness in ensuring that space becomes an important driver for sustainable development. For example, future integrated services will capture new citizen needs and target sustainable development goals, creating unprecedented opportunities for Europe worldwide. This will be enabled by Copernicus, Galileo and by the emergence of new satcom infrastructures for 5G, serving new markets by providing broadband connectivity to rural areas. Space is therefore increasingly becoming the link among systems of systems, and its enabling function may represent a key element actively contributing to a sustainable future on Earth.

As these aspects have not been sufficiently discussed in the literature, the study objective is to determine (1) the type of CI process being employed, (2) whether the CI scope is limited to competitor analysis or spans a broader business environment and (3) whether the CI process and scope vary depending on organizational CI. Design/methodology/approach An interview was conducted at two types of Japanese companies: one established a CI department to implement CI, whereas the other did not establish a CI department and conducted CI in an ad hoc manner. Multicase studies were performed to examine companies with different organizational structures. Findings The CI scopes included a broad range of factors (e.g. technology, customers, markets, suppliers, economy, society, politics, legislation and regulation), and not only competitor analysis. An established CI department did not guarantee a well-organized CI process. Furthermore, the lack of such a department did not preclude systematic CI processes or activities. Originality/value The authors classified the CI in the companies the authors inspected as either systematic (organized CI) or ad hoc (unorganized CI) methods. The advantages and disadvantages of both are discussed. The authors found the promotion mechanisms in company-wide CI process, which can cause intelligence transfers from CI to absorptive capacity processes.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/AJIM-05-2021-0133,WOS,Journal

Within this context, different kinds of sharing-bicycle programs equipped with new technologies/devices emerge and extend. By comparing two generations of them in Guangzhou (China), this paper explores how new technologies impact existing modes of mobility governance. First, the technical innovations, e.g., app-based bicycle locks and micro-GPS equipment, contribute to liberating emerging private companies from existing governmental regulations based on land control. Second, the adoption of these innovations not only contributes to the accumulation of cultural and symbolic capitals based on a fashionable lifestyle but also links bicycles to personal point-to-point travel data that could be translated to economic capital. Third, the discrepancy between the dispositions of the government and private companies regarding the innovations opens an opportunity for the quick extension of sharing bicycles, which brings both positive and negative consequences on citizens' daily travel and life. The absence of other civic actors in the decision-making process accelerates the negative consequences caused by the profit-driven fast extension of sharing bicycles and the governmental top-down governing logic.

Methods: we performed structural equation modeling using the statistical technique of partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) and post hoc analysis to identify unobserved heterogeneity, with a sample of 256 Brazilian companies from different sectors. Results: the results revealed that the SIS had a strong and significant influence on the innovation of exploitation and exploration. The environmental uncertainty of dynamism moderation was not present in the relationship between SIS and the innovation of exploitation. However, SIS showed a strong and significant influence on innovation of exploration in high levels of dynamism. The existence of unobserved heterogeneity was identified for two segments of the sample, demonstrating a strong path effect between SIS and innovation of exploration and exploitation on the high presence of dynamism in service companies with a size greater than 500 employees.

While traditional SHM practices are based on scheduled and pre-emptive maintenance, the NextGen SHM system, known commonly as Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), has a focus on pro-active condition-based maintenance, forecasting and prognostics â€” a milestone on the trajectory towards Digital Twin technology. In aircraft, particularly defense fighter air platforms, fatigue-critical high-amplitude cyclic behavior is unavoidable, where rapid fatigue life consumption due to an airframe buffet is one of the most problematic phenomena that engineers have encountered throughout the 4th and 5th generation fighter programs. This paper serves as a point-of-reference consolidating a range of machine learning models, under a single benchmark aircraft Multi-Input Single-Output (MISO) loads monitoring problem. Linear regression models, traditional (shallow) artificial neural networks, and deep learning strategies are all explored, where strain sensors are used as inputs to predict representative bending and torsional dynamic (buffet) and quasi-static (maneuver) load spectra on an aircraft wing during transonic buffeting maneuvers. For the benchmark system considered herein, the MISO coherence ranges from high to very weak depending on the load case, hereby providing a unique opportunity to rigorously explore the time-series modeling requirements and make valuable recommendations across a wide range of data-qualities that are likely to be encountered in traditional or modern aircraft data-acquisition systems or, for that matter, in any mechanical systems plagued by fatigue.

The application of this nitrogen-fixing system in sustainable agriculture is usually impeded by incompatible interactions between partners. However, the progressive evolution of rhizobium-legume compatibility remains elusive. In this work, deletions of rhcV encoding a structural component of the type three secretion system allow related Sinorhizobium strains to nodulate a previously incompatible soybean cultivar (Glycine max). These rhcV mutants show low to medium to high symbiotic efficiency on the same cultivated soybean while being indistinguishable on wild soybean plants (Glycine soja). The dual pantranscriptomics reveals nodule-specific activation of core symbiosis genes of Sinorhizobium and Glycine genes associated with genome duplication events along the chronogram. Unexpectedly, symbiotic efficiency is in line with lineage-dependent transcriptional profiles of core pathways which predate the diversification of Fabaceae and Sinorhizobium. This is supported by further physiological and biochemical experiments. Particularly, low-efficiency nodules show disordered antioxidant activity and low-energy status, which restrict nitrogen fixation activity. Collectively, the ancient core pathways play a crucial role in optimizing the function of later-evolved mutualistic arsenals in the rhizobium-legume coevolution. IMPORTANCE Significant roles of complex extracellular microbiota in environmental adaptation of eukaryotes in ever-changing circumstances have been revealed. Given the intracellular infection ability, facultative endosymbionts can be considered pioneers within complex extracellular microbiota and are ideal organisms for understanding the early stage of interkingdom adaptation. This work reveals that the later innovation of key symbiotic arsenals and the lineage-specific network rewiring in ancient core pathways, predating the divergence of legumes and rhizobia, underline the progressive evolution of rhizobium-legume compatibility. This insight not only is significant for improving the application benefits of rhizobial inoculants in sustainable agriculture but also advances our general understanding of the interkingdom coevolution which is theoretically explored by all host-microbiota interactions.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/mSystems.01299-20,WOS,Journal

It is also examined whetherthis cooperation is a determining factor for business innovation (innovation networks), drawing a distinction between technological and non-technological innovations. Design/methodology/approach - The study has a quantitative approach; it analyzes the case of 312 companies in a cluster of agribusinesses in an emerging economy (Chile). The proposal model and its interrelations are tested with exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling. Findings - The results show that cognitive-organizational proximity is a positive determinant of business cooperation with other organizations, whereas social and institutional proximity are negative determinants. It is also established that business cooperation is a positive determinant of business innovation. It is more relevant in the case of technological innovation unlike non-technological innovations. In addition, it is noted that business cooperation levels are lower in micro-enterprises, a result that differs from developed countries. Practical implications - For business managers, it is best to cooperate with companies that are similar in terms of cognitive and organizational levels for innovation. At the same time, it is necessary develop strategies to reduce the social and institutional barriers to cooperation, especially in the agribusiness sector. Originality/value - The contributions of the study are as follows: an in-depth quantitative examination of the relationships of various non-spatial proximities as determinants of business cooperation; an analysis of whether business cooperation with other organizations is a determining factor for business innovation, distinguishing between technological and non-technological innovation; and testing these relationships in the context of agribusiness in an emerging economy such as Chile's because most of studies are related to high-tech sector and developed economies.",2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JBIM-01-2016-0003,WOS,Journal

Our goal is to predict the Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE), an indicator of the fishing resources exploitation useful for fisheries management. Our predictive results are preliminary in both the temporal data horizon that we are able to explore and in the limited set of learning techniques that are employed on this task. We discuss several approaches that we plan to apply in the near future to learn from such data, evidence, and knowledge that will be useful for fisheries management.

The complexity of such an enterprise is creating major challenges that require a future oriented systemic approach, looking at the EU economy and society as a whole, and going beyond current agendas and policies. The purpose of the JRC foresight study 2035: Paths towards a sustainable EU economy was to explore how this could be possible. Resource efficiency was at the core of the reflection. This created a context where the fiscal framework was perceived by the experts involved as essential in driving (or hindering) the evolution towards a more sustainable future. Societal values (individualistic or collaborative) were selected as the other axis around which to construct four scenarios. A large number of other drivers of change were taken into account to construct scenarios of a sufficient depth and detail to generate a systemic understanding. The scenarios were used in an original way to help experts identify which policy mixes would be best adapted to push each scenario towards a more sustainable future, while respecting its own logic and constraints. For each scenario, 6 policy domains considered the most relevant were selected among more than 50. Research and innovation, new business models and education were considered important for all four scenarios. The other domains were natural resources management, regulation, ethics, employment, transparency, governance, social protection, and systems integration. The study illustrates how powerful a policy framework which is fiscally supportive of environmental sustainability can be in supporting resource efficiency and that this can be achieved in very different ways depending on the prevailing social values. It also shows how a combination of actions in other policy areas can be used to drive sustainability further. In sum, this work illustrates how the creative use of foresight can help design policy mixes that can open the way to very different paths towards a sustainable future.",2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su8040309,WOS,Journal

This paper explores the ways in which educators describe how open education is impacting their pedagogical designs. Using a phenomenological approach with self-identifying open education practitioners, we explore how open educational practices (OEP) are being actualised in formal higher education in the context of British Columbia (BC), Canada. The findings suggest that OEP represent an emerging form of learning design, which draws from existing models of constructivist and networked pedagogy, while using the affordances of open tools and content to create and share learning in novel ways. Faculty members report finding ways to use open approaches and technologies to support and enable active learning experiences, present and share learners' work in real-time, support formative feedback, peer review, and, ultimately, promote community-engaged coursework. By designing learning in this way, faculty members offer learners an opportunity to consider and practise developing themselves as public citizens, develop their knowledge and literacies for working appropriately with copyright and controlling access to their online contributions, while presenting options for extending some of those rights to others. Inviting learners to share their work more widely, demonstrates to them that their work has inherent value beyond the course and can be an opportunity for them to engage directly with their community.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.5334/jime.512,WOS,Journal

The purpose of this paper is to investigate current debates in the field: the first is about cumulative vs composite knowledge; the second concerns the degree of diversity and redundancy in knowledge-based dynamics; and the third debate is about incremental vs radical innovation. Design/methodology/approach - The authors have used an inductive approach to perform a longitudinal case study of multinational corporation-semiconductor (MNC-SC). Total of 13 interviews were conducted over a four-year period. The MNC-SC case study has given the opportunity to analyse knowledge resources, knowledge, and innovation processes in a context of internationalization. Findings - The findings indicate that in order to achieve technological innovation in a context of internationalization, the company builds knowledge in a cumulative fashion, which can create a path dependency problem. To ensure complementarity between cross-functional teams located long distances from one another, and maximize the utilization of resources, MNC-SC must establish common standards. To maximize returns from composite knowledge, in a context of internationalization, knowledge diversity is preferable over redundancy. However, true knowledge transfer, sharing, and learning are limited. Combinatorial and incremental innovation through internationalization is a process based on trial and error; it maximizes technological performance and enables the company to fulfil needs without diverging from the technological trajectory of the SC industry. Originality/value - The internationalization process revealed limitations: limited understanding of the content of each knowledge module, competency traps, limited innovativeness, and therefore limited wealth creation.",2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EJIM-05-2015-0031,WOS,Journal

In addition, we identify 12 shopper journey archetypes representing the paths that consumers commonly followâ€”archetypes that illustrate the workings and applications of our model. We discuss the nature of these archetypes, their relationships with one another, and the psychological states that consumers may experience on these shopper journeys. We also present exploratory empirical studies assessing the component states in the archetypes and mapping the archetypes onto dimensions of shopping motivations.

A possible way to deal with the above challenge is to adopt Circular Economy (CE) concepts to make a close loop of material by eliminating industrial or post-consumer wastes. Integration of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning, and big data analytics provides significant support in successfully adopting and implementing CE practices. This study aims to explore the applications of AI techniques in enhancing the adoption and implementation of CE practices. A systematic literature review was performed to analyze the existing scenario and the potential research directions of AI in CE. A collection of 220 articles was shortlisted from the SCOPUS database in the field of AI in CE. A text mining approach, known as Structural Topic Modeling (STM), was used to generate different thematic topics of AI applications in CE. Each generated topic was then discussed with shortlisted articles. Further, a bibliometric study was performed to analyze the research trends in the field of AI applications in CE. A research framework was proposed for AI in CE based on the review conducted, which could help industrial practitioners, and researchers working in this domain.

However, the psychological processes and underlying mechanism concerning how and why innovative behavior occurs within an organization still invite more investigation. The present study considers ambidextrous organizational culture as a pro-innovation culture and proposes that it can be perceived by employees, which leads to their innovative behavior. This study adds clarity by exploring the impact of perceived ambidextrous organizational culture on employees' reactions related to innovation via the intermediate mechanism of psychological empowerment and the moderating condition of transformational leadership. Hypotheses are derived from a motivational perspective based on self-determination theory. Results are based on data collected from 647 Chinese employee-supervisor dyads. This study finds that employees' perceptions of ambidextrous organizational culture have an indirect effect on innovative behavior through psychological empowerment. Specifically, the positive indirect relationship is amplified when transformational leadership is at a higher level. Our findings show how the mediating mechanism of psychological empowerment and the moderating condition of transformational leadership work together to improve innovation by individuals. The findings reveal several ways in which organizations can strategically focus on their cultural and supervisory training, such as applying this model to improve employees' outcome related to innovation.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02192,WOS,Journal

Although trajectory data is of great value to many applications, it is challenging to analyze and mine trajectory data due to the complex characteristics reflected in human mobility, which is affected by multiple contextual information. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Context Trajectory Embedding Model, called MC-TEM, to explore contexts in a systematic way. MC-TEM is developed in the distributed representation learning framework, and it is flexible to characterize various kinds of useful contexts for different applications. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the distributed representation learning methods apply to trajectory data. We formally incorporate multiple context information of trajectory data into the proposed model, including user-level, trajectory-level, location-level, and temporal contexts. All the context information is represented in the same embedding space. We apply MC-TEM to two challenging tasks, namely location recommendation and social link prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets.

Based on the panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2009 to 2019, this paper uses the epsilon-based measure model and entropy method to measure the total factor rate of green economy and the development level of green finance. It then brings green finance, technological innovation, industrial structure upgrading, environmental supervision and high-quality economic development into a unified research framework for the first time. By constructing a panel two-way fixed effect model, regulatory intermediary effect model and threshold effect model, this paper empirically tests the action mechanism and constraints between green finance and high-quality economic development. The results show that: (1) The spatial evolution of green finance in China presents a gradient decreasing pattern from east to middle to west, coastal to inland, and the spatial evolution presents an obvious southwest-northeast pattern. (2) Green finance does have a significant role in promoting high-quality economic development, in which technological innovation and industrial structure upgrading play a part of the intermediary role. This conclusion is still valid under the robustness test of lagged explanatory variables and after the possible endogenous problems are alleviated by the difference-in-difference model (DID). (3) Environmental regulation plays a non-linear regulatory role in the relationship between green finance and high-quality economic development, and there is a single threshold value. Too high intensity of environmental regulation will weaken green finance, resulting in the innovation compensation effect being more diminutive than the circular cost effect.

Werecently proposed that hierarchical state abstraction enabled generalization of simple one-step rules, by inferring context clusters for each rule. However, humans' daily tasks are often temporally extended, and necessitate more complex multi-step, hierarchically structured strategies. The options framework in hierarchical reinforcement learning provides a theoretical framework for representing such transferable strategies. Options are abstract multi-step policies, assembled from simpler one-step actions or other options, that can represent meaningful reusable strategies as temporal abstractions. We developed a novel sequential decision-making protocol to test if humans learn and transfer multi-step options. In a series of four experiments, we found transfer effects at multiple hierarchical levels of abstraction that could not be explained by flat reinforcement learning models or hierarchical models lacking temporal abstractions. We extended the options framework to develop a quantitative model that blends temporal and state abstractions. Our model captures the transfer effects observed in human participants. Our results provide evidence that humans create and compose hierarchical options, and use them to explore in novel contexts, consequently transferring past knowledge and speeding up learning.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/rev0000295,WOS,Journal

The present research examines the relationship between corporate green strategy and sustainable firm performance for SMEs by exploring the mediating role of corporate social responsibility and green innovation in the given context in an emerging economy. This study applies a quantitative approach by using a well-structured questionnaire for data collection. The target respondents were managers at senior and middle levels. There were 469 valid responses obtained from the main survey. The final data was included in the analysis using Smart PLS (version 3.3.2) Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) to investigate the relationships between constructs and latent variables and provides an extension to the current literature by providing an integrated model of corporate green strategy, green corporate social responsibility, green innovation and sustainable firm performance. In addition, the model's application to the emerging economy reinforces the originality of this study. This study therefore provides an integration of â€œthree greenâ€ elements in a model which is also unexplored by the extant literature. Specifically, green strategy, green corporate social responsibility and green innovation are integrated, aiming to facilitate enterprises, improve environmental performance, enhance sustainable competitive advantages and achieve firm sustainability. Moreover, this study provides strategic thinking for long-term business development towards a sustainable balance of economic, social and environmental benefits, through which business leaders are encouraged to consider practical actions carefully to improve environmental performance as this is certain to develop business competitiveness and achieve sustainable business performance.

The developed GI-ALE model is defined by introducing the principles of the group investigation (GI) model to the existing ALE instructional model based on the factors of six types of collective intelligence: shared vision and value formation, knowledge in specific areas and diversity in those areas, knowledge sharing system, dynamism through decentralization and integration, and synergy effect. After deriving the learning design principles from the attributes of the six types of collective intelligence, the specific teaching and learning elements have been extracted. The GI-ALE model consists of seven steps: announcing learning goals, organizing groups and subtopics, preparing an experimental plan, preparing preliminary reports, the presentation of pre-report written in group unit, experimenting, creating report in group unit, and sharing and evaluating the outputs. It was applied to 76 students in a chemistry experiment lesson engaged in the second-grade curriculum at a Science High School. From qualitative data obtained after model application, this model helped students to acquire advanced scientific experimental skills and various types of knowledge. It has been also confirmed that the students experienced dynamic interactions and decentralized leadership as required by collective intelligence in the process of sharing and integrating professional experimental knowledge. In addition, the students had many opportunities for individual and collective reflection through open self-directed learning. By using one device on a variety of topics with their colleagues through group activities, they had the confidence to utilize it individually. The GI-ALE instructional model also helped scientifically-gifted students to deepen their scientific inquiry level. This model will encourage the gifted students to be able to explore the real world, to learn the attributes of collective intelligence, and to produce knowledge autonomously.

What they lacked is a mechanism by which an analytical description of urban complexity could be translated into a design description. An attempt to define such a mechanism is presented in this paper, where knowledge is retrieved from the natural organization that cities settle into, and devised in a procedural model to support urban planning at the problem definition stage. The model comprises two automated modules, giving preference to street accessibility. The first module implements plausible spatial laws to generate street structures. The performance criteria of these structures are measured against accessibility scores and clustering patterns of street segments. In the second module, an Artificial Neural Networks model (ANNs) is trained on Barcelona's data, outlining how street width, building height, block density and retail land use might be dependent on street accessibility. The ANNs is tested on Manhattan's data. The application of the two computational modules is explored at the problem definition stage of urban planning in order to verify how far deterministic knowledge-based models are in the transition from analysis to design. Our findings suggest that the computational framework proposed could be instrumental at generating simplified representation of an urban grid, whilst being effective at forecasting form-related and functional attributes within a minimum resolution of 200 m. It is finally concluded that as design progresses, knowledge-based models may serve as to minimize uncertainty about complex urban planning problems.",2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-44989-0_29,WOS,Conference Paper

Based on the theory of evolutionary resilience, we developed an analytical framework for the industrial structure evolution of old industrial cities, and applied the framework to a case study in Shenyang. The following conclusions are drawn. First, since 1978, Shenyangâ€™s industrial growth capacity has shown fluctuation between â€˜contraction-expansionâ€™. As the secondary industry has a much stronger expansionary and contractionary capacity for growth, this results in lacking stability leading to industrial structure transformation. Second, since 1999, the orientation towards a high-end manufacturing industry in Shenyang has weakened, and the evolution of the new and old growth path is characterized by low-end orientation. Third, since 2007, Shenyangâ€™s industrial innovation output capacity has dropped sharply which has been significantly affected by scientific and technological personnel and enterprise-owed science and technology institutions and to a less extent by R&D expenditure. We applied the resilience theory to study the industrial evolution of an old industrial city, explored new study perspectives on industrial evolution and verified the applicability of the resilience theory.

Currently, this is mainly done by clinicians in a clinical setting, which is dependent on subjective self-reported input from patients. Existing classification apps also rely on self-reported information and lack validation. Therefore, the exploratory mBrain study investigates moving to continuous, semi-autonomous and objective follow-up and classification based on both self-reported and objective physiological and contextual data. Methods: The data collection set-up of the observational, longitudinal mBrain study involved physiological data from the Empatica E4 wearable, data-driven machine learning (ML) algorithms detecting activity, stress and sleep events from the wearables' data modalities, and a custom-made application to interact with these events and keep a diary of contextual and headache-specific data. A knowledge-based classification system for individual headache attacks was designed, focusing on migraine, cluster headache (CH) and tension-type headache (TTH) attacks, by using the classification criteria of ICHD-3. To show how headache and physiological data can be linked, a basic knowledge-based system for headache trigger detection is presented. Results: In two waves, 14 migraine and 4 CH patients participated (mean duration 22.3 days). 133 headache attacks were registered (98 by migraine, 35 by CH patients). Strictly applying ICHD-3 criteria leads to 8/98 migraine without aura and 0/35 CH classifications. Adapted versions yield 28/98 migraine without aura and 17/35 CH classifications, with 12/18 participants having mostly diagnosis classifications when episodic TTH classifications (57/98 and 32/35) are ignored. Conclusions: Strictly applying the ICHD-3 criteria on individual attacks does not yield good classification results. Adapted versions yield better results, with the mostly classified phenotype (migraine without aura vs. CH) matching the diagnosis for 12/18 patients. The absolute number of migraine without aura and CH classifications is, however, rather low. Example cases can be identified where activity and stress events explain patient-reported headache triggers. Continuous improvement of the data collection protocol, ML algorithms, and headache classification criteria (including the investigation of integrating physiological data), will further improve future headache follow-up, classification and trigger detection.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12911-022-01813-w,WOS,Journal

Under this context, geographical sciences urgently needs to seek new paths through the deep integration of disciplines to better improve the knowledge system and contribute to the country and society development effectively. Based on the perspective of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), this paper firstly deeply analyzes the current status and problems of the integration and development of geographical sciences in China, and points out that it is not fully integrated with the frontier of international geographical sciences, and the global political, economic and cultural influence of geographical research in China needs to be strengthened; considers that the ability of Geographic Sciences integrating national major practical needs for theoretical and technological innovation should be improved; suggests that the internal discipline system of geographical sciences in China should be further optimized according to the needs of knowledge integration. Then, this paper proposes three paths for the integrated development of geographical sciences under the guidance of funding policies, that is, the interdisciplinary integration facing the frontiers of science and technology in the world, the multiple fields integration facing the major national development strategies, and inner-discipline integration facing the optimized application codes of NSFC. In future, based on maintaining the continuity and stability of the development of disciplines, the NSFC will encourage the integration of geographical sciences with other disciplines and fields through the improvement and innovation, so as to promote and build a healthier and more innovative system.

The findings illustrate how synergies between local leadership, empowered communities of practice and trusted intermediation stand out as key drivers for learning transformative governance, in particular if linked to open experimentation, while also shaping the role of international exchange in this. In turn, national policy tends to constrain transformative capacity development and favor incremental modifications. Across all cities studied, major gaps still remain in terms of developing social learning processes that involve systems thinking, sustainability foresight, as well as suitable approaches for embedding more radical innovations.

To this end, we introduce TransforMesh, a spatio-temporal network based on transformers that models longitudinal shape changes on 3D anatomical meshes. While transformer and mesh networks have recently shown impressive performances in natural language processing and computer vision, their application to medical image analysis has been very limited. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that combines transformer and mesh networks. Our results show that TransforMesh can model shape trajectories better than other baseline architectures that do not capture temporal dependencies.

By introducing the absorptive capacity theory and the view of organizational inertia, we have conducted empirical research on 392 Chinese environmentally friendly companies that have passed China's national high-tech enterprise certification. We verified the relevant hypotheses in our framework in a structural model analysis using Mplus. To further look at the interaction terms of potential and realized absorptive capacity, we used PROCESS in SPSS to evaluate the conditional effects of absorptive capacity on coefficient paths between entrepreneurial orientation and the two types of innovation. The results show that entrepreneurial orientation improves the absorptive capacity of organizations, thereby promoting their sustainable innovation. Furthermore, based on the theory of sustainable innovation, we proved the positive impact of realized and potential absorptive capacity on the exploitation and exploration of sustainable innovation. Organizations could balance exploitation and exploration to implement sustainable innovation by adjusting their potential and realized absorptive capacities.

In that regard, this bookâ€™s arrival is timely. Not only is the Internet of Things for energy applications, herein called the energy Internet of Things (eIoT), rapidly developing but also the transition towards sustainable energy to abate global climate is very much at the forefront of public discourse. It is within the context of these two dynamic thrusts, digitization and global climate change, that the energy industry sees itself undergoing significant change in how it is operated and managed. This book recognizes that they impose five fundamental energy management change drivers: 1.) the growing demand for electricity, 2.) the emergence of renewable energy resources, 3.) the emergence of electrified transportation, 4.) the deregulation of electric power markets, 5.) and innovations in smart grid technology. Together, they challenge many of the assumptions upon which the electric grid was first built. The goal of this book is to provide a single integrated picture of how eIoT can come to transform our energy infrastructure. This book links the energy management change drivers mentioned above to the need for a technical energy management solution. It, then, describes how eIoT meets many of the criteria required for such a technical solution. In that regard, the book stresses the ability of eIoT to add sensing, decision-making, and actuation capabilities to millions or perhaps even billions of interacting â€œsmartâ€ devices. With such a large scale transformation composed of so many independent actions, the book also organizes the discussion into a single multi-layer energy management control loop structure. Consequently, much attention is given to not just network-enabled physical devices but also communication networks, distributed control & decision making, and finally technical architectures and standards. Having gone into the detail of these many simultaneously developing technologies, the book returns to how these technologies when integrated form new applications for transactive energy. In that regard, it highlights several eIoT-enabled energy management use cases that fundamentally change the relationship between end users, utilities, and grid operators. Consequently, the book discusses some of the emerging applications for utilities, industry, commerce, and residences. The book concludes that these eIoT applications will transform todayâ€™s grid into one that is much more responsive, dynamic, adaptive and flexible. It also concludes that this transformation will bring about new challenges and opportunities for the cyber-physical-economic performance of the grid and the business models of its increasingly growing number of participants and stakeholders.

Finally, we explore the mediating role that BMI plays in the relationship between firm-level strategic agility and firm performance. Our analysis of data from 432 German firms in the electronics industry indicates that strategic agility is positively related to BMI and that this relationship is indeed strengthened by the degree of environmental turbulence. Additionally, our findings show that, while value proposition and value creation BMIs have positive relationships with firm performance, value capture innovation is negatively related to firm performance; these findings are contrary to our prediction. Finally, the results of our mediation tests indicate that BMI serves as an important intermediary mechanism through which firms' strategic agility contributes to superior firm performance.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TEM.2019.2910381,WOS,Journal

This study draws on the theoretical base of trade show literature and the new service development (NSD) process for trade show innovation to propose an inductive and exploratory approach to researching this process in the exhibition industry. Based on qualitative elite interviews conducted from an organizer's perspective in two countries, Germany and Poland, it aims to profile the stages of NSD for new trade show innovations through analysis of the decision-making methodology and evaluation criteria used in this process. Structured interview data collected from 34 trade show organizers, offers empirical evidence for the strong relevance of trade show innovations in both developed and emerging exhibition markets. The study reveals that demand-related considerations are primary decision factors in the idea screening phase. Diverse partnership models are used for concept development, space-related revenue components are dominant in the business analysis phase, though value-added service revenues are close in terms of relevance. Two main clusters of organizers differ in terms of the methodology they use for evaluation, though both cite thorough analysis as vital in order to enable sustained innovation activity. The theoretical and managerial implications of the study findings suggest key methodology to apply and decision criteria to evaluate before authorizing a trade show innovation project. The study contributes a starting point to better understand the organizers motives and business perspective of trade shows and the process to initiate trade show innovation for new and growing exhibition centers and business destinations.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhtm.2019.10.005,WOS,Journal

An empirical study,JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL COMPUTING AND ELECTRONIC COMMERCE,,10.1080/10919392.2018.1407081,"Nowadays, enterprise social media practitioners and researchers are keen to know how the enterprise usage of social media can be converted into the improved organizational performance. Meanwhile, organizational learning has long been considered as one of the measures of organizational performance. This article investigated the impact of enterprise social networking systems (ESNS) usage on knowledge management processes and organizational learning; in particular, we examined the mediating role of knowledge creation and knowledge sharing. Four theories from sociology and strategic management were used to build the hypotheses in the research model. An online survey was conducted to empirically test the model. Our study results showed that ESNS usage directly and indirectly influences organizational learning; and that knowledge management processes (knowledge creation and sharing) mediate the path between the two. This study contributes to the existing literature on enterprise social media for three reasons. First, it is among the first to connect the three independent concepts (social media, knowledge management, and organizational learning) and explore their relationships in one theoretical framework. Second, this work also specifically examines the influence of ESNS (Yammer in this case) on organizational processes and outcomes. Third, this is a pioneering study that employs multiple theories to address the research questions under the organizational social media context. Therefore, the research gives implications for both practitioners and scholars who are interested in understanding the effectiveness of ESNS usage in the modern organizations today.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10919392.2018.1407081,WOS,Journal

Analysis on functional brain networks provides powerful abilities to discover potential mechanisms of human brain, and to aid brain disease detection, such as AD (Alzheimerâ€™s disease). Effective discrimination of patients of AD and MCI (mild cognitive impairment) from NC (normal control) is important for the early diagnosis of AD. Therefore, this paper explores the problem of brain network classification for AD detection. Two deep learning methods of functional brain network classification are designed. The convolutional learning method learns the deep regional-connectivity features, while the recurrent learning method learns the deep adjacent positional features. The ELM (extreme learning machine)-boosted structure is also implemented to further improve the learning ability. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate and compare the AUC (area under curve), accuracy, recall, and training time of the proposed methods on a real-world dataset. Results indicate that (1) the proposed methods which learn deep features directly from brain networks outperform shallow learning methods and (2) models with the ELM-boosted structure achieve a higher performance. This paper explores the brain networks learning with deep features and ELM. The results demonstrate that the proposed methods provide a satisfactory learning ability in the application of AD detection.

As such, IT governance (ITG) is paramount in accompanying IT to allow innovation. However, the traditional concept of ITG to control the formulation and implementation of IT strategy is not fully equipped to deal with the current changes occurring in the digital age. Today's ITG needs an agile approach that can respond to changing dynamics. Consequently, companies are relying heavily on agile strategies to secure better company performance. This paper aims to clarify how organizations can implement agile ITG. To do so, this study conducted 56 qualitative interviews with professionals from the banking industry to identify agile dimensions within the governance construct. The qualitative evaluation uncovered 46 agile governance dimensions. Moreover, these dimensions were rated by 29 experts to identify the most effective ones. This led to the identification of six structure elements, eight processes, and eight relational mechanisms. Â© 2019 IEEE Computer Society.

Design/methodology/approach: The samples of 498 households were selected from a stratified cluster from the Chittagong city and were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. The data have been analysed using exploratory factor analysis and structural equation modelling. Findings: The results show that consumers' subjective knowledge (SK) is significant for purchase intention whereas objective knowledge (OK) is not. Again, consumers' SK, OK, knowledge discrepancy and confusion have no influence in forming consumers' attitude towards FF. However, consumers who overestimate their actual level of knowledge hold negative attitude towards FF and vice versa. Furthermore, consumers' OK affects their confusion inversely although it does not influence the purchase intention significantly. Practical implications: If the marketers can frame a more engaging means of communication and knowledge enhancement plan, consumers' attitude and purchase intention regarding FF will be signified. Originality/value: This is the first study that fundamentally contributes to the scientific research in that it measures the knowledge discrepancy of consumers regarding FF. In addition, this study substantiates that low objective knowledge leads to confusing consumers at the time of purchasing. The effect of overestimating the level of knowledge as well as underestimating the level of knowledge in explaining the purchase intention of FF would be a supplementary addition.

(2021),Investigating Transfer Learning for Characterization and Performance Prediction in Unconventional Reservoirs,"SPE Middle East Oil and Gas Show and Conference, MEOS, Proceedings",,10.2118/204563-MS,"Transfer learning is a machine learning concept whereby the knowledge gained (e.g., a model developed) in one task can be transferred (applied) to solve a different but related task. In the context of unconventional reservoirs, the concept can be used to transfer a machine learning model that is learned from data in one field (or shale play) to another, thereby significantly reducing the data needs and efforts to build a new model from scratch. In this work, we study the feasibility of developing deep learning models that can capture and transfer common features in a rich dataset pertaining to a mature unconventional play to enable production prediction in a new unconventional play with limited available data. The focus in this work is on method development using simulated data that correspond to the Bakken and Eagle Ford Shale Plays as two different unconventional plays in the US. We use formation and completion parameter ranges that correspond to the Bakken play with their simulated production responses to explore different approaches for training neural network models that enable transfer learning to predict production responses of input parameters corresponding to the Eagle Ford play (previously unseen input parameters). We explore different schemes by accessing the internal components of the model to extrapolate and categorize salient features that are represented in the trained neural network. Ultimately, our goal is to use these new mechanisms to enable effective sharing and reuse of discovered features from one unconventional well to another. To extract salient trends from formation and completion input parameters and their corresponding simulated production responses, we use deep learning architectures that consist of convolutional encoder-decoder networks. The architecture is then trained with rich simulated data from one field to generate a robust mapping between the input and the output feature spaces. The ""learned"" parameters from this network can then be ""transferred"" to develop a different predictive model for another field that may lack sufficient historical data. The results show that using standard training approaches, a neural network model that is trained with sufficiently large data samples from Bakken could produce reliable prediction models for typical wells that may be found in that field. The same neural network, however, could not produce reliable predictions for a typical Eagle Ford well. Furthermore, we observe that a neural network trained with insufficient data samples from Eagle Ford produces a poor prediction model for typical wells that may be found in Eagle Ford. However, when extrapolated feature components of the Bakken neural network were integrated into the training process of the Eagle Ford neural network, the resulting predictions for typical Eagle Ford wells improved significantly. Moreover, we observe that the ability to transfer learning can improve when specialized training strategies are adopted to enable transfer learning. Using several numerical experiments, the paper presents and assesses various transfer learning strategies to predict the production performance of unconventional wells in a new area with limited information by integrating knowledge from more mature plays.

In this context, researchers are presently using advanced molecular techniques, modern sequencing technologies, and metagenomics, to explore the structural and functional aspects of genes that analyze the protein composition. Metagenomics has a huge prospective to endow with fundamental knowledge on plant-microbe interactions necessary for new innovations to increase sustainable agricultural productivity.

The results show that even though the app took into account the full range of SME dynamic capabilities and proved valuable, SMEs remained dependent on the affordances of the existing global digital platforms. The findings point to the lock-in effect of â€˜freelyâ€™ available digital platforms and that SMEs tend to default to their path dependency (and therefore the existing global digital platforms) rather than explore local digital innovations. The paper suggests that intentional efforts from powerful actors such as government might be necessary to overcome the path dependency and lock-in effect of â€˜freelyâ€™ available global digital platforms.

Based on a thorough analysis of multisource and multi-country data, the authors define product frugality as a set of product characteristics that particularly appeals to consumers who, by necessity or choice, value products with a low cost of consumption that, at the same time, are sustainable, simple, and offer basic quality. Applying established procedures of index construction to a large and diverse set of consumer data from the U.S., the U.K., Germany, India, and South Africa (n = 2398), the authors develop and validate an index of product frugality. The results depict product frugality as a formative construct with four dimensions: cost of consumption, sustainability, simplicity, and basic quality. The findings point out that low cost and environmental sustainability have to be combined rather than weighed against each other to create truly frugal products. The present study generates a common understanding of product frugality that acknowledges the multi-dimensional nature of this construct. Homological examination of the developed index reveals that product frugality increases consumers' willingness to generate word of mouth. This research proffers guidance for managers seeking to explore the potential of frugal products in addressing consumers' need for higher value products while minimizing environmental impact.

In the last decade, the booming exposure of humans to robots has fostered an increasing interest in soft robotics. By empowering robots with new physical properties, autonomous actuation, and sensing mechanisms, soft robots are making increasing impacts on areas such as health and medicine. At the same time, the public sympathy to robots is increasing. However, there is still a great need for innovation to push robotics toward more diverse applications. To overcome the major limitation of soft robots, which lies in their softness, strategies are being explored to combine the capabilities of soft robots with the performance of hard metallic ones by using composite materials in their structures. After reviewing the major specificities of hard and soft robots, paths to improve actuation speed, stress generation, self-sensing, and actuation will be proposed. Innovations in controlling systems, modeling, and simulation that will be required to use composite materials in robotics will be discussed.

In recent years, the extensive application of convolutional neural network has made it become a new direction for the computer architecture research that is developing rapidly. Currently, there is a growing demand on off-line deploying deep learning network on top of embedded mobile systems. However, how to balance the limited computing and storage resources on embedded platforms, and the huge storage requirements with the increase of network complexity, has become the core problem of current research. In this paper, we explore the optimization technology to enable high-performance deep learning network for embedded systems from two aspects: the neural network design and the acceleration on embedded platforms. We focus on convolutional neural networks. First, we combine several technologies and propose a set of pruning mechanisms to save storage resources. We also explore the concept of block-wise sparsity. Second, from the perspective of mobile deployment, we propose a method to automatically select the optimal convolution/matrix multiplication approach based on the sparsity of the matrix and its sparse structure. Our experiments on NVIDIA TX1 show that our approach can be used together to promote each other and achieve the goal of improving the performance of computation while reducing the storage consumption.

Technological advancements such as next-generation mobile communications are reshaping the business ecosystem of Industry 4.0, resulting in emerging business opportunities for new players, such as local operators, to collaborate and compete with mobile communications companies that are implementing I4.0. These changes raise the need to explore emerging business opportunities concerning the digitalization of future factories. New data and connectivity services are introduced to serve the needs of rapidly increasing machine-type communications that rely on connectivity, primarily through the fifth generation (5G) mobile solutions provided by local operators. Thus, this paper outlines the potential value configurations for data and connectivity solutions by identifying, matching, and bridging the utilizable resources and addressable needs within the factory processes. The research applies an exploratory approach and uses the Gioia method to analyze qualitative data of a single case. The study follows the connectivity-content-context-commerce typology (4C) of Internet business models to structure, analyze, and classify the identified needs and resources in future factories from the perspective of the local operator. The findings show that the content layer of 4C business model typology is the most dominant among data and connectivity-based needs and resources of future factories. The paper contributes by presenting four alternative value configurations for digitalization for local operators in the future factory context: the product, component, platform, and complementary businesses. The results suggest content- and context-specific businesses carries foremost business potential for local operators, however quantitative validation will bring fruitful research avenues.

Inspired by its successes and promises, several AI ecosystems are blossoming, many of them within the domain of materials science and engineering. These materials intelligence ecosystems are being shaped by several independent developments. Machine learning (ML) algorithms and extant materials data are utilized to create surrogate models of materials properties and performance predictions. Materials data repositories, which fuel such surrogate model development, are mushrooming. Automated data and knowledge capture from the literature (to populate data repositories) using natural language processing approaches is being explored. The design of materials that meet target property requirements and of synthesis steps to create target materials appear to be within reach, either by closed-loop active-learning strategies or by inverting the prediction pipeline using advanced generative algorithms. AI and ML concepts are also transforming the computational and physical laboratory infrastructural landscapes used to create materials data in the first place. Surrogate models that can outstrip physics-based simulations (on which they are trained) by several orders of magnitude in speed while preserving accuracy are being actively developed. Automation, autonomy and guided high-throughput techniques are imparting enormous efficiencies and eliminating redundancies in materials synthesis and characterization. The integration of the various parts of the burgeoning ML landscape may lead to materials-savvy digital assistants and to a human-machine partnership that could enable dramatic efficiencies, accelerated discoveries and increased productivity. Here, we review these emergent materials intelligence ecosystems and discuss the imminent challenges and opportunities. The materials research landscape is being transformed by the infusion of approaches based on machine learning.

(2022),Intelligent Scheduling Method for Bulk Cargo Terminal Loading Process Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning,ELECTRONICS,,10.3390/electronics11091390,"Sea freight is one of the most important ways for the transportation and distribution of coal and other bulk cargo. This paper proposes a method for optimizing the scheduling efficiency of the bulk cargo loading process based on deep reinforcement learning. The process includes a large number of states and possible choices that need to be taken into account, which are currently performed by skillful scheduling engineers on site. In terms of modeling, we extracted important information based on actual working data of the terminal to form the state space of the model. The yard information and the demand information of the ship are also considered. The scheduling output of each convey path from the yard to the cabin is the action of the agent. To avoid conflicts of occupying one machine at same time, certain restrictions are placed on whether the action can be executed. Based on Double DQN, an improved deep reinforcement learning method is proposed with a fully connected network structure and selected action sets according to the value of the network and the occupancy status of environment. To make the network converge more quickly, an improved new epsilon-greedy exploration strategy is also proposed, which uses different exploration rates for completely random selection and feasible random selection of actions. After training, an improved scheduling result is obtained when the tasks arrive randomly and the yard state is random. An important contribution of this paper is to integrate the useful features of the working time of the bulk cargo terminal into a state set, divide the scheduling process into discrete actions, and then reduce the scheduling problem into simple inputs and outputs. Another major contribution of this article is the design of a reinforcement learning algorithm for the bulk cargo terminal scheduling problem, and the training efficiency of the proposed algorithm is improved, which provides a practical example for solving bulk cargo terminal scheduling problems using reinforcement learning.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics11091390,WOS,Journal

Leadership, the formal and informal governance within an organization, drives an infrastructure system's ability to respond to changing circumstances. Due to the instability of the Anthropocene, infrastructure managers (individuals who design, build, maintain, and decommission infrastructure) can no longer rely on assumptions of stationarity, but instead that shifts are occurring at a faster rate than institutions and infrastructure organizations are adapting. Leadership and organizational change literature provide considerable insights into the ability of organizations to navigate uncertainty and complexity, and infrastructure organizations may be able to learn from this knowledge to avoid obsolescence. Therefore, this article asks: what leadership capabilities do infrastructure organizations need to readily respond to stability and instability? An integrative leadership framework is proposed, exploring capabilities of collaboration, perception and exploration toward learning, and flexible informal and formal governance leveraged by leadership. These capabilities are driven by underlying tensions (e.g., climate change, emerging technologies) and managed through enabling leadership, a set of processes for pivoting between stability and instability. The framework is then applied to infrastructure organizations. Lack of market competition may make infrastructure organizations more open to collaboration and, therefore, learning. However, the need to provide specific services may cause risk adversity and an avoidance of failure, restricting flexibility and innovation. It is critical for infrastructure organizations to identify their strengths and weaknesses so they may develop an approach to change at pace with their external environments.

As in many areas of organizational life, errors in measuring innovation are a recurring fact. Innovation researchers and practitioners alike have become increasingly interested in understanding the occurrence of organizational errors and how these errors affect innovation and its measurement. This empirical study aims to address this under-explored area by utilizing a qualitative in-depth case study at the innovation department of an organization with production sites and sales organizations worldwide. A total of 28 semi-structured interviews at several organizational levels were conducted, with innovation managers, project managers, senior managers, and staff. Based on the findings in this case study, three explanations are presented on how organizational errors occur when using innovation KPIs (key performance indicators). The first explanation can be connected to the increasing complexity of innovation and its intangible nature. Another explanation can be traced to the difference between innovation strategy and innovation KPIs. Lastly, room for organizational errors can be related to the multitude of individuals and organizational levels involved in innovation and its measurement. The implications for practitioners are that innovation KPIs are not precise metrics but should be seen as estimates with organizational errors. Whether or not these innovation KPIs can be used as tools to turn innovation into competitive advantages largely depends on whether wrong is right. Future research should focus on the metrics that are implemented and actually in use, as this future path would highlight the function and dysfunction that organizational errors in innovation KPIs can have.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jrfm14070332,WOS,Journal

A multiplicity of climate hazards will be involved, triggering cumulative and interactive impacts on a variety of natural and human systems. An improved understanding of risk interactions and dynamics is required to support decision makers in their ability to better manage current and future climate change risks. To face this issue, the research community has been starting to test new methodological approaches and tools, including the application of Machine Learning (ML) leveraging the potential of the large availability and variety of spatio-temporal big data for environmental applications. Given the increasing attention on the application of ML methods to Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA), this review mapped out the state of art and potential of these methods to this field of research. Scientometric and systematic analysis were jointly applied providing an in-depth review of publications across the 2000-2020 timeframe. The resulting output from the analysis showed that a huge variety of ML algorithms have been already applied within CCRA, among them, the most recurrent are Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Network. These algorithms are often applied in an ensemble or hybridized way to analyze most of all floods and landslides risk events. Moreover, the application of ML to deal with remote sensing data is consistent and effective across reviewed CCRA applications, allowing the identification and classification of targets and the detection of environmental and structural features. On the contrary concerning future climate change scenarios, literature seems not to be very widespread into scientific production, compared to studies evaluating risks under current conditions. The same lack can be noted also for the assessment of cascading and compound hazards and risks, since these concepts are recently emerging in CCRA literature but not yet in combination with ML-based applications.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2021.103752,WOS,Journal

Through a longitudinal, exploratory qualitative case study of a large firm, this article investigates how organizational members respond to an ambidextrous organizing model designed to accelerate digital innovations. The firm relied on a hybrid model of separation and integration to organize and manage its digital transformation efforts. This study unfolds the implications and consequences of such a model at the micro-level. By applying a paradox lens, it shows how the coping actions of organizational members affected the digital transformation. The article illustrates how the hybrid organizing model led to the emergence of three paradoxes at the organizational level (paradoxes of organizing, attention, and knowledge sharing) that organizational members had to cope with. It shows how organizational members, through their coping with these paradoxes, indirectly affected the organizing model by altering its original design; and how the management, influenced by these learnings, subsequently adapted the model to enable a better sustainability over time. Overall, the findings show and explain why organizing for digital transformation is a particularly complex and paradoxical endeavor. They also provide important insights to managers and organizational developers, helping them to become aware of possible tensions in their organizing efforts as well as of coping strategies and practices to tackle these tensions.

Technological innovation has been repeatedly used as a means differentiation in order to achieve a higher enterprise competitiveness. This has led to achievement of great scientific and technical progress. Nevertheless, in the last few decades, this has not prevented some territories from social issues such as poverty, exclusion, inequality, deterioration of environmental conditions and unemployment, among others. All these problems have a high local impact, being here where social innovation importance as a force for potential change is growing. Despite the broad consensus regarding the potential and the positive effects that social innovation has in those territories, there is still considerable debate surrounding how this concept should be defined and what factors contribute to its appearance. There are many variables that have been mentioned in the literature; however, a review of previous works shows that it is an open field for the identification of new ones. As described above, this paper has three main aims: to analyze the state of the art up to now, to give a definition of social innovation and to identify, analyze and weigh those key factors for its emergence in the territories. To this end we have designed a methodology based on a series of qualitative analysis techniques. Firstly, a review of the state of the art has been carried out to obtain a first approximation to the concept of social innovation and determine which elements are decisive in its appearance. Secondly, based on the existing literature and knowing what the problem is, we complete the methodology by designing and conducting semi-structured interviews. We chose this technique because we understand that social innovation is a living and constantly evolving phenomenon. This makes it very useful and allows us to confront the ideas and evidence from our literature review in a pragmatic way. The information gathered from the interviews allow us to identify, in a reliable and empirical way, new key elements to define social innovation. Additionally, the interviews help us to recognize and weigh the existence of new essential factors for the development of social innovation. These interviews have been conducted with a total of 24 agents involved in social innovation processes: managers and directors of centers responsible for promoting social innovation; agents that developed socially innovative initiatives; and scientists and academics who published work in this field. To analyze the content of the 24 interviews, we used the Atlas. ti computer program. This tool helped us analyze the transcripts. In order to explore and interpret the texts we analyzed 24 primary archives, which represent one transcript for each interview carried out. Afterwards, we encoded them. This process is a form of data reduction, since, based on a large volume of information, we managed to segment certain pieces of information (quotes) and label them based on codes. These are the main elements of analysis and they are considered as a system of categories. In our case, each time we have identified a quote, which made reference to the existence of a factor that conditioned the irruption of social innovation or that enunciated characteristics that defined it, we labeled a code-referred to a certain factor related to the content of the quotes-. Once the individual coding and data editing was completed, we organized the codes into families. Specifically, in line with the main purposes of our analysis, in two families: one to collect the codes related to the definition of social innovation and a second to gather those related to its determinant factors. To provide our study with greater depth, it was essential to carry out a statistical analysis of the content that would allow us to know the frequency of appearance of the codes. First, we calculated the absolute frequency of the codes, referred to the number of times a quote was identified with the same code. Nevertheless, to obtain more information about the importance of each one of the codes, we relativized them considering that they had previously been divided into families. Thus, we have obtained the relative frequency by families, which is, the number of times any code is repeated within a family according to the total number of times codes included in that family appear. This contributes directly to know which factors have more strength in the emergence of social innovation, among the ones pointed out by the interviewers. After the performance of the aforementioned analysis, we suggest the following definition of social innovation: Practices or initiatives carried out by the community that, based on the products, services or models they generate, or through the process designed to achieve their objectives, they reach solutions that give a better response, in an alternative and creative way, to social problems or needs. In addition, we point out five key points for the development of social innovation: social and cultural elements; political and institutional support; knowledge and facilitating mechanisms; spatial components and entities; and mechanisms that determine the corporate and social productive structure. These gather 29 factors identified and weighted according to the number of times they were indicated by the interviewees. Therefore, this work, not only points out the key factors of social innovation and the foundations on which they are grouped by theme, but also shows the importance of each underlying determinant according to its absolute and relative frequencies. These frequencies are used as a proxy to weigh the importance of these factors and foundations. This allows to know which ones are more needed and have more weight in the emergence of social innovations. The ten factors with more impact are: the socioeconomic level of the population (0.09532), the existence of strategies and lines of action to develop social innovation (0.08838), the existence of laboratories or centers of social innovation (0.05892), the existence of public funding (0.05892), the existence of social concern (0.05719), the cultural propensity to change (0.05719), knowledge of the local reality (0.05545), knowledge of the opportunities and potential of new means and instruments (0.04506), links encouraging public-private relations (0.04332) and the existence of cooperatives (0.03986). In summary, it should be noted that the recognition of these factors, together with the weighing of their relative importance, represents a considerable innovation with respect to the existing texts. This work has allowed us to verify the suitability of some determining factors that had previously been pointed out in other studies, state new ones that emerged after the investigation, explain the correlation between them and present how important and what role each of them plays to have a beneficial ecosystem for social innovation. This knowledge can be very useful when establishing lines and criteria for the design of prioritization strategies, useful where there are restrictions of a political, organizational or budgetary nature.

To explore the impact of industrial convergence on the energy efficiency of manufacturing, we first incorporated industrial convergence and energy efficiency into a conventional macro-growth model and output density model, and analyzed the relationship between them at the theoretical level. Then, taking the convergence of the information industry and manufacturing in China as the research object, the impact and transmission mechanism of industrial convergence on energy efficiency were empirically investigated. Furthermore, three new techno-economic relevance matrices were constructed to study the spillover effect of industrial convergence using a spatial autoregressive combined model. The results showed that: (1) Industrial convergence improved the energy efficiency of manufacturing, which remained robust after overcoming endogeneity. Moreover, there was a scale effect whereby the deeper the convergence, the greater the marginal effect. (2) There was a spillover effect with regard to industrial relevance. Through cross-industry imitation and learning, industrial convergence improved the energy efficiency of the entire manufacturing sector. (3) Technological innovation was an effective mediating channel for industrial convergence to function. Industrial convergence not only had a direct impact on technological innovation, but also had an indirect impact through industrial scale expansion and factor structure optimization, thereby improving energy efficiency.

Rough terrain, obstacles, dust storms, and environmental conditions make it challenging for land rovers or drones to explore the surface and cover large amounts of terrain. In this research, a new concept of robot design is proposed for a wind-driven aerial flight based on the physical structure of the Dandelion flower. A spherical robot is designed to house 1000 dandelion-seed shaped micro robots to be driven by the common Martian winds, equipped with various sensors needed for climate monitoring, exploration, analysis, scientific experimentation, and localization on Mars. This technology harnesses a hybrid power system using local Martian winds for long-range and long-duration missions, expanding the region covered by land rovers. The dandelion micro-robot concept will incorporate RF and/or optical technologies, machine learning, and artificial intelligence-based algorithms. The combination of these methods will allow the robots to have a pre-defined objective path based on the most recently measured wind patterns and their current understanding of the surrounding environment.

Multi-sensor data fusion plays a vital role in providing these autonomous systems with sensory information of different types, from different locations, and at different times. The InFuse project, funded by the European Commission's Horizon 2020 Strategic Research Cluster in Space Robotics, provides the space community with an open-source Common Data Fusion Framework (CDFF) by which data may be fused in a modular fashion from multiple sensors. In this paper, we summarize the modular structure of this CDFF and show how it is used for the processing of sensor data to obtain data products for both planetary and orbital space robotic applications. Multiple sensor data from field testing that includes inertial measurements, stereo vision, and scanning laser range information is first used to produce robust multi-layered environmental maps for path planning. This information is registered and fused within the CDFF to produce comprehensive three-dimensional maps of the environment. To further explore the potential of the CDFF, we illustrate several applications of the CDFF that have been evaluated for orbital and planetary use cases of environmental reconstruction, mapping, navigation, and visual tracking. Algorithms for learning of maps, outlier detection, localization, and identification of objects are available within the CDFF and some early results from their use in space analogue scenarios are presented. These applications show how the CDFF can be used to provide a wide variety of data products for use by awareness and machine learning processes in space robots.

Examples include sleep trackers, fitness trackers, continuous glucose monitors, and RFID-enabled implants, with many additional biometric or health surveillance applications in development or envisioned. These data are included in growing stockpiles of personal health data (PHI) being mined for insight by health economists, policy analysts, researchers, and health system organizations. Dominant narratives position these highly personal data as valuable resources to transform healthcare, stimulate innovation in medical research, and engage individuals in their health and healthcare. Large tech companies are also increasingly implicated in these areas, through mobile health application sales and data acquisitions. Given the many possible uses and users for PGHD, ensuring privacy, security, and equity of benefits from PGHD will be challenging. This is due in part to disparate regulatory policies and practices across technology firms, health system organizations, and health researchers. Rapid developments with PGHD technologies and the lack of harmonization between regulatory regimes may render existing safeguards to preserve patient privacy and control over their PGHD ineffective, while also failing to guide PGHD-related innovation in socially desirable directions. Using a policy regime lens to explore these challenges, we examine three existing data protection regimes relevant to PGHD in the United States that are currently in tension with one another: federal and state health-sector laws, regulations on data use and reuse for research and innovation, and industry self-regulation of consumer privacy by large tech companies. We argue that harmonization of these regimes is necessary to meet the challenges of PGHD data governance. We next examine emerging governing instruments, identifying three types of structures (organizational, regulatory, technological/algorithmic), which synergistically could help enact needed regulatory oversight while limiting the friction and economic costs of regulation that may hinder innovation. This policy analysis provides a starting point for further discussions and negotiations among stakeholders and regulators to do so.

Drawing on the social network theory (SNT) and resource-based view (RBV), with mix methods approach, this paper argues that as the primary path for startups acquiring external resources, social networks are beneficial to improving innovative startups' innovation performance. Using a large amount of data from GEM (Global Entrepreneurship Monitor), this paper first runs correlation analysis and regression analysis to empirically analyze entrepreneurs' social networks' impact on China's innovative startups' innovation performance. The results show that both formal and informal social networks are positively correlated with innovative startups' innovation performance. Then we consider the moderating effect of entrepreneurial competence and motivation. And the results show both entrepreneurial competence and motivation positively moderate the correlation above. Second, to explore the above correlation's internal mechanism, we conduct semi-structured interviews with 14 entrepreneurs.

However, teachers are generally weak at knowledge-sharing and are often professionally isolated from colleagues. Regardless of the general and context-specific reasons for this weakness, researchers believe that principals' knowledge-sharing leadership (KSL) can influence teachers' knowledge-sharing behaviours (KSB). Nevertheless, little is known about how it can exert its impact. In addition, given the precedence of teachers' beliefs and intentions over their behaviours, the mechanism of this impact has not yet been investigated based on this sequence. This study seeks to investigate and compare this impact in the form of two competing models, including the theory of reasoned action and planned behaviour. Both models consider KSB due to teachers' beliefs and intentions. Design/methodology/approach In total, 445 teachers completed an online form comprising two scales, including KSL and the knowledge-sharing belief-intention-behaviour. Data were analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM). Findings The model hypothesising the impact of KSL on constructs of the theory of reasoned action had a better fit with the data. The direct and indirect relationships analysis showed that KSL directly affects two fundamental beliefs of teachers, including attitudes toward knowledge-sharing (ATKS) and subjective norms (SN). Also, these beliefs directly affected teachers' intentions and, ultimately, their KSB indirectly. Originality/value This study contributes to the school leadership literature. Further, it has supported the theory of reasoned action when the teacher's KSB is targeted. Although researchers previously have adopted this theory, they have focused more on containing constructs while neglecting principal-related external variables. Finally, this study provides insights into principals' training programs. While principals may try to be knowledge-sharing leaders through self-practising competencies, they should be purposefully trained.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JEA-09-2021-0168,WOS,Journal

Choreographers may find new possibility emerging in using virtual reality to create movement and the WhoLoDancE: Whole-Body Interaction Learning for Dance Education project is developing tools to assist in this process. The interdisciplinary team which includes dancers, choreographers, educators, artists, coders, technologists and system architects have collaborated in engaging, discussing, analysing, testing and working with end-users to help with thinking about the issues that emerge in the creation of these tools. The paper sets out to explore the creative potential of VR in the context of WhoLoDancE and how this may offer new insights for the choreographer and dancer. We pay attention to the virtual environment, the virtual performance and the virtual dancer as some of the key components for equipping the choreographer to use in the creating process and to inform the dancing body. The cyclical process of live body to virtual, back to the dancing body as a choreographic device is an innovative way to approach practice. This approach may lead to new insights and innovations in choreographic methods that may extend beyond the project and ultimately take dance performance in a new direction.

Some of the exciting application areas of CNN include Image Classification and Segmentation, Object Detection, Video Processing, Natural Language Processing, and Speech Recognition. The powerful learning ability of deep CNN is primarily due to the use of multiple feature extraction stages that can automatically learn representations from the data. The availability of a large amount of data and improvement in the hardware technology has accelerated the research in CNNs, and recently interesting deep CNN architectures have been reported. Several inspiring ideas to bring advancements in CNNs have been explored, such as the use of different activation and loss functions, parameter optimization, regularization, and architectural innovations. However, the significant improvement in the representational capacity of the deep CNN is achieved through architectural innovations. Notably, the ideas of exploiting spatial and channel information, depth and width of architecture, and multi-path information processing have gained substantial attention. Similarly, the idea of using a block of layers as a structural unit is also gaining popularity. This survey thus focuses on the intrinsic taxonomy present in the recently reported deep CNN architectures and, consequently, classifies the recent innovations in CNN architectures into seven different categories. These seven categories are based on spatial exploitation, depth, multi-path, width, feature-map exploitation, channel boosting, and attention.

As institutions implement new preclerkship curricula to better prepare medical students to practice medicine in the context of modern healthcare systems, the perspective of clerkship leaders regarding clerkship student roles and potential for change will facilitate redefining these roles so that preclerkship educational innovations can continue into clerkships. Approach: In this qualitative exploratory study, authors conducted semistructured interviews with clerkship and site directors for eight core clerkships from April to May 2016. Questions addressed how clerkship leaders perceive current student roles and the potential for change. Through iterative consensus building, authors identified themes describing current ideal clerkship student roles applicable to future roles. Findings: Twenty-three of 24 (96%) directors participated. Findings fell into four themes: factors influencing the clerkship role, clerkship student role archetypes, workplace authenticity and value, and potential for change. Student, supervisor, and context factors determine the clerkship student role. Three role archetypes emerged: the apprentice (an assistant completing concrete patient care tasks), the academic (a researcher bringing literature back to the team), and the communicator (an interdisciplinary and patient liaison). Each archetype was considered authentic and valuable. Positive attitudes toward preclerkship curricular changes were associated with openness to evolution of the clerkship students' role. These emerging roles mapped to the archetypes. Insights: Clerkship leaders perceive that student, supervisor, and context factors result in varying emphasis on role archetypes, which in turn lead to different types of learning. Medical educators can use the archetypes to articulate how expanded student roles align learning with clinical needs, particularly as they relate to health systems science and inquiry.

In a proprietary SECO, organizations are concerned with keeping their assets protected by intellectual property so that they are not exposed publicly, preventing this information from being used by competitors. Understanding how the governance mechanisms work and how organizations handle incidents on their platforms is a real challenge in this scenario. In this work, we aim at: i) providing an update on SECO governance mechanisms and SECO health metrics; ii) analyzing SECO classifications and evaluating the evolution of proprietary SECO; and iii) exploring the organization's strategies in this context and investigating the SECO incident management process. To do so, a longitudinal literature study was performed on SECO, extending an existing study that covered 2006 to 2015. As such, we analyzed 422 studies from 2016 to 2020 and provided an updated perspective based on seven research questions, as well as a refined perspective on proprietary SECO and a deep understanding on the incident management process in this scenario.

However, many foreigners are unwilling to spend time on disaster education. To improve this situation, gamification is employed. Gamification is to use game design elements or mechanisms in non-game contexts. For example, in the educational field, gamification makes learning easy and attractive, which motivates participants and encourages engagement in learning activities.

Additional Filter? How and Where?,IEEE ACCESS,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3119915,"Autonomous driving (AD) provides a reliable solution for safe driving by replacing human drivers responsible for the majority of accidents. The emergence of Machine Learning, specifically Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), and its ability to solve complex games proved its potential to address AD challenges. However, model-free methods still suffer from safety-related issues that can be resolved using safe-DRL approaches. The addition of model-based safety filters to the learning-based algorithms provides safety bounds on their performance and constraint satisfaction. In this paper, we investigate the addition of a safety filter based on Model Predictive Control and show an increase in mean testing episode reward by 110% from -75 mean episode reward during testing for 50 episodes for Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to 7.758. We study the impacts of safety filters (7.758 mean reward), heuristic rules, bounded additive noises (0.49% performance increase comparing to noise-free case), and exploration (3.425 mean reward) on the learning algorithm. We compare the effects of filters in the context of simulated exploration and bounded exploration and prove that bounded exploration results in 9.86% increase in mean reward and 12.95% decrease in std comparing to the other method. Additionally, inspired by Deep Internal Learning and biological mechanisms like brain plasticity, we investigate the idea of using each sample for training only once instead of utilizing stochastic batches which increases the mean testing accumulated reward by 1.87% and leads to the best performance (7.942 mean reward and 0.048 std). Finally, the results demonstrate better automotive results for our proposed method than DDPG. Our proposed method, DDPG with safety filter in bounded exploration and adaptive learning under noisy input conditions, has a success rate of 100% under different traffic densities for the simulation environment used in this paper and our assumptions. The proposed method's automotive results are shown for a braking scenario to avoid collision with other road users.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3119915,WOS,Journal

This paper adopts an inductive approach to explore how teams decide to engage in improvised adaptation, and what happens during those processes for improvisation to be successful. The study analyzes improvisation from the perspective of paradox theory and identifies six paradoxical tensions driven by these contexts: deployment, development, temporal, procedural, structural, and behavioral tensions. We propose a dynamic equilibrium model of team improvised adaptation that leads to team plasticity. By properly managing the paradoxical tensions emerging from the convergence of design and execution, teams become more plastic and able to cope with sudden change. These findings contribute to adaptation and improvisation literatures by delving into the adaptation process under the temporal and material confluence of design and execution.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00218863211037441,WOS,Journal

The application of Machine Learning (ML) to fishery management offers exciting new opportunities for data synthesis and analysis and integrated insights across typically siloed domains. Yet, challenges remain as ML approaches provide new means of monitoring, enforcement and data analysis. Trust is among the underlying bases of collaboration, and control is the main means of shaping collaborative decision-making techniques. As ML changes the dynamics of governance and enhances management control mechanisms, ML affects trust. ML methods are being introduced into a context that suffers a lack of transparency and trust between fishers and managers. As ML technologies continue to be used to inform fishery management and influence knowledge sharing and communication within the fishery network, forms of trust existing in the management network will be impacted differently. This article provides a concise review of a subset of potential ML applications to fishery management to explore how these emerging methods may impact forms of trust between fishery stakeholders.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/faf.12658,WOS,Journal

Prior to the pandemic, a growing number of health systems set up innovation centers to focus on creating new services and exploring new business models relevant to value-based care. This is distinct from process improvement or implementation science, and often needs a different set of incentives to succeed within a large organization. We used a national survey to identify a diverse sample of innovation centers, and interviewed leaders to describe their aims, organizational structures, and activities. They all aim to improve patient outcomes and experience while reducing costs, but their strategic focus may differ. The centers also vary in their reporting structure, how they build internal capacity, and how they measure success. We highlight the range of strategies through examples of projects that improve quality, reduce costs, and generate new revenue. While the optimal forms and impact of innovation centers are still emerging, the fiscal pressures and the rapid uptake of digital technologies present opportunities for the redesign of health services in the postpandemic era. The experiences of these centers illustrate a set of approaches to increase any organizationâ€™s capacity for innovation.

Design/methodology/approach A longitudinal case research and retrospective strategy were used to collect relevant data and information in the four university-and-firm alliance teams collaborating on R&D projects in Thailand during 2008-2014. In-depth interviews and meetings were conducted with representatives of all partners and R&D project teams. Findings The authors found that formal and informal control mechanisms act as complementary forms of governance. The informal control (trust) serves as the frame of intentions whether the formal control is interpreted as a guideline or a commitment. Both formal and informal control mechanisms must be put in place to successfully and sustainably develop collaborative research into a commercial product. Research limitations/implications This study investigated four Thai government-funded research collaboration teams from a single industry. It would be worth investigating such research collaboration in other industries and those without any government funding. Originality/value This study applied an exploratory case research method which is rarely used in research on R&D alliance teams.

We apply an experimental-learning framework to explore the influence of the capital markets on economic organization, using the conglomerate merger wave of the 1960s and 1970s as an empirical context. In our setting, the initial market popularity of conglomerates, followed by their rapid decline, is indicative of investors attempting to determine the value of a new organizational form. We provide event-study evidence that investors systematically updated their beliefs about the value of the conglomerate form based on new information (positive or negative) about the largest and most newsworthy conglomerates.

However, unresolved interdependencies remain that cannot be addressed by such arm's length mechanisms. These interdependencies reflect, for example, unidentified or emerging knowledge-based dependencies between the community members or unaccounted relationships between ongoing community tasks. At the same time, online communities cannot resort to hierarchical coordination mechanisms such as incentives or command structures to address such interdependencies. So, how do they manage such interdependencies? To address this question, we conduct an exploratory, theory-generating case study involving qualitative and computational analyses of development activities within an open source software community: Rubinius. We analyze the ongoing management of interdependencies within the community and find that unresolved interdependencies are associated with alternatively structured sequences of activities, which we define as routines. In particular, we observe that two distinct classes of interdependencies-development and developer interdependencies-are associated with alternative forms of routine variation. We identify two generalized routine components-direct implementation and knowledge integration, which address these two distinct classes of unresolved interdependencies. In particular, direct implementation deals with development interdependencies within the code that are not already coordinated through modular interfaces, while knowledge integration resolves unaccounted interdependencies between developers. We conclude with implications for research into organizing principles for online communities and note the significance of our findings for the study of coordination in organization studies in general.",2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/isre.2016.0673,WOS,Journal

This has been noted in some studies, in which researchers have made visible pedagogical models, teaching strategies and impacts of including social and solidarity economy contents and practices in undergraduate and graduate programs on the educational community, organizations and society. In accordance with the literature review, most studies have reported the perspective of professors or managers on educational experiences, but little is known about students' involvement in these processes. Consequently, it is appropriate to continue exploring the educational potential of this relationship as a contribution to the quality and relevance of higher education and, in turn, the development of social and solidarity economy as an alternative for social transformation. Objetives This article derives from an educational research process whose objective is to analyze the questions asked by university students about social and solidarity economy, giving an account of their educational interest and perspectives. Materials and Methods The study was conducted under educational research guidelines, the hermeneutic approach and descriptive-interpretative research guidance, assuming that student asks questions from their particular interest and prior knowledge. It involved 96 university students whose undergraduate curriculum includes social and solidarity economy education and who, at the time of the study, were enrolled in one of the specific courses on the subject. The technique employed to gather information was the focal group and the instrument used was a workshop called ""Question Tree"" that caused students to ask open questions on social solidarity economy. Questions were later categorized in a double-entry analysis matrix: dimensions of social and solidarity economy and types of questions according to the complexity level of the knowledge required by them. Results/Limitations/Implications Students' questions reflect their interests, expectations and cognitive processes; 170 questions were asked which, regarding the dimensions of solidarity economy, mostly reflect (49%) a pragmatic interest on the current reality of this socio-economic model, followed by an emerging category that questioned the educational strategy for the subject, especially in terms of didactics (22%). There was no particular interest in the theory. The types of questions are mainly those reflecting critical thinking and active citizenships to support social transformation (41%), followed by those looking into data (36%), which points out the need for supplementary strategies to even out basic knowledge of the topic. In some cases, there is certain skepticism about the reality and project of social and solidarity economy. Findings imply subsequent research to develop teaching strategies and the proposed topics, showing the potential of questions to trigger innovative educational processes centered on students' learning and experiences. Another alternative for future studies is to apply the same data collection instrument to a statistically representative sample of the studied population, which this qualitative research presents as a limitation to establish correlations by gender, age group, region of the country, and program. Conclusions/Originality The condensed results of the study indicate that, for university students, social and solidarity economy as a reality, theory and project becomes contents and practices that favor critical and systemic thinking, interdisciplinarity, analytical resolution of social problems, cooperative work, creativity, entrepreneurship and social innovation. Also, students demand significant learning and active participation in knowledge building based on experiences that are motivating and aimed at responding to challenges such as those posed by the problems of today's society. In this respect, the relationship between higher education and social and solidarity economy is an opportunity to introduce educational innovation that broadens students' skills to be active citizens, know about social and solidarity economy, and undertake solidarity enterprises and social innovation in the territory. In doing this and using technologies, they could join a global movement that is being consolidated by academic and union networks. This presents challenges to professors and the development of educational approaches that, based on interaction and the students' interests, knowledge and expectations, focus on learning and experience in personalized processes. Higher education in social and solidarity economy, with its potential to contribute to sustainable development, has not been sufficiently explored. While educational agendas and the social solidarity economy movement highlight the importance of young people and their role in the generational connection required to strengthen their organizations, little is known about their interests and expectations. The originality of this research then lies in the fact that it does not build on the questions asked to young students, which generally guide most studies, but on the voice of students who, with their questions and the method used, provide a baseline that can be replicated, compared with other realities, and supplemented as part of a teaching strategy applicable at different formal and non-formal educational levels that further solidarity education. Therefore, this study replicated in other higher education contexts may help to improve approaches, contents and methods to enable better coordination between education and a scenario of professional performance in the social and solidarity economy sector, taking the jobs it creates and, from entrepreneurship, establishing new organizations or providing new products and services to territories.

An accurate forecast should be based on a comprehensive understanding and description of TCs. A TC has a complex threedimensional structure, and the surrounding atmosphere is the driving force for its development. Traditional forecasting methods performed relatively well for the TCs with stable moving speed and direction. However, the forecast accuracy still leaves some space to improve. In recent years, machine learning methods that can extract features from a large amount of historical data have been used in meteorological services and have shown excellent performance. To better forecast 6, 12, 18, and 24 h TC tracks in the Western North Pacific, a hybrid optimization model, combining the 3D convolutional neural network (3DCNN), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and smoothing algorithm is designed, which is called smoothed 3D-GRU. The 3DCNN is used to explore the potential relationship between environmental variables and TC movements at different pressure levels. The GRU is used to convert the TC track forecasting problem into a spatio-temporal sequence problem. The smoothing algorithm is used as a post-processing method to suppress unreasonable jumps of the model output. The mean spherical distances (MSDs) of the proposed smoothed 3D-GRU model at four prediction times are 27.89, 52.37, 79.16, and 112.05 km, which are lower than the comparative machine learning-based forecasting algorithms. Compared with the numerical prediction methods, the MSDs of the smoothed 3D-GRU model are lower in most situations. In general, the smoothed 3D-GRU model can provide reliable guidance for the TC trajectory prediction.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2022.106053,WOS,Journal

To address this research gap, from the perspectives of specific investments, we examine the role of specific investments in relation to the outcome of green supply chain innovation. Drawing on knowledge management theory, we propose that knowledge transfer plays a mediating role underlying the relationship. On the basis of the stakeholder involvement theory, we argue that partner social responsibility plays moderating roles not only in specific investments-green supply chain innovation performance link-but also in the link of knowledge transfer and performance. We tested the proposed relationships with a sample consisted of 331 questionnaires and validated responses from 187 high-tech firms in China. The results generally support the proposed hypotheses, and the integrative model-moderated mediation-is also supported. As such, this study contributes to understand about how specific investments affect the performance of green supply chain innovation, providing new insights on stakeholder involvement and knowledge transfer in green supply chain innovation management.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bse.2410,WOS,Journal

An in-depth exploration of its sudden success reveals three distinctive features of this new business model, namely web search engine, proliferation of smart handhelds and user-generated reputation feedback mechanisms. All of these technological innovations not only inflict destructive changes to our social structure, but also lead to difficulties in an automatic inclusion of the sharing economy into the current regulatory framework. Two changes have raised particular attention. First, sharing platforms are capable of building a democratized private trust mechanism, in addition to the traditional government-monopolized public licensing system. Second, the vertical disintegration feature of the sharing economy considerably blurs the borderline between business and consumers, and between employers and employees. For the purpose of establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework for all online and offline activities, it is necessary to differentiate the sharing economy into those with offline competitors and those without offline competitors. With regard to the former, regulators are encouraged to embrace the sharing economy and meanwhile deregulate offline competitors. In relation to the latter, a three-condition analytical framework is proposed in order to strike a balance between promoting innovation and protecting the existing rights of others.

The design and development of a new digital device or system require a good understanding of the embedded system embed in it. In the context of engineering education, learning embedded systems remains a challenge for the millennial. As, it involves the implementation of mathematics, programming, and working knowledge of electronic and electrical components rooted in it. Traditional teaching pedagogy has become less useful for new-gen learners to satisfy their demand for knowledge of embedded systems. So, the teaching techniques have to be modified and equipped with the latest technological tools and practices. Augmented reality (AR) is emerging as a new technology in the field of engineering education. With the help of computer-generated 3D data, animation, visual effects, and immersion, this technology has become more prevalent in the education domain to make complex concepts easier to understand. In this paper, an augmented reality-based framework designed to teach embedded systems to engineering students. The proposed framework utilizes a tangible user interface comprising of AR markers, a USB camera, a display device, and the processing unit to give AR learning experience to the students. The system so developed tested for its usability with the faculty members of engineering education. Twenty faculty members, as participants, share their system usability experience and feedback using google form. The overall system usability score is 79.5%, which makes it suitable for further deployment on students for exploratory work.

The paper argues that companies engaged in such activities will find that there is a significant gap in precisely what aspects of the formal and informal institutional perspectives need to be identified and assessed for international expansion. The purpose of this paper is to develop a theoretical paradigm that allows organizations not only to compare different countries with regard to their potential for international business expansion from the perspective of Institutional Theory but also drawing on theories of International Business Strategy where relevant. The theoretical framework assumes that such organizations are engaged in analyzing the institutional arrangements and resources of their home and possible host countries. The paper then develops a conceptual framework that identifies five major components, namely people, power, performance, pathways to international expansion, and productivity, the latter being defined in terms of knowledge and innovation. It explores each of these areas in more depth with the aim of adding a more detailed structure to elements of Institutional Theory relevant to international business expansion.

However, understanding the spatial spillover effects of carbon emissions will help the government achieve this goal. This paper selects the carbon-emission intensity panel data of 11 provinces in the Yangtze River Economic Belt from 2004 to 2016. Then, this paper uses the Global Moran's I to explore the spatial distribution characteristics and spatial correlation of carbon emission intensity. Furthermore, this paper constructs a spatial econometric model to empirically test the driving path and spillover effects of relevant factors. The results show that there is a significant positive correlation with the provincial carbon intensity in the Yangtze River Economic Belt, but this trend is weakening. The provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai are High-High agglomerations, while the provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou are Low-Low agglomerations. Economic development, technological innovation, and foreign direct investion (FDI) have positive effects on the reduction of carbon emissions, while industrialization has a negative effect on it. There is also a significant positive spatial spillover effect of the industrialization level and technological innovation level. The spatial spillover effects of FDI and economic development on carbon emission intensity fail to pass a significance test. Therefore, it is necessary to promote cross-regional low-carbon development, accelerate the R&D of energy-saving and emission-reduction technologies, actively enhance the transformation and upgrade industrial structures, and optimize the opening up of the region and the patterns of industrial transfer.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16224452,WOS,Journal

A micro-level analysis of two radical ideas from unusual sources contributes to AC and radical innovation literatures by exploring relationships between SIMs and four AC capabilities (acquisition, assimilation, transformation, and exploitation).

But successful innovation, scientific or commercial, requires the majority to adopt a new practice. Faster, better, cheaper products should in theory conquer the market, but often fail. The psychology of change is complex, and the follow the leader mentality, common in the field today, lends little trust to the process of disseminating new technology. Beyond product quality, timing has proven to be a key factor in the inception, design, and execution of new technologies. Although the first robotic surgery was performed in 1985, scant progress was seen until the era of minimally invasive surgery. This movement increased neurosurgeons' dependence on navigation and fluoroscopy, intensifying the drive for enhanced precision. Outside the field of medicine, various technology companies have made great progress in popularizing co-robots (cobots), augmented reality, and processor chips. This has helped to ease practicing surgeons into familiarity with and acceptance of these technologies. The adoption among neurosurgeons in training is a follow the leader phenomenon, wherein new surgeons tend to adopt the technology used during residency. In neurosurgery today, robots are limited to computers functioning between the surgeon and patient. Their functions are confined to establishing a trajectory for navigation, with task execution solely in the surgeon's hands. In this review, the authors discuss significant untapped technologies waiting to be used for more meaningful applications.

Examining the Black Box through MASEM,Journal of Product Innovation Management,,10.1111/jpim.12335,"Understanding how firms can promote exploratory and exploitative innovations is of high interest for both scholars and practitioners. Although a substantial body of research has emphasized that top management's transformational leadership is crucial to innovation, the mechanisms through which strategic leaders influence these distinct types of innovations remain unclear. Building on upper echelon and social learning theory, this study develops and empirically examines a model that investigates the mediating roles of three distinct strategic orientations (market, learning, and entrepreneurial orientation) on the relationship between transformational leadership and exploratory and exploitative innovation. Using meta-analytic methods combined with structural equation modeling, this study integrates findings from separate research streams, covering over 15 years of research, and using a sample of 215 effect sizes from 75 studies. The results from the partial mediation model reveal that transformational leaders play a key role in creating these specific strategic orientations which, in turn, support different innovation outcomes. Specifically, the findings indicate that transformational leaders promote exploitative innovations predominantly by building a market orientation, whereas they foster exploratory innovations by stimulating an entrepreneurial and a learning orientation. Hence, this study extends upper echelon research by uncovering the different mechanisms through which transformational leaders promote exploratory and exploitative innovations as it theoretically identifies and empirically validates the unique mediating roles of three specific strategic orientations. The results thus provide valuable insights for the challenging management of exploratory and exploitative innovations, as they provide a â€œguiding mapâ€ which reveals how transformational leaders from the top may use specific orientations to foster these distinct types of innovations.

Drawing on our experience of governance within Australian Indigenous cultures and specific work incidents as case studies, we explore tensions, triumphs and insights occurring during collaborative ventures intended to produce online learning activities. Our view is â€˜from the engine roomâ€™ - at that point where technology and design expertise reframe creative â€˜story boardsâ€™ into â€˜interactive learning experiencesâ€™ requiring productive harnessing of diversity. Creation of scenario-based learning environments requires an understanding of specific content, along with the array of available learning pathways. Appreciating pitfalls likely to hinder the design process is vital. Scenarios use specific, and specialized artefacts and technologies to create interactive learning environments; computer-based technologies make the process even more complex, requiring highly specialized skills to contribute particular elements. More and more people are involved, and a greater number of specializations contribute to the final product. We draw on Human Computer Interaction practices to explore designer - developer interfaces and explore what may be involved in developing aware, conscious leadership of this emergent complexity.

Moreover, complex assimilation models often require numerous evaluations of physical solvers to evaluate these uncertainties, limiting their use for some real-time operational applications. For problems with high uncertainty and vast amounts of measurements available such as hydraulics, a new emerging paradigm has been gaining traction in recent years, namely the data-driven approach. Based mostly on machine learning techniques, these optimization techniques aim to build fast surrogate models entirely inferred from the data. Indeed, a large variety of function classes are available today in this context, and can be rapidly tested to find those who best match the underlying trends in the data. In this approach, these trends are therefore not hand-designed by physicists, but selected based on performance on a given dataset. In this study, we explore the possibility of building a predictor for river height at an observation point based on drainage basin time series data. An array of data-driven techniques is assessed for this task, including statistical models, machine learning techniques and deep neural network approaches. These are assessed on several metrics, offering an overview of the possibilities related to hydraulic time-series. An important finding is that for the same hydraulic quantity, the best predictors vary depending on whether the data is produced using a physical model or real observations.

Hence, exploring the antecedents of innovation performance becomes more important. This study analyses the relationships among innovation stimulus, facilitating factors and support mechanisms for innovative performance in the textile industry of Santa Catarina, Brazil. The sample included 128 respondents, who were all employees of five small and medium-sized textile firms; data were analysed using structural equation modelling. We found that innovation stimulus, facilitating factors and support mechanisms are correlated, while support mechanisms have no influence on innovation performance. The results also highlight a concern regarding the cost and time spent on developing innovation projects. This research contributes to innovation performance literature by analysing innovation antecedents including visions of innovation as both a process, represented by efficiency, and a result, represented by efficacy.

This article offers a framework to analyse these factors and their effect on the innovation capacity of networks in sustainable agriculture. We consider both internal and external dimensions of innovation, and also their interplay in a dynamic system. We describe the internal factors that shape the functioning of innovation networks in terms of organizational dynamism, while external factors are examined in terms of relational dynamism.

Considering that the multiple-dominant-logic system will change with the development of a firm, this paper focuses on exploring how the evolution of multiple-dominant-logic system affects the way managers choose to balance ambidextrous innovation.

When two humans are involved in such a task, they cooperate through different modalities to understand the interaction states during operation and mutually adapt to one another's actions. Mutual adaptation implies that both partners can identify how well they collaborate (i.e. infer about the interaction state) and act accordingly. These interaction states can define whether the partners work in harmony, face conflicts, or remain passive during interaction. Understanding how two humans work together during physical interactions is important when exploring the ways a robotic assistant should operate under similar settings. This study acts as a first step to implement an automatic classification mechanism during ongoing collaboration to identify the interaction state during object co-manipulation. The classification is done on a dataset consisting of data from 40 subjects, who are partnered to form 20 dyads.

This paper explores a novel front in design research inspired by Norman and Stappersâ€™s 2015 article â€œDesignX: Complex Sociotechnical Systems.â€ The aim here is to depict the transient knowledge structure of an interdisciplinary domain started from inside design. The present empirical study uses mixed methods combining the VOSviewer knowledge mapping technique with text-based qualitative analysis. Results from these quantitative and qualitative methods frame rich insights into patterns of knowledge diffusion and integration in DesignX-related research.

However, most existing works still concentrate on learning knowledge graph embeddings straightforwardly and intuitively without subtly considering the context of knowledge. Specifically, recent models deal with each single triple independently or consider contexts indiscriminately, which is one-sided as each knowledge unit (i.e., triple) can be derived from its partial surrounding triples. In this paper, we propose a graph-attention-based model to encode entities, which formulates a knowledge graph as an irregular graph and explores a number of concrete and interpretable knowledge compositions by integrating the graph-structured information via multiple independent channels. To measure the correlation between entities from different angles (i.e., entity pair, relation, and structure), we respectively develop three attention metrics. By making use of our enhanced entity embeddings, we further introduce several improved factorization functions for updating relation embeddings and evaluating candidate triples. We conduct extensive experiments on downstream tasks including entity classification, entity typing, and link prediction to validate our methods. Empirical results validate the importance of our introduced attention metrics and demonstrate that our proposed method can improve the performance of factorization models on large-scale knowledge graphs.

Our results show that implementing ambidexterity in creativity methods increases the firm's propensity to innovate and to introduce a market novelty. However, the effect on firm turnover is not always clear. Also, we detect that ambidexterity is more effective in firms that are large in size, have high levels of R&D investment and operate in manufacturing sectors.

The emerging environmental protection (EP) industry has become prominent recently because it has set high standards for technology and equipment, and has been tasked to provide solutions to difficult environmental problems. In this paper we looked at the performance of the EP industry using econometric software, intellectual capital architecture and data collected from 35 Chinese enterprises for 2010 through 2014. Intellectual capital (IC) is subdivided into human capital (HC), innovation capital (INC) and structure capital (SC). Using the Value Added Intellectual Capital coefficient (VAIC), we have built a multiple regression model to explore the relationship between the performance of IC and EP. We found that while the human and structural components of IC exert a significant positive influence on enterprise performance, innovation capital does not. We have offered suggestions for performance improvements to the EP industry through IC management.

A New Framework for Evaluating Policy Options,POLICY AND INTERNET,,10.1002/poi3.177,"The economic and societal impact of digital platforms raises a number of questions for policymakers, including whether existing regulatory approaches and instruments are sufficient to promote and safeguard public interests. This article develops a practical framework that provides structure and guidance to policymakers who design policies for the digital economy. The framework differs from other approaches in taking the digital business models of platforms as the starting point for the analysis. The framework consists of three pillars, namely determining a platform's characteristics, relating these to public interests, and formulating policy options. The framework then invokes a return-path analysis for assessing how the interventions affect the business model, whether it has the desired effect on public interests, and ensuring it has no undesired side-effects on public interests. The framework puts forward two key messages for current discussions on digital platforms. First, one should look at the underlying characteristics of platforms rather than trying to understand digital platforms as a single category. Second, policymakers should explore existing rules and policy options, as they seem fit to deal with several characteristics of digital platforms in a time frame that matches the rapid development of platform technologies and business models. ?",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/poi3.177,WOS,Journal

(2020),Impact of participatory sorghum breeding in Burkina Faso,AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS,,10.1016/j.agsy.2019.102775,"An ex post analysis of the impact of research projects related to Participatory Breeding (PB) of sorghum in Burkina Faso was carried out in 2015 and 2016 using the Impress method developed by CIRAD. The sorghum PB approach emerged in Burkina Faso in the late 1990s as a response to the very low adoption of improved varieties released by the conventional breeding program. This approach represents a paradigm shift from a research approach focused solely on the development of high-yielding varieties, irrespective of the social context in which these varieties are to be used, towards the development of varieties, seed and their dissemination within a multi-stakeholder framework. The present study aims to assess the impact of the sorghum PB program and the activities related to seed production and dissemination carried out in Burkina Faso over a period of 20 years. Detailed mappings of the timeline and the actors that have been involved in the innovation process, as well as the impact pathway, have been established. The causal relationships between outputs, outcomes and impacts have been developed on the basis of 67 impact descriptors provided by research partners and beneficiaries during participatory workshops. Around thirty measurable impact indicators were assessed by means of individual or focusgroup interviews and by means of secondary data sources. The three major outputs of the study were: the new improved varieties (IV) resulting from the PB actions; the mini-pack seed strategy; and the new skills acquired by the farmer organizations regarding sorghum improvement and certified seed production. The appropriation of these outputs by the farmer organizations not only brought structure to the experimentation networks, but also ensured the promotion and dissemination of the new varieties, and the establishment of a decentralised certified seed production scheme. One major positive impact was the significant increase in the use of sorghum IVs not only in the villages covered by the program but also in neighbouring areas. The expansion and performance of these new IVs has helped reduce the hunger gap while increasing the revenues of farmers involved in seed production. Furthermore, the research projects helped bring structure to the national seed sector as well as to the certified seed market, where the farmer seed production Unions consolidated by the PB projects now play an important role in the orientation of national legislation. The experimental method of impact assessment used in this analysis explores and makes visible the complex multidimensional and multi-stakeholder processes that have helped shape technological innovation and its impact on development. Such impact assessments can also elucidate the role of research in reinforcing the individual and collective capacities needed for innovating and testing out new technologies, that is, new varieties and seed production practices according to local constraints and/or opportunities.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2019.102775,WOS,Journal

With the use of a city-level panel data of 285 Chinese cities from 2003 to 2017, this study preliminary explores the impacts of environmental regulation, FDI, and its interaction term on urban innovation at national and regional levels. Specifically, based on the spatial Durbin model under the space-and-time fixed effect, three different spatial weight matrixes (i.e. the first-order adjacency, the inverse distance, and the economic distance) are utilized to check the robustness of the results under different standards. The results indicate that the impacts of FDI and environmental regulation on urban innovation have not achieved the desired goal without the other's cooperation, while most of its interaction term's coefficients on urban innovation are significantly positive, which provides robust support for the establishment of Porter hypothesis in China. Moreover, spatial heterogeneity is established, and the uneven development of urban innovation among different regions deserves more attention. In order to effectively increase the ability of urban innovation in China, the government should focus on such solutions as enhancing the implementation and supervision efficiency of environmental regulation, optimizing the structure of FDI, improving the synergistic effects of environmental regulation and FDI, and establishing a multi-scale spatial cooperation mechanism based on both geographical and economic correlations.

Emerging technologies have entered the gamut of resources which firms need to actively forecast and manage for competitive advantage. This study explored the idea of competitive advantage in the context of health insurance firms and how emerging technologies can augment existing capabilities towards this goal. The critical nature of health insurance as a social necessity and the application of emerging technologies in healthcare justified the need to theoretically establish what competencies were required for health insurance firms for technology driven competitive advantage. A qualitative method using modified Delphi technique in sequential combination to 43 in-depth expert interviews was used to explicate the factors. Data was analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative content and thematic intensity analysis. Organizational people orientation and service delivery capabilities emerged as foundations of a contemporary competitive advantage framework for health insurance firms supported by technical expertise, knowledge management practices and product innovation strategies. Results indicated that management of emerging technologies exerted a gravitational effect on firm competencies to create a contemporary competitive advantage framework. This study enriched the knowledge on competitive advantage by integrating new day technological imperatives with traditional firm competencies.

In this context, it is essential to support people with computational mechanisms that allow them to retrieve and interpret information in an appropriate way, as communication in these software systems is typically asynchronous and textual. Userâ€™s intention recognition and analysis in textual documents results in benefits for better information retrieval. However, intentions are expressed implicitly in texts in natural language and the specificities of the domain and cultural aspects of language make it difficult to process and analyze the text by computer systems. This requires the study of methods for the automatic recognition of intention classes in text. In this article, we conduct extensive experimental analyses on techniques based on language models and machine learning to detect instances of intention classes in texts about sustainable agriculture written in Portuguese. In our methodology, we perform a morphological analysis of the sentences and evaluate four Word Embeddings techniques (Word2Vec, Wang2Vec, FastText and Glove) combined with four machine learning techniques (Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network, Random Forest and Transfer Learning).

We will show you how you can use it to significantly reduce the time to achieve your organizational goals while reducing geotechnical risk and uncertainty and optimize the cycle time from Lead to Production. Outputs include a comprehensive analysis of your entire 3D Seismic Data Volume to identify and high grade, quality leads and prospects with high resource potential in the near, medium and long term. This approach will allow an evaluation of the field geological risk (reservoir distribution, trap, seal, source, hydrocarbon migration pathway from source into reservoir) and initial possible hydrocarbon content/type evaluation (e.g. DHI evaluation) without disrupting your current workflow. The results will quickly delineate possible structural and stratigraphic targets. This will also provide the Production Asset with additional support in their appraisal and development drilling programmes. Optimally place horizontal wells and injectors / offtakes in Improved Oil Recovery/Enhanced Oil Recovery (IOR / EOR) projects in areas of the field having the highest reservoir continuity to optimize the cycle time from concept to production. The case studies and examples presented will demonstrate how the technology and approach serve to increase the probability of success leading to increased capital efficiency and profitability.

The results show that, overall, China's rare earth industry technological innovation ability has continued to increase in terms of the breadth and depth, and the industrial chain has shown the characteristics of strong upper and weaker lower. The network structure analysis show that the overall technical connection network tends to be close and stable, but it is still in a state of weak connection. In terms of individual networks, technologies represented by the development, extraction and smelting of rare earth resources constitute the core participants in the innovation network, and play the role of the power and control center of the technological innovation network. Further factors identification shows that China's innovation environment is the biggest driving force for technological innovation in the rare earth industry, followed by R&D investment and resource retention capacity.

Learning plays an important role in BRBES to upgrade its knowledge base and parameters values, necessary for the improvement of the prediction accuracy. Different optimal training procedures such as Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), Differential Evolution (DE), and Genetic Algorithm (GA) have been used as learning mechanisms. Among these procedures, DE performs comparatively better than others. However, DE's performance depends significantly in assigning near optimal values to its control parameters including cross over and mutation factors. Therefore, the objective of this article is to present a novel optimal training procedure by integrating DE with BRBES. This is named as enhanced belief rule-based adaptive differential evolution (eBRBaDE) algorithm because it has the ability to determine the near-optimal values of both the control parameters while ensuring the balanced exploitation and exploration in the search space. In addition, a new joint optimization learning mechanism by using eBRBaDE is presented where both parameter and structure of BRBES are considered. The reliability of the eBRBaDE has been compared with evolutionary optimization algorithms such as GA, PSO, BAT, DE and L-SHADE. This comparison has been carried out by taking account of both conjunctive and disjunctive BRBESs while predicting the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) of a datacentre. The comparison demonstrates that the eBRBaDE provides higher prediction accuracy of PUE than from other evolutionary optimization algorithms. Contribution-An enhanced differential evolution algorithm has been proposed in this paper, which is later used as a novel optimal training procedure for BRBES.

Management scholars taking a paradoxical lens have predominantly focused on social paradoxes within the confines of the organization. Technological change has often been treated as an exogenous force bringing previously latent tensions to the fore. Such newly salient paradoxes are viewed as instigating managerial sensemaking and exploration of strategic responses that will re-establish equilibrium. Our investigation of how digital innovations disrupted London taxiwork and global music distribution shows something different. The paradoxical tensions raised by emerging digital technologies inevitably play out at industry and societal levels. Concomitant changes in boundaries, categories, and potentials for action that shape and channel ongoing industry transformation call for organizational responses and adaptation. Critically, such tensions must be interpreted within the context of industry arrangements absent a centrally controlling actor. Rather than episodes of exogenous change, the nature of the digital, along with interactions across multiple sources of agency, continually surface complex dynamic and systemic tensions within and across industries. Our findings highlight the importance of explicitly accounting for the inter-relatedness and mutual dependence of the social and technical elements of change. As digital innovation expands and starts to impact all aspects of human experience it is critical for management scholars to reflect how the paradoxical perspective can be expanded to better understand these contemporary large-scale changes.

We cross research on disruptive innovation with research on managerial cognition and we focus on the role of managerial beliefs about customer needs in directing the search for new markets and product features. We show that a primary reason why incumbents lose their leadership is the inability to recognize either the rising 'social' market, where customers use products for fulfilling their need for friendship, or the 'esteem' market, where customers use products for fulfilling their need for achievement. We then apply our emerging conceptual framework to the case of the smartphone industry and the ongoing rivalry among operating systems. We thus try to advance the disruptive innovation theory with regard to both the explanation and the anticipation of technology competition outcomes.

The previously studied underwater robot uses the propeller as the propulsion power, which has the disadvantages of large noise pollution, short endurance, unstable movement and high cost. At the same time, it also causes certain damage to the marine environment. In order to solve the above problems, the design of this paper is based on the multi-link to develop the underwater working robot with jellyfish as the prototype. The jellyfish uses the contraction and expansion of the bell body to provide the driving force. Its movement speed is slow, with high flexibility, simple structure and strong environmental adaptability.

It effectively reduces the cell size, and makes significant energy reduction and scalability improvement. New applications such as associative processors/accelerators are facilitated by the emergence of the nonvolatile TCAM (nvTCAM). However, nvTCAM design is challenging. In addition to the emerging device's uncertainty, the nvTCAM cell structure is so diverse that it results in a design space too large to explore manually. To tackle these challenges, we propose a circuit-level model and develop a simulation tool, NVSim-CAM, which helps researchers to make early design decisions, and to evaluate device/circuit innovations. The tool is validated by HSPICE simulations and data from fabricated chips. We also present a case study to illustrate how NVSim-CAM benefits the nvTCAM design.

And the design of these equipment, in turn, requires the use of machine elements, mechanisms, and structures that are widely used in engineering, such as wire ropes, gears, pulleys, bolted connections, structural profiles, etc. In this work, a rotary wall crane was built in a virtual environment. The design was based mainly on the ABNT NBR 8400 standard. The software used for 3D modeling was Autodesk InventorÂ® and the main structure of the equipment was analyzed, according to its functionality, using numerical simulations based on the finite element method. Firstly, the structure of the crane, consisting of L and U structural profiles, bolted joints, structural reinforcements and other connections, was analyzed separately. Static structural simulations were conducted in this subassembly. Concomitantly, structural calculations were performed using statics and vector mechanics methods and by the finite element analysis. In this case, the Direct Stiffness Method was used to determine the tensions in the structural elements, displacements and reaction forces. For these calculations, the MATLABÂ® software was used. The Direct Stiffness Method and computational results have presented coherent adherence. After the verification of the results, improvements were proposed to the project, in order to provide a more appropriate operation regime and safety to the equipment. In addition, the issues that cause the results to be slightly different were discussed. This work intends to present an application of the Direct Stiffness Method to the literature and to discuss the real conditions in which it can be used in load-lifting equipment, as well as to explore, in the same context, numerical solutions obtained using the finite element method.

Nevertheless, the water sector has been claimed to be less innovative than other sectors. This Special Volume on the dynamics of water innovation is based on the realization that, in general, there is a striking absence of academic studies on the dynamics of water innovation. This SV is therefore designed to lay the foundations for the field of water innovation studies, in an effort to integrate the emerging insights. Together, the contributions in this SV capture the current understanding of the dynamics of water innovation and provide insights into how the water innovation process can be fostered. The purpose of this introductory article is threefold, namely to frame the discussion on water innovation dynamics in order to contextualise the contributions of this SV, to provide systematic guidance for studying water innovation dynamics and to suggest the way forward for water innovation studies. It captures the extent of the field of water innovation studies with a review of the literature of the last three decades and frames water innovations. Based on five decades of innovation research and drawing on three areas (management, strategy and policy), we provide an innovation studies taxonomy that consists of four organising dimensions: type of innovation, stage of innovation, level of analysis and measurement. This taxonomy enables researchers to study the dynamics of water innovation from different combinations of conceptual and thematic angles, drawing on the field of innovation studies in a systematic fashion. Finally, we reflect on the way forward for water innovation studies with suggestions for future research.

Recently, knowledge graph (KG) attracts much attention in RS due to its abundant connective information. Existing methods either explore independent meta-paths for user-item pairs over KG, or employ graph neural network (GNN) on whole KG to produce representations for users and items separately. Despite effectiveness, the former type of methods fails to fully capture structural information implied in KG, while the latter ignores the mutual effect between target user and item during the embedding propagation. In this work, we propose a new framework named Adaptive Target-Behavior Relational Graph network (ATBRG for short) to effectively capture structural relations of target user-item pairs over KG. Specifically, to associate the given target item with user behaviors over KG, we propose the graph connect and graph prune techniques to construct adaptive target-behavior relational graph. To fully distill structural information from the sub-graph connected by rich relations in an end-to-end fashion, we elaborate on the model design of ATBRG, equipped with relation-aware extractor layer and representation activation layer. We perform extensive experiments on both industrial and benchmark datasets. Empirical results show that ATBRG consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Learning from imbalanced data is challenging as most standard algorithms fail to properly represent the inherent complex characteristics of the data distribution. As an emerging technology, the extreme learning machine (ELM) and its variants, including the weighted ELM (WELM) and the boosting weighted ELM (BWELM), have been recently developed for the classification of imbalanced data. However, the WELM suffers the following deficiencies: (i) the sample weight matrix is manually chosen and fixed during the learning phase; (ii) the representation capability, namely the capability to extract features or useful information from the original data, is insufficiently explored due to its shallow structure. The BWELM employs the AdaBoost algorithm to optimize the sample weights. But the representation capability is still restricted by the shallow structure. To alleviate these deficiencies, we propose a novel deep weighted ELM (DWELM) algorithm for imbalanced data classification in this paper. An enhanced stacked multilayer deep representation network trained with the ELM (EH-DrELM) is first proposed to improve the representation capability, and a fast AdaBoost algorithm for imbalanced multiclass data (AdaBoost-ID) is developed to optimize the sample weights. Then, the novel DWELM for the imbalance learning is obtained by combining the above two algorithms. Experimental results on nine imbalanced binary-class datasets, nine imbalanced multiclass datasets, and five large benchmark datasets (three for multiclass and two for binary-class) show that the proposed DWELM achieves a better performance than the WELM and BWELM, as well as several state-of-the-art multilayer network-based learning algorithms.

The CCDSF extends and unifies three existing frameworks: (i) the Functionâ€“Behaviorâ€“Structure framework for designing, to integrate design domain-specific knowledge; (ii) the Creative Systems Framework, to model design as a creative process; and (iii) the Conceptual Spaces Theory framework, to define the CCDSF at a more neutral level to be compatible with both the conceptual-space nature of the creative process and the implementation-level representation systems. The CCDSF core is a layered schema that structures the activity of designing through design concepts produced by design processes instrumented by agent-specific perception and action strategies, within a hierarchy of what we call design levels. Each layer of the schema constitutes a creative system that can implement exploratory, combinational, and transformational creativity mechanisms, including the possibility of defining the system at a meta-creative level. The hierarchical arrangement of creative systems defines the architecture of a CCDS. This architecture enables modeling CCDSs considering both the perspective of the generation and evaluation of artifacts that could be deemed creative and the precise modeling of the cognitive process of design, emphasizing its situated nature.

This revolutionary technology is dramatically changing business and innovation models, shrinking supply chains and altering the global economy. For example, 3D printing shifts production locations closer to customers and leads to free-form product design as well as sustainable manufacturing. Several studies have been conducted on AM technology, but the research stream on AM management is still developing, with studies dispersed in journals across different research areas. Our study presents both systematic and quantitative analyses of the literature, including co-citation analysis, factor analysis and multidimensional scaling, to explore the structure of the AM research domains in the scope of management, business and economics. We found eight main research streams: AM technology selection, supply chain, product design and production cost models, environmental aspects, strategic challenges, manufacturing systems, open-source innovation and business models and economics. Finally, based on the results of our in-depth analysis of the literature, we found nine promising future research directions.",2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2016.1229064,WOS,Journal

Metasurfaces comprise optimized geometries of unit cells arranged as a periodic lattice to obtain a desired EM response. One of their emerging application areas is the stealth technology, in particular, realization of radar cross section (RCS) reduction. Despite potential benefits, a practical obstacle hindering widespread metasurface utilization is the lack of systematic design procedures. Conventional approaches are largely intuition-inspired and demand heavy designer's interaction while exploring the parameter space and pursuing optimum unit cell geometries. Not surprisingly, these are unable to identify truly optimum solutions. In this article, we introduce a novel machine-learning-based framework for automated and computationally efficient design of metasurfaces realizing broadband RCS reduction. Our methodology is a three-stage procedure that involves global surrogate-assisted optimization of the unit cells, followed by their local refinement. The last stage is direct EM-driven maximization of the RCS reduction bandwidth, facilitated by appropriate formulation of the objective function involving regularization terms. The appealing feature of the proposed framework is that it optimizes the RCS reduction bandwidth directly at the level of the entire metasurface as opposed to merely optimizing unit cell geometries. Computational feasibility of the optimization process, especially its last stage, is ensured by high-quality initial designs rendered during the first two stages. To corroborate the utility of our procedure, it has been applied to several metasurface designs reported in the literature, leading to the RCS reduction bandwidth improvement by 15%-25% when compared with the original designs. Furthermore, it was used to design a novel metasurface featuring over 100% of relative bandwidth. Although the procedure has been used in the context of RCS design, it can be generalized to handle metasurface development for other application areas.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2021.3061128,WOS,Journal

Results from this larger research project were previously published in this journal, where pupilsâ€™ readiness for Self-Regulated Learning were reported. Since then, pupilsâ€™ experiences of classroom techniques, attitudes towards the subject, leisure time interests and learning within the two domains of the subject (Technical Domain and Textile Domain, as the subject is usually divided in Finland) have been studied and results have been published in different journals. In this article, a new Structural Equation Model concludes the previous results. The new model highlights two paths of how the use of different learning orientations can predict successful learning outcomes. These paths can be followed using two pedagogical models: the Exploratory Production Approach and the Domain Specific Approach. Experiencing Learner-Centred Learning predicts positive attitudes and success in Exploratory Production activities. Experiencing Collaborative Learning predicts success in domain specific learning outcomes. Success in Exploratory Production predicts successful learning outcomes in both domains. The conclusion is that regulatory knowledge, â€œwhyâ€, is related to production activities and it is processed prior to domain specific knowledge, â€œwhatâ€ and â€œhowâ€. To develop the subject and pedagogy for schools and teacher training, it is not important to follow an approach defined by the domains (technical or textile). It is more important to teach pupils how to manage in the modern technological world and to understand why they need to be able to improve their life-world through Exploratory Production activities.

However, from the perspective of Artificial Intelligence, education governance modernization is not only stuck in the 'structural' absence of multiple governance subjects, but also trapped in the 'initiative' shortage of vertical one-way organizational structure and the 'data' block of modern education governance paradigm. Thus, the application of Artificial Intelligence in intelligently mining data and information, autonomously adapting to complex educational situations, and systematically optimizing governance decisionmaking behavior is limited. This paper explores the optimized path of education governance from three dimensions of concept cultivation, subject training and technology innovation, rationally discusses the 'interactive' application of Artificial Intelligence and education governance modernization, so as to promote the deep integration of artificial intelligence and education governance, and improve education governance modernization as well as talent cultivation in the new era.

In this article, we maintain that design science provides a useful theoretical foundation for understanding the development of novel strategies by shifting strategists' perspective from what is to what could be, from the past and present to the future, and from choosing among existing alternatives to discovering new problems and solutions. We propose a structured process based on design mechanisms, which enables strategists to overcome the impediments to generating novel strategies that have been identified in prior research. The process we theorize integrates (a) strategists' shaping intentions to transform an existing situation into a preferred one, (b) discovery-oriented exploration of problems and solutions based on designing without final goals, and (c) stakeholder dialogue to validate and extend novelty and value.

Data is processed with automated labelling pipelines rather than providing it as input to the system. The innovative nature increases the overall performance of monitoring/detection/reaction mechanisms for efficient system resource management. However, due to hardware-driven design limitations, networking and trust mechanisms are not flexible and adaptive enough to be able to interact and control the resources dynamically. Novel adaptive software-driven design approaches can enable us to build growing intelligent mechanisms with software-defined networking (SDN) features by virtualizing network functionalities with maximized features. These challenges and critical feature sets have been identified and introduced into this survey with their scientific background for AI systems and growing intelligent mechanisms.

The challenges are categorized according to three defined architectural perspectives (central, decentral/autonomous, distributed/hybrid) for emerging trusted distributed AI mechanisms. Therefore, resiliency and robustness can be assured in a dynamic context with an end-to-end Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for growing intelligent mechanisms and systems.

Each pathway is activated at the inner world of individuals and cascades through the outer levels (individual and collective) of the iceberg model, ultimately resulting in transformations of the individual's relationship with others, non-humans, or oneself. Our main purpose is to empirically investigate the activation of inner leverage points among graduate students who are alumni of an Indigenous language field school in the Ecuadorian Amazon. Semi-structured interviews designed around three core aspects-(1) human-nature relationships; (2) subjective change; and (3) acknowledgment for Indigenous culture-yielded expressions of becoming aware of new forms of relationships and empirically illustrate the roles of deep leverage points in triggering the three inside-out pathways of our model.

However, in current studies, preferential probability has been mostly related to node degree, and there has been little consideration of multi-attribute decision-making based on complex system characteristics (multi-level, multi-traffic, etc.). Furthermore, association analysis of driving forces and the topology structure of the complex system should be highlighted to explore the operating mechanism.

To address this issue, we propose a learner modelling mechanism for monitoring learners' actions when constructing/exploring models by modelling sequences of actions reflecting different strategies in solving a task. This is based on a modified version of case-based reasoning for problems with multiple solutions. In our formulation, approaches to explore the task are represented as sequences of simple cases linked by temporal and dependency relations, which are mapped to the learners' behavior in the system by means of appropriate similarity metrics.

Objectives: We explored perspectives of key informants to assess PHNCIâ€™s work in its first 5 years, including implementation of activities, outputs, accomplishments, and opportunities. Design: This qualitative study involved a Web site review; secondary document review; 15 interviews with 17 key informants purposively sampled from 2 groupsâ€”PHNCI and PHAB staff and leadership (PHNCI respondents), and external partners and collaborators (external respondents); and thematic analysis of qualitative data. Setting: United States. Results: PHNCI implemented its planned activities over the past 5 yearsâ€”including grant programs and learning communities; large-scale public health initiatives; conferences, events, and convenings; webinar trainings; and resources, tools, and materialsâ€”resulting in more than 150 outputs. According to key informants, PHNCIâ€™s major accomplishments were as follows: contributed to an increased understanding and awareness of innovation in the public health field; provided grants and learning communities to support innovation; developed and disseminated materials to help practitioners innovate; established partnerships and promoted cross-sector collaboration; supported systems transformation; incorporated innovation into public health accreditation; and focused efforts to advance health equity. Conclusions: Going forward, PHNCI should continue to prioritize its core activities that support public health innovation and transformation; expand its work by addressing innovation in new public health topic areas; strengthen and expand its cross-sector work, partnerships, and activities to advance health equity and antiracism; and increase its visibility and reach, particularly within other sectors. Continued commitment and leadership are important for strengthening the capacity of the public health system to innovate, respond to ongoing and emerging public health threats and challenges, and advance health equity.

However, due to the unique nature of healthcare built environments, the critical application of this evidence is of paramount importance. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the features of such critical application and identify the aspects that need to be considered during the re-use of good designs. Design/methodology/approach: Data from three case studies of hospital designs in the UK were used to explore the processes behind the adaption and re-use of design solutions during the design of healthcare buildings. Data were thematically analysed to distinguish the aspects that should be carefully compared and contrasted during design re-use. Findings: Existing designs of healthcare buildings should be captured and evaluated along with: patient demographics, care models of the hospital, other local departmental needs and facility operational aspects in order to ensure the effectiveness of re-use. In addition, properly introducing the design to the users is also a part of successful design re-use. Research limitations/implications: The findings of this research were integrated into a framework to support healthcare designers on the effective re-use of good designs. This data-driven framework could be validated further with design practitioners. Further, this research relied on memory recall of the interviewees and the accuracy and completeness of documentary records. Practical implications: This research provides details of how healthcare built environment designs are embedded in project-unique circumstances. The results could therefore be used to develop meaningful and informative evaluation mechanisms for new and re-used healthcare building design features. Originality/value: This research extends the understanding of the critical application of healthcare design evidence, by explaining how healthcare design solutions should be evaluated during the design process.

(2019),Innovation and convergence/divergence: searching the technology landscape,AIAA Aviation 2019 Forum,,,"Technology convergence â€“ the combination of two or more technologies in a single device or product â€“ has historically led to radical social, economic, and industrial change. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the coming transformation of aviation through emerging technologies such as electric propulsion, autonomous systems, machine learning, and advanced computing. To better understand the implications of technology convergence relevant to aviation, NASA sponsored a study to (1) develop and demonstrate a repeatable methodology to identify areas of potential technology convergence impacting the future of aviation, and (2) explore the potential impact of converging technologies on selected future aeronautical concepts. The methodology applied cluster analysis and text mining techniques to identify candidate technologies, including those outside of traditional aviation sources, and their potential for application in four areas. The results were reviewed by subject matter experts and in structured workshops to rank technologies of interest and provide recommendations relevant to NASA research plans. The four areas were covered in successive cycles addressing on-demand mobility, control of airflow to reduce air vehicle noise, advanced concepts for vertical takeoff and landing propulsion, and advanced technologies for future air traffic management. The study demonstrated that searching for technologies with potential for convergence is an iterative process â€“ each search leads to deeper searches, different areas to be explored, or new questions. Quid proved to be a robust tool for analyzing the global technology landscape. The results revealed that, like any tool, the user has to know its capabilities and limitations: use cases and careful formulation of keywords were critical to obtaining the desired results, and search results must be combined with human knowledge and intuition for best results.

The study follows the recent addition of transparency to the ethics codes of two leading U.S. professional journalism associations: Society of Professional Journalists and Radio Television Digital News Association. The study includes a broad sampling of journalists working for both legacy and online media outlets, and explores the relationship between how journalists perceive transparency has been managed and the extent to which journalists practice transparency in their work. Results indicate journalists perceive transparency has not been a management priority, and how transparency is managed has a significant effect on the extent it is practiced. These results are consistent across media types, coverage areas, demographics and extent of professional experience.

In remote environments where diagnostic tools and medical attention are scarce, such as deep space exploration, the monitoring of the respiratory signal becomes crucial to timely detect life-threatening conditions. Nowadays, this signal can be measured using wearable technology; however, the use of such technology is often hampered by the low quality of the recordings, which leads more often to wrong diagnosis and conclusions. Therefore, to apply these data in diagnosis analysis, it is important to determine which parts of the signal are of sufficient quality. In this context, this study aims to evaluate the performance of a signal quality assessment framework, where two machine learning algorithms (support vector machineâ€“SVM, and convolutional neural networkâ€“CNN) were used. The models were pre-trained using data of patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The generalization capability of the models was evaluated by testing them on data from a different patient population, presenting normal and pathological breathing. The new patients underwent bariatric surgery and performed a controlled breathing protocol, displaying six different breathing patterns. Data augmentation (DA) and transfer learning (TL) were used to increase the size of the training set and to optimize the models for the new dataset. The effect of the different breathing patterns on the performance of the classifiers was also studied. The SVM did not improve when using DA, however, when using TL, the performance improved significantly (p < 0.05) compared to DA. The opposite effect was observed for CNN, where the biggest improvement was obtained using DA, while TL did not show a significant change. The models presented a low performance for shallow, slow and fast breathing patterns. These results suggest that it is possible to classify respiratory signals obtained with wearable technologies using pre-trained machine learning models. This will allow focusing on the relevant data and avoid misleading conclusions because of the noise, when designing bio-monitoring systems.

Caption generation from floor plan images has applications in indoor path planning, real estate, and providing architectural solutions. Several methods have been explored in the literature for generating captions or semi-structured descriptions from floor plan images. Since only the caption is insufficient to capture fine-grained details, researchers also proposed descriptive paragraphs from images. However, these descriptions have a rigid structure and lack flexibility, making it difficult to use them in real-time scenarios. This paper offers two models, description synthesis from image cue (DSIC) and transformer-based description generation (TBDG), for text generation from floor plan images. These two models take advantage of modern deep neural networks for visual feature extraction and text generation. The difference between both models is in the way they take input from the floor plan image. The DSIC model takes only visual features automatically extracted by a deep neural network, while the TBDG model learns textual captions extracted from input floor plan images with paragraphs.

Ability-Based Design (ABD) is an approach to accessible design in the HCI literature that we found to be most appealing for this endeavour. ABD focuses on making systems adaptable to users' needs and abilities rather than making the user conform to system requirements. We explore principles of ABD in the context of two adaptive outdoor experiences: Tetra-Ski and Tetra-Sail. We found that while the general approach of ABD is useful in this context, some of the basic tenants of ABD can be confounded by: (1) activity risk, (2) dynamic sport environments, and (3) the role of psychological fow during the activity. To accommodate these restrictions on ABD principles and provide a usable experience we developed Shared-Control as a collaborative approach to implementation. This paper explores using Shared-Control and ABD principles in the context of these two adaptive recreation systems for individuals with acquired tetraplegia. This perspective reveals tensions between ABD guidelines and designing for adaptive outdoor activities. We refect on these tensions, potential additions to ABD, and our own usage of Shared-Control as a mechanism for adhering to ABD principles in this context.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3357236.3395508,WOS,Conference Paper

Some of the existing methods focus on addressing the problem of fault data scarcity and fault knowledge transfer across different domains with different number of samples. There is still much room to improve considering the best performance so far on imbalanced and transfer fault diagnosis. The existing researches apply synthetic data generation, weighted sample or cost and transfer learning techniques to solve the problem. However, the synthetic samples might not follow the true fault data distribution or exploit excessively over the available small data which could lead to model bias or overfitting. In addition, the value of the abundant normal condition data has not been well explored which may carry essential information for fault discrimination. To address these problems, a novel two stage transferable common feature space mining method for fault diagnosis is developed which is termed as Common Feature and Compare Net (CFCNet). The fault diagnosis task has been divided into two stages, common feature learning and fault category diagnosis. In the first stage, CFCNet trains a weakly supervised domain adaptive convolutional Autoencoder to learn the common features underlying multi-domain data, which makes efficient use of all the available data and is termed as Common Feature Net. In the second stage, the trained Common Feature Net and a Unique Feature Net is combined to construct a dual-channel feature extraction and comparison architecture. CFCNet could mine both the transferable common features and unique features of different faults. Based on a feature concatenation and similarity computation structure, CFCNet enables an efficient similarity estimation mechanism for fault diagnosis. Training strategy of few shot learning is adopted to train CFCNet which can balance the training progress instead of the imbalanced data. Extensive experiments have verified the superior performance of the proposed method.

Despite the wide scale of medical innovation and the activity of researchers, inventors, and developers of effective medical solutions, the number of people with chronic diseases has been constantly growing, and this is a challenge for health systems around the world. A key requirement for patients to be able to self-manage their disease is patient empowerment. People become empowered to independently take decisions to manage the disease as well as to be in charge of it, mainly when they possess knowledge about their illness and can employ it in making such decisions. One of the vital steps for successful patient empowerment to manage their chronic disease is the possibility to access virtual communities of patients and to engage in their activities.The field of research on digital health communities is characterized by the research gap: patient health communities are not seen as enabling patient knowledge to self-manage their disease; therefore, the approach that patient health communities do not operate in isolation from the patient empowerment process, but are part of that process that encourages patients to evolve to the highest level of empowerment is not being developed. Motivators, barriers, and enablers of knowledge sharing specific to patient knowledge empowerment through digital communities are also not explored. Failure to disclose these aspects does not allow for understanding the patient knowledge empowerment through digital health communities. As a result of scientific literature analysis, a holistic model is presented that reveals what knowledge sharing motivators and enablers operate at each level of patient empowerment.

Ofwat, Defra and DWI have set targets for the water companies to be customer focused, reducing bills, be innovative as well as encourage competition. The emergence of Building Information Modelling (BIM) has offered opportunities to the water industry to achieve cost and programme efficiencies as the rest of the construction industry. This, together with emerging information technology has allowed organisations to take steps in collaborative working, making information available at the right time to the right people, which is fundamental to Knowledge Management (KM). There is limited research in the subject of BIM being used in the context of and tool for KM within the UK water industry. Hence the aim of the study is to explore and understand how the UK water industry is using BIM for KM. A qualitative case study was used for the collection and analysis of data with the results obtained through review of water company supply chain processes, documents, observations and semi structured interviews. The key finding from the study is the significant impact of organisational culture influence on the implementation of BIM & KM in which the water industry supply chain has been aligning its business goals, identifying needed knowledge, creating KM resources and sharing knowledge through BIM as one of KM resources or tools. In conclusion, research identifies that the water industry is heading in the right direction, with leadership and management at the forefront of instilling a positive KM culture, though it is still developing. Ongoing training and provision of resources for KM should continue to be invested in to yield cost, programme, quality and knowledge capture benefits. The close definitions for Information and Knowledge should be taken advantage of for development and implementing of KM strategies using BIM as one of its key tool or resource.

Consisting of multiple, regularly spaced, interleaved 1D CA, our model provides a mechanism to evolve flexible spatial units, where the 'cells' are not defined as programmatic elements but as 'form-making' elements. The efficacy of this approach is evaluated via a standard methodology, typically used in the study of complex adaptive systems. We systematically examine the dynamics of a series of instances of the composite CA by varying initial conditions and transition rules. A measure of entropy is used to validate emergent patterns. Subsequently, we investigate whether the composite CA is capable of generating aggregate spatial units to match specific spatial configurations, using a well-known example as a benchmark. This phase allows us to bring an understanding of the results into the context of architectural design.

During decision making process, agents can improve the strategy for interacting with the dynamic environment through reinforcement learning. Many state-of-the-art reinforcement learning models deal with relatively smaller number of state-action pairs, and the states are preferably discrete, such as Q-learning and Actor-Critic algorithms. While in practice, in many scenario, the states are continuous and hard to be properly discretized. Better autonomous decision making methods need to be proposed to handle these problems. Inspired by the mechanism of decision making in human brain, we propose a general computational model, named as prefrontal cortex-basal ganglia (PFC-BG) algorithm. The proposed model is inspired by the biological reinforcement learning pathway and mechanisms from the following perspectives: (1) Dopamine signals continuously update reward-relevant information for both basal ganglia and working memory in prefrontal cortex. (2) We maintain the contextual reward information in working memory. This has a top-down biasing effect on reinforcement learning in basal ganglia. The proposed model separates the continuous states into smaller distinguishable states, and introduces continuous reward function for each state to obtain reward information at different time. To verify the performance of our model, we apply it to many UAV decision making experiments, such as avoiding obstacles and flying through window and door, and the experiments support the effectiveness of the model. Compared with traditional Q-learning and Actor-Critic algorithms, the proposed model is more biologically inspired, and more accurate and faster to make decision.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12559-017-9511-3,WOS,Journal

As a still-evolving concept, the bioeconomy has been translated differently in different national contexts. In this article, we focus on the United States. The US bioeconomy comprises a highly decentralised, disconnected, fragmented system, with some US locales much more active than others. We argue that the marginal status of the US bioeconomy can be attributed to a number of factors. These include the lack of awareness and implementation of existing federal government visions; development pathway dependencies linked to investments in fossil- and bio-fuels to the neglect of other biobased products; and uneven and locked in levels of stakeholder power and influence. Drawing on the results of 16 key informant interviews, we explore these themes in an attempt to unravel some of the complex conditions that have shaped bioeconomy development and governance to date. We suggest that, for the US bioeconomy to realize its full potential, exploration of a new governance model is required: a polycentric regime based on biomass regions, collaborative efforts and innovation capabilities.

(2020),A study on the mechanism of new product diffusion under online social network context: Based on the process of peer influence,Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management,Adoption intention; Peer influence; Social networks; The new product diffusion,10.13587/j.cnki.jieem.2020.05.011,"Against the background of trade protectionism becoming more serious and the trade war upgrading among countries, innovation-driven development, as a new engine promoting economic structure transformation and upgrade, has gained widespread attention in the practical and theoretical circles. However, if an innovation is not widely applied, it will be difficult to have any real impact on the social economy. So only when an innovation diffused in the social system it can realize its true value. The diffusion of new products as an embodiment of innovation is the key to realize the value of innovation. It is also a basis for the innovation to have any influence on society. With the development of the Internet and Web2.0, social networks like WeChat, blogs, online community, and e-commerce's customer reviews that are characterized by user-generated content, have become more and more widely used. Social media increases interpersonal interdependence and makes interpersonal influence deeper and wider. The new product adopters, especially imitators, who account for 97.5% of all in the system (when innovation is fully diffused) adopt a new product because of interpersonal influence. Thus, interpersonal influence plays a vital role in the diffusion of a new product. Since information exchange occurs mainly among identical or similar individuals (peers), and this is the fundamental means of interpersonal communication, put it differently, individuals are more inclined to choose peers to communicate and interact. Hence, individuals are more influenced by peers than others, especially in the context of social networks; individuals can find and interact with peers who have the same interests or preferences more conveniently and efficiently. Therefore, peer influence on new product diffusion in social networks contexts is larger and deeper than in conventional contexts. How does peer influence play a role in the user's new product adoption intention formation? That is, what is the new product diffusion mechanism based on peer influence? The discussion of this question not only helps scholars to better grasp the cause and effect of the user's new product adoption but also helps the company to better implement the promotion and marketing strategies of new products based on peer influence. However, the existing researches either explore the process of new product diffusion in a certain social system from a macro perspective, such as the Bass model and its extension model or investigate influence factors of new product diffusion from a micro perspective, such as personal characteristics, external factors, and product innovation attributes. All of those have not explored the influence mechanism. For this reason, this study introduces peer influence, a concept from social psychology, into the field of innovation diffusion. Based on the relevant literature, and combined with the use gratification theory, this paper further perfects and supplements the formation process of peer influence, which is based on the influence process theory and the homogenization theory. Motivation drives the formation of peer influence. With peer interaction, peers are unnoticeably influenced to have homogeneous behaviors or opinions, or with interaction, mutual trust is formed, which results in homogeneous behaviors or opinions ultimately. Based on this process, a model was built to study new product diffusion under peer influence in the context of the social network. Data was acquired through the delivery on the network using the snowball method to test the model empirically. The model was revised based on the results of empirical analysis at last. The results show that for the new product diffusion, the information motivation and reward motivation of adopters are the antecedents. This conclusion shows that the new model used by the paper is a further improvement of the homogenization theory and the influence process theory. It shows that user-involved peer-to-peer communication about new products is not a purposeless behavior, but driven by the motivation to obtain more information or gain internal and external compensation to reduce the risk of adopting a new product and maximize the self-interest. Peer communication is the necessary link; the trust composing perceived similarity and benevolence plays a partial mediating role in peer communication and adaption intention and is the direct influence factor of new product diffusion. This conclusion further validates the explanatory power of homogenization theory in the new era, new situation, and new product diffusion field. The influence process theory is only a supplement to the homogenization theory. It cannot completely replace it, because perceived similarity and benevolence, as two dimensions of trust, play a partial mediating role in the new product diffusion, but not a fully mediating role. Peer communication does not influence adoption intention by a trust. In addition, the indirect effect value of the path of the mediating effect is relatively low. However, the trust established in communication plays an active role in the promoting users' willingness to adopt, is one of the direct influencing factors of the new product diffusion, and the higher the trust, the better the communication effect, and the greater the influence on the willingness to adopt.

Thus, the authors aim to understand whether the presence of digitalization forces companies to create, capture and deliver value in new ways, focusing on their social impact. Design/methodology/approach Through the analysis of a case study in the automotive sector, the authors provide evidence that both digitalization and sustainability need to be considered to adequately innovate business models. Moreover, these two dimensions are interrelated, and therefore digitalization sustains sustainability and vice versa. Findings By inductively investigating the evolutionary path along which companies tend to adapt their business models to digitalization and sustainability trends, the authors found that this innovative transformation needs to be as sustainable as possible in order to offer benefits to organizations, customers and society at large. Furthermore, the authors revealed that, at least in the automotive sector, companies and customers are aware of the remarkable consequences of digitalization; however, they are still uncertain regarding the actual adoption of new technologies. Originality/value The literature on business model innovation is quite extensive. However, the role of digitalization in developing sustainable business models to achieve a competitive advantage has been overlooked.

In contrast to conventional mobility, where an ecosystem consisting of the vehicle and complementary services has been built up and has improved over decades, the ecosystem for e-mobility is far less advanced and still in its infancy. In order to get on the sustainable path to success in the steadily growing e-mobility market, innovative ideas are necessary which are not covered by existing service offerings. This paper therefore describes a study that explored opportunities for innovative e-mobility service business models through a systematic analysis. Furthermore, each e-mobility service depends on information technology (IT) support. Therefore, IT standardization is an important issue to consider in order to build up more complex services on top of basic services and further advance the e-mobility ecosystem. Consequently, this paper presents results from a survey conducted with 27 e-mobility experts from Germany to help identify necessary standardization gaps in the context of e-mobility services.

In the early design phase, in particular, the time intensity and the cognitive load associated with optimization and form parametrization are incompatible with design exploration, which requires quick iteration. This research introduces a novel method for performance-driven geometry generation that can afford interaction directly in the 3d modeling environment, eliminating the need for explicit parametrization, and is multiple orders faster than the equivalent form optimization. The method uses Machine Learning techniques to train a generative model offline. The generative model learns a distribution of optimal performing geometries and their simulation contexts based on a dataset that addresses the performance(s) of interest. By navigating the generative model's latent space, geometries with the desired characteristics can be quickly generated. A case study is presented, demonstrating the generation of a synthetic dataset and the use of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) as a generative model for geometries with optimal solar gain. The results show that the VAE-generated geometries perform on average at least as well as the optimized ones, suggesting that the introduced method shows a feasible path towards more intuitive and interactive early-phase performance-driven design assistance.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-1280-1_6,WOS,Conference Paper

Even though several decision-making models have been proposed in cognitive science, their application to assisted teleoperation and assisted robotics has hardly been explored yet. Experimental data supports the Drift-Diffusion model as a suitable scheduling strategy for haptic shared control, in which the assistance mechanism can be adapted via the parameters of reward functions. Guidelines to tune the decision making model are presented. The influence of the reward structure on the realized haptic assistances is evaluated in a user study and results are compared to the no assistance and human assistance case.",2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TOH.2016.2581807,WOS,Journal

A revolution is underway and the commercial space industry is taking off. Less dependence on government business means that aerospace companies can attract new customers to emerging space markets. This dynamic global context promises of opening the new frontier to exploration and development in ways not anticipated by the established industry. Investments from venture capitalists along with new approaches to raise capital-such as crowdsourcing-are providing opportunities for small entrepreneurial space companies to gain a foothold in the sector. Between 2005 and 2012, investments were estimated at around 12 billion USD and this support is expected to continue as the new industry develops. This paper presents the results of an International Space University team project focused on helping new companies get started and take advantage of the new opportunities. The first of two outputs of this project is â€œThe Galactic Guide to Space Entrepreneurshipâ€, a handbook designed to be an easy-to-read guide for current and future space entrepreneurs-also referred to as astropreneurs. Alongside the handbook, we developed astropreneurs.space. This dynamic web resource features relevant and up-to-date content that will provide astropreneurs with the tools and insights needed to build and manage a successful space business. This article summarizes the creative process and the major findings of the team project including: a review of the market opportunities; the basics required knowledge in the areas of finance, business modelling, and the minimum viable product process; suggestions for effective branding; and the different stages of the fundraising journey. We also study the relevant legal aspects-for incorporating and running a space enterprise-and the currently available government sponsorships, university and incubation programs.

This paper takes Haier as a Chinese example and explores how manufacturing enterprises create and develop the sustainable e-commerce platform. The research findings show that: (1) An e-commerce platform respectively carries the functions of sales channels, service differences and innovation incubation in different stages of the manufacturing enterprises' sustainable development; (2) For managing e-commerce platform of manufacturing enterprises' sustainable development, resource orchestration can effectively realize the integration of value creation and resource; (3) Finally, it further reveals that the driving power which resource orchestration continuously promotes for the sustainable e-commerce platforms to construct is from the co-creation value of manufacturers and users. This paper discusses the structure of e-commerce platforms based on the main characteristics of each resource, and systematically explores the mechanism and evolutionary driving force of resource orchestration to promote the construction of e-commerce platforms for the sustainable development. It complements and enriches the innovation ecosystem and resource orchestration theory, providing significant practical guidance to the sustainable development of manufacturing enterprises.

The effects of this disease are much more profound in third world countries, which have very limited medical resources. When an intense outbreak occurs, most of these countries cannot cope with the high number of patients due to the lack of medicine, equipment and hospital facilities. The prevention or reduction of the risk factor of this disease is very challenging, especially in third world countries, due to poverty and economic insatiability. Technology can offer alternative solutions by providing early detection mechanisms that help to control the spread of the disease and allow the management of treatment facilities in advance to ensure a more timely health service, which can save thousands of lives. In this study, we have deployed an intelligent malaria outbreak early warning system, which is a mobile application that predicts malaria outbreak based on climatic factors using machine learning algorithms. The system will help hospitals, healthcare providers, and health organizations take precautions in time and utilize their resources in case of emergency. To our best knowledge, the system developed in this paper is the first publicly available application. Since confounding effects of climatic factors have a greater influence on the incidence of malaria, we have also conducted extensive research on exploring a new ecosystem model for the assessment of hidden ecological factors and identified three confounding factors that significantly influence the malaria incidence. Additionally, we deploy a smart healthcare application; this paper also makes a significant contribution by identifying hidden ecological factors of malaria.

FROM COMMUNITY-DRIVEN TO SERVICE-PURPOSED COWORKING SPACES,EUROPEAN SPATIAL RESEARCH AND POLICY,,10.18778/1231-1952.28.2.15,"Coworking spaces emerged in the mid-2000s as collaborative workplaces that actively supported teleworkers and self-employed knowledge workers who shared various (work) environments to interlace themselves in supportive networks, tackle isolation, positively influence well-being, and collaboratively participate in knowledge-sharing activities. However, with the swift popularisation of the coworking model by 2020, newly established flexible office spaces have begun to refer to themselves as community-based workplaces even though they lacked the capacity to support their users' interactions and collaborative work. Therefore, the purpose of the paper is to explore how coworking spaces have transformed from community-based environments to a flexible place of work where establishing a collaborative community is not an organisational priority. The following exploratory research investigates a sample of 13 coworking spaces in Prague, the Czech Republic, and considers their capacity for supporting interactions and collaborative processes between their users. The results uncovered significant differences between coworking spaces, their spatial designs, the presence of mediation mechanisms, and the frequency of interactions between users, and suggest that the handful of sampled coworking environments misuse the notion of community. In that context, the following study indicates that contemporary coworking spaces can revert to community washing to deliberately pursue economic self-interest rather than support decentralised peer-to-peer exchange that would lead to developing a coworking community.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.18778/1231-1952.28.2.15,WOS,Journal

In order to achieve high performance and low cost, these products require manufacturability and supply chain knowledge to be integrated earlier than usual in the design process. Knowledge-Based Engineering (KBE) applications can potentially fulfil this need by providing a digital Product Model that informs designers about manufacturability aspects and expected performance. This paper explores the currently available digital tools, as well as KBE and its applicability in facade design. It is first demonstrated that there is a fundamental gap in state-of-the-art digital tools: rather than integrating design principles and manufacturing constraints, existing and emerging tools continue to focus on single disciplines with no consideration for the actual manufacturing stage. The applicability of KBE is then evaluated by reviewing the current use of this approach in the building and other industries, namely, aerospace and shipbuilding. It is found that, although KBE is rarely used in facade design, there are significant opportunities for it to be applied in this sector, due to the similarity in terms of design tasks and priorities with the two other industries reviewed in this paper.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17452007.2017.1364216,WOS,Journal

Literature is emerging about how private industry can engage in the SDG framework. We aim to contribute to the sustainability and cross-sector partnership literatures by examining the motivations of organizations that partner into SDG platforms.

Our findings are based on semi-structured interviews and documents, and they focus on four Danish SDG platforms: UNLEASH, Hello Science, Fra Filantropi til Forretning (From Philanthropy to Business), and the SDG Accelerator. The findings suggest that speed, impact, and scaling of SDG innovations are features of SDG platforms that motivate cross-sector, boundary-spanning collaboration.

This study aims a) to identify business group's characteristics that make it an institute capable of coordinating innovation-driven development during the shift to a new technological paradigm, b) to analyse innovation-driven development within business groups in situation of instability caused by the structural transformations. The study uses business group-level reports and strategies to explore the role of administrative power, planning and structural factors in determining innovation outcomes of business groups in terms of technological and economic changes. We exploit a two-sector model imply that there is sector with surplus resources (basic sector financing innovation) and sector with scarce resources (pioneer sector providing innovation) in business group. While modelling the processes of innovation-driven development in the situation of economic instability, we reached the conclusion that institutions determine the direction and the level of business groups' impact on innovations growth in a time of structural transformations.

Design/methodology/approach The authors analyzed emotional contagion on innovative behavior and investigated the mediation effect of work engagement and surface acting, and used structural equation modeling to test the hypotheses. Subjects in this study comprised 263 dyads of supervisors and employees (131 supervisors and 263 employees) in the marketing department at China Mobile. Findings The results indicated that positive emotions by employees mediated the positive effect of supervisors' expression of positive emotions about employees' work engagement; work engagement mediated the positive effect of employees' positive emotions on their innovative behavior; and employees' negative emotions mediated and did not significantly mediate the effect of supervisors' negative emotions on employees' surface acting and innovative behavior, respectively. Research limitations/implications - This study recommends that future studies examine emotional labor by team members and investigate the types of mechanisms (such as psychological safety and team learning) adopted by such teams to increase their members' levels of emotional contagion.

(2020),Causal analysis of competing atomistic mechanisms in ferroelectric materials from high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy data,npj Computational Materials,,10.1038/s41524-020-00396-2,"Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for the analysis of mesoscopic and atomically resolved images and spectroscopy in electron and scanning probe microscopy, with the applications ranging from feature extraction to information compression and elucidation of relevant order parameters to inversion of imaging data to reconstruct structural models. However, the fundamental limitation of machine learning methods is their correlative nature, leading to extreme susceptibility to confounding factors. Here, we implement the workflow for causal analysis of structural scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) data and explore the interplay between physical and chemical effects in a ferroelectric perovskite across the ferroelectricâ€“antiferroelectric phase transitions. The combinatorial library of the Sm-doped BiFeO3 is grown to cover the composition range from pure ferroelectric BFO to orthorhombic 20% Sm-doped BFO. Atomically resolved STEM images are acquired for selected compositions and are used to create a set of local compositional, structural, and polarization field descriptors. The information-geometric causal inference (IGCI) and additive noise model (ANM) analysis are used to establish the pairwise causal directions between the descriptors, ordering the data set in the causal direction. The causal chain for IGCI and ANM across the composition is compared and suggests the presence of common causal mechanisms across the composition series. Ultimately, we believe that the causal analysis of the multimodal data will allow exploring the causal links between multiple competing mechanisms that control the emergence of unique functionalities of morphotropic materials and ferroelectric relaxors.

In particular, there is a need for a better understanding of the mechanisms through which relatedness is developed and how policy affects existing and emerging relatedness. Certain mechanisms for knowledge transfer have been suggested, such as labour mobility, firm diversification, spin-offs and social networks. But do the same mechanisms apply to all industries and in all territories, or are there specific mechanisms of knowledge sourcing at work in different contexts? To shed light on these questions, the article reports on a comparative case study of two knowledge-intensive industries (life science and publishing) located in the Oslo metropolitan region.

At the same time, the impact of technological innovation on enterprise employment may lead to some new changes under the environmental regulation constraints. However, existing studies have not included environmental regulation into the theoretical framework of technological innovation and enterprise employment, nor has the influencing mechanism of environmental regulation and technological innovation in the employment of manufacturing enterprises been explored. This paper uses the panel data of listed manufacturing companies in the A-share market of Shanghai and Shenzhen from 2011 to 2017 to examine the impact of environmental regulation and technological innovation on the employment of manufacturing enterprises, and explore their influence mechanisms in a theoretical framework based the moderating effect model. The findings demonstrate the following: First, the technological innovation has a positive creative effect on enterprise employment. Second, the impact of environmental regulation on enterprise employment is significantly positive. Third, environmental regulation has a negative moderating effect on the impact of technological innovation on enterprise employment. Finally, the impacts of both environmental regulation and technological innovation on the employment of manufacturing enterprises are heterogeneous across enterprises due to differences in ownership structure, the degree of pollution, and technical density. Therefore, faced with the objective reality that environmental carrying capacity has reached or approached the upper limit, China needs to formulate a differentiated and diversified technological innovation system and environmental protection policy, improve the environmental innovation level of manufacturing enterprises, and form a green development model, which is of great significance for achieving high-quality development and stable employment.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11102982,WOS,Journal

Political and professional guidance reaffirms compassion as an enduring philosophy of contemporary nursing practice, but provides limited insight into what compassion involves. To address this knowledge gap, a constructivist grounded theory study was undertaken with eleven participants who had experienced nursing care as patients across a range of contexts, exploring what they perceived compassion to involve. Theoretical sampling supported data collection via eleven interviews, a focus group discussion and three additional interviews. Data was analysed with initial coding, focused coding and conceptual mapping. Key findings highlighted the importance of cultivating compassion, which involved learning about compassion, role modelling for compassion, leadership for compassion, resources for compassion and systems and processes for compassion. These findings contribute to the ongoing professional dialogue surrounding compassion, specifically in relation to recruitment and selection, nurse education curricula, supervision of student nurses, compassionate organisational cultures, staffing levels and the systems and processes that underpin contemporary ways of working.

However, the development and/or adoption of ICT-focused water innovations in developing countries does not seem to occur at the expected pace, which calls for suitable innovation approaches. This chapter investigates how these innovations can be fostered through partnerships. The explorative analysis of 24 ICT-focused water innovation partnerships (ICT-WIPs) implemented in Africa leads to two important findings. First, it appears that these partnerships enable effective exchange of complementary tangible and intangible resources and co-creation of ICT-focused water solutions in a cost-effective and timely manner but also pose collaboration challenges due to the heterogeneity of innovation partners. Second, the analysis demonstrates the importance of concurrent use of relational (trust-based) and structural (legally binding control-based) partnership governance mechanisms to mitigate these challenges, notably by reducing opportunistic behaviours and increasing clarity of partnersâ€™ commitments and rights. We conclude that well-designed and -implemented ICT-WIPs can contribute to enhancing the capabilities of developing countries to implement the smart water systems agenda.

Recently, emerging machine learning techniques have had a promising impact on turbulence modeling, but are still in their infancy regarding widespread industrial adoption. Toward their extensive uptake, this paper presents a universally interpretable machine learning (UIML) framework for turbulence modeling, which consists of two parallel machine learning-based modules to directly infer the structural and parametric representations of turbulence physics, respectively. At each phase of model development, data reflecting the evolution dynamics of turbulence and domain knowledge representing prior physical considerations are converted into modeling knowledge. The data- and knowledge-driven UIML is investigated with a deep residual network. The following three aspects are demonstrated in detail: (i) a compact input feature parameterizing a new turbulent timescale is introduced to prevent nonunique mappings between conventional input arguments and output Reynolds stress; (ii) a realizability limiter is developed to overcome the under-constrained state of modeled stress; and (iii) fairness and noise-insensitivity constraints are included in the training procedure. Consequently, an invariant, realizable, unbiased, and robust data-driven turbulence model is achieved. The influences of the training dataset size, activation function, and network hyperparameter on the performance are also investigated. The resulting model exhibits good generalization across two- and three-dimensional flows, and captures the effects of the Reynolds number and aspect ratio. Finally, the underlying rationale behind prediction is explored.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/5.0048909,WOS,Journal

Here, we discuss one new application of those properties: the development of a novel bending technique using high temperature, and we explore its implications for design. We have explored the fundamental properties of laminated bamboo and its thermal relaxation as it passes the glass transition temperatures of its constituent polymers. By mechanically thinning engineered bamboo material, score lines allow precise, controlled and localised heating that promotes limited but essential elasto-plastic behaviour. Concentrated heating above the glass transition temperature induces property evolution and structural morphology changes, which results in thermal relaxation with minimal recovery and full set upon cooling. This original technology is then deployed in the design and construction of a folded plate helical shell composed of thin laminated bamboo sheets. (C) 2017 The Authors.

As a remedy, this paper proposes a resource-constrained innovation method (RCIM) to generate ideas for the NPD. The RCM is mainly divided into four sections: Developing the resource-constrained innovation approaches, developing the resource-constrained innovation dimensions, generating the creative ideas and evaluating the creative ideas. First, the resource-constrained innovation algorithms are developed based on success factors, characteristics, and attributes of resource-constrained innovation and the TRIZ (Teo 3aqa-iin Russian; Theory of Inventive Problem Solving in English) inventive principles via the systematic literature review (SLR). Second, the innovation dimensions are categorized to structure a target technology by means of the morphological analysis (MA) and the Derwent manual codes (DMCs) mapping based on collected patents. Third, the creative ideas are generated for the NPD by combining the innovation dimensions with the resource-constrained innovation approaches. Finally, the creative ideas are evaluated by the frugal criteria.

Conventional DST models are usually trained offline, which requires a fixed dataset prepared in advance. This paradigm is often impractical in real-world applications since online dialogue systems usually involve continually emerging new data and domains. Therefore, this paper explores Domain-Lifelong Learning for Dialogue State Tracking (DLL-DST), which aims to continually train a DST model on new data to learn incessantly emerging new domains while avoiding catastrophically forgetting old learned domains. To this end, we propose a novel domain-lifelong learning method, called Knowledge Preservation Networks (KPN), which consists of multi-prototype enhanced retrospection and multi-strategy knowledge distillation, to solve the problems of expression diversity and combinatorial explosion in the DLL-DST task. Experimental results show that KPN effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting and outperforms previous state-of-the-art lifelong learning methods by 4.25% and 8.27% of whole joint goal accuracy on the MultiWOZ benchmark and the SGD benchmark, respectively.

In addition, in the current era of open innovation, the demand for innovative behaviors by enterprises is increasing day by day. Therefore, this study intended to link the two to explore the relationship between them. Based on self-evaluation theory and face theory, taking enterprise employees as the research object, this paper discusses the impact of perceived overqualifications on employees' innovative behavior and the internal mechanism and examines the first-order and high-order moderating effects of ability-face pressure and length of service in turn. The results showed that perceived overqualifications had a positive impact on employees' innovation behavior, and felt trust had a mediating role in the relationship. Ability face pressure played a negative moderating role in the impact of felt trust on innovative behavior and played a negative moderating role in the impact of perceived overqualifications on innovative behavior. With the increase in the length of service, the negative moderating effect of ability face pressure on the relationship between perceived overqualifications and employees' innovative behavior weakened. It is expected that these results will enable companies to understand the internal mechanisms of employee perceived overqualification, enlighten leaders to give more trust to employees, help companies to improve employees' innovative behavior, and pay attention to the psychological factors of employees, which will help to create a sustainable work environment and promote sustainable business development.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14063493,WOS,Journal

From the analysis of the body of literature on the topic, exploration and exploitation emerge as critical processes in the development of entrepreneurial universities. Nevertheless, the way they are balanced within universities is an under-researched topic. Adapted from the concept of organisational ambidexterity, this paper develops the notion of university ambidexterity to analyse the development process of entrepreneurial universities. To achieve this research aim, a conceptual model is developed by integrating the learning processes of exploration and exploitation to the previous theories used to analyse the entrepreneurial university. As already emphasised in other studies focusing on the role of ambidexterity in different research contexts, this paper proposes an idea of balance over time. The universities need to balance exploration and exploitation in their evolutionary path towards the entrepreneurial model, but it may be not necessary to invest in exploration and exploitation processes simultaneously. On the contrary, it may be most important to oscillate between periods of exploration and periods of exploitation to achieve ambidexterity over time. As a result, the tensions between exploration and exploitation processes generate a twisting learning path for entrepreneurial universities. Finally, the paper proposes an integrated conceptual framework which consists of six constructs, namely internal organisational environment, external environment, university exploration, university exploitation, university ambidexterity, entrepreneurial university performance. The proposed research hypotheses on the interrelationships between the mentioned constructs and the mediating role of university ambidexterity constitute potential areas of investigation to direct future empirical research and further develop the body of knowledge in the field of entrepreneurial universities.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2018.10.014,WOS,Journal

(2018),Business model design and firm performance Evidence of interactive effects from a developing economy,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT,,10.1108/EJIM-02-2017-0012,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the literature on business model (BM) design by deepening the relationship between BM design themes and performance in a sample of firms based in a developing country. In particular, the authors deepen the relationship between business model novelty (BMN), business model efficiency (BME), the trade-off between novelty and efficiency - that the authors call BM ambidexterity - and performance. Design/methodology/approach - Data are drawn from a sample of 107 manufacturing and service firms based in a developing country (Albania). Hierarchical regression is used to assess the impact on firm performance from the two BM design themes and their interaction. Findings - The authors find novelty-centred BM design is significantly related to firm performance while efficiency-centred design has no direct effect on performance. However, the authors also find that BME positively moderates the relationship between BMN and firm performance. Research limitations/implications - The relationship between BM design and firm performance can be better understood if contextualised. In the paper, the authors find that different types of BM designs have different impacts on the performance of firms based in a developing economy. While novelty matters, quite surprisingly the authors find no support for efficiency. Additionally, the authors find the interaction between the two design themes (BM ambidexterity) to have a positive impact on firm performance. Practical implications - The surveyed firms based in a developing economy appear to benefit from novelty-centred BM designs. Efficiency-centred designs have a more ambiguous role: while efficiency alone seems not to pay off, an efficient BM design may facilitate the market exploitation of a novel design. Originality/value - This study responds to a precise call for additional quantitative empirical studies on the relationship between BM and performance. The study also contributes to an emerging stream of research focused on BM ambidexterity.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EJIM-02-2017-0012,WOS,Journal

The results reveal that market competition, resource allocation towards internal and external R&D, good quality mobile network coverage and the use of external certified financial auditors have all positive and significant effects on the propensity to learn management practices. The results also suggest that private intellectual property rights protection in the context of inefficient legal systems can deter firms from learning, perhaps in fear of legal ramifications.

The proposed model is empirically tested using data from 1988 company executives across a wide range of organizations globally. A research model and the related hypotheses are tested using structural equation modelling. The study found that organizational level IT innovation readiness conceptualized through technology readiness and internal expertise is a key mediator for successful organizational level technology adoption. Other organizational factors such as top management support, organizational structure, and organization culture, were positively related to the overall level of IT innovation readiness and organizational level technology adoption. Considering that there are many organizational factors that influence the adoption of technology, future research should extend the research framework and include additional variables that could support IT innovation adoption outcomes. The study makes a significant contribution to the existing literature by providing empirical evidence related to the organizational factors necessary for a successful IT innovation adoption at an organizational level.

The need for empirical knowledge arises because any reasonably complete exploration of the potential energy surfaces (PES) of organic reactions is computationally prohibitive. We have previously introduced the heuristically-aided quantum chemistry (HAQC) approach to modeling complex chemical reactions, which abstracts the empirical knowledge in terms of chemical heuristics simple rules guiding the PES exploration and combines them with structure optimizations using quantum chemical methods. The HAQC approach makes use of heuristic kinetic criteria for selecting reaction paths that are not only plausible, that is, consistent with the empirical rules of organic reactivity, but also feasible under the reaction conditions. In this work, we develop heuristic kinetic feasibility criteria, which correctly predict feasible reaction pathways for a wide range of simple polar (substitutions, additions, and eliminations) and pericyclic organic reactions (cyclizations, sigmatropic shifts, and cycloadditions). In contrast to knowledge-based reaction mechanism prediction methods, the same kinetic heuristics are successful in classifying reaction pathways as feasible or infeasible across this diverse set of reaction mechanisms.

By reviewing related literature, some notable limitations and inconsistent results are highlighted in extant studies. To address these challenges, this study aims to explore the effects of strategic orientation and KM mechanisms on business performance. Design/methodology/approach The study conducted an empirical investigation of 227 small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to explore the relationship between strategy-performance and KM-performance. Business strategy is conceptualized as a comparative construct with six dimensions, KM is conceptualized by two types of KM mechanisms of technical and non-technical KM mechanisms and business performance is measured by four dimensions of balanced scorecard (BSC). The cluster analysis was used to explore different aspects of these three constructs. Findings Using cluster analysis, the results indicate that firms with high level of analysis, defensiveness, futurity and proactiveness in strategic orientation have better performance and also the high level of both KM mechanisms another important finding shows that firms with more KM mechanisms have high performance and technical mechanisms have more predictor role on performance. Practical implications - This research also has prescriptive implications for strategic managers and KM practitioners. The finding enhanced the understanding of the relationship between strategic orientations, KM and performance. The results assist managers to assess business performance regarding strategic orientations and KM mechanisms of the firms. Therefore, it helps firms to improve strategic resource allocation and exploit KM investment by considering ideal pattern of the performance. Originality/value By reviewing strategic management and KM literature, it is revealed that there are little studies about how the interaction of strategic orientation and KM influences business performance. The main contribution of the study is exploring the profile of the firms by considering their strategic orientation and KM mechanisms and their impact on business performance.

We derive a model and propositions to show how variations in trust and innovation-related collaboration with specific external actors relate to formal and informal appropriability mechanisms. The results show that while trust was strongly associated with open service firms collaborating with other firms, and specifically supply chain partners, in the absence of trust firms pursued a closed approach to innovation or relied on contracts to govern inter-organisational collaborations and appropriability. Formal contracts also underpinned all firm-university interactions to structure and coordinate research and development collaborations and delineate the basis for appropriation of intellectual property (IP) outcomes. Formal Intellectual Property Rights were predominately utilised by firms to capture value from their innovative activities with universities. In contrast, firms negotiated informally IP arrangements with supply chain partners, usually based on shared IP. Thus, a further pattern in the data was that firms' approaches to IP protection and appropriability were contingent on the actor the focal firm was collaborating with.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10961-018-9696-y,WOS,Journal

In the near future, the middle class will see a large-scale growth in numbers, and this group is self-evident for the development and progress of our media. With the development of the times, the role of the media will also change dramatically. For example, the focus of the media will be to play the role of urban information service providers. With the development of new technologies, the development of the media will be increasingly affected. The era of smart media is coming soon, which is closely related to the development and application of 5G technology. Advertising education is the development orientation of advertising forms. Only in this way can it meet the needs of the new media era and explore the path of reform and innovation. After expounding the advantages of the attention mechanism in processing EEG data under low-cost devices and its own solutions to the problem of insufficient memory, this article separates the output values and hidden layer state values of the long-term memory network and the short-term memory network Introducing into the designed attention module can not only maximize the output value and hidden layer state value of the long-term memory network and short-term memory network. Aiming at the short-term memory and long-term memory of the network, it has also achieved better results and obtained more accurate data classification results.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11276-021-02700-4,WOS,Journal

(2021),PsychRNN: An Accessible and Flexible Python Package for Training Recurrent Neural Network Models on Cognitive Tasks,ENEURO,,10.1523/ENEURO.0427-20.2020,"Example workflow for using PsychRNN. First, the task of interest is defined, and a recurrent neural network (RNN) model is trained to perform the task, optionally with neurobiologically informed constraints on the network. After the network is trained, the researchers can investigate network properties including the synaptic connectivity patterns and the dynamics of neural population activity during task execution, and other studies, e.g., those on perturbations, can be explored. The dotted line shows the possible repetition of this cycle with one network, which allows investigation of training effects of task shaping, or curriculum learning, for closed-loop training of the network on a progression of tasks. Task-trained artificial recurrent neural networks (RNNs) provide a computational modeling framework of increasing interest and application in computational, systems, and cognitive neuroscience. RNNs can be trained, using deep-learning methods, to perform cognitive tasks used in animal and human experiments and can be studied to investigate potential neural representations and circuit mechanisms underlying cognitive computations and behavior. Widespread application of these approaches within neuroscience has been limited by technical barriers in use of deep-learning software packages to train network models. Here, we introduce PsychRNN, an accessible, flexible, and extensible Python package for training RNNs on cognitive tasks. Our package is designed for accessibility, for researchers to define tasks and train RNN models using only Python and NumPy, without requiring knowledge of deep-learning software. The training backend is based on TensorFlow and is readily extensible for researchers with Tensor Flow knowledge to develop projects with additional customization. PsychRNN implements a number of specialized features to support applications in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Users can impose neurobiologically relevant constraints on synaptic connectivity patterns. Furthermore, specification of cognitive tasks has a modular structure, which facilitates parametric variation of task demands to examine their impact on model solutions. PsychRNN also enables task shaping during training, or curriculum learning, in which tasks are adjusted in closed-loop based on performance. Shaping is ubiquitous in training of animals in cognitive tasks, and PsychRNN allows investigation of how shaping trajectories impact learning and model solutions. Overall, the PsychRNN framework facilitates application of trained RNNs in neuroscience research.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0427-20.2020,WOS,Journal

(2021),Framing and assessing the emergent field of business model innovation for the circular economy: A combined literature review and multiple case study approach,SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION,,10.1016/j.spc.2020.12.037,"Widespread adoption of sustainable and circular business models is required to accelerate the transition to a more sustainable society, however, the literature supporting the process of Business Model Innovation for the Circular Economy -or Circular Business Model Innovation (CBMI) -is currently emerging. Several publications on this field have been published since 2014, nevertheless, there is still a lack of understanding on the process of CBMI, particularly for incumbent firms; and, as most of the literature is theoretical, further empirical insights are required. Furthermore, there is a need for an updated and comprehensive review of this fast-paced field, and a need to further integrate the CBMI field with the conventional Business Model Innovation (BMI) domain. The present research aims to first, map and frame the field of CBMI, building upon the structure of the conventional BMI field; second, to assess the current state of research of the field, proposing a future research agenda; and third, to explore the most relevant elements of the CBMI process in the practice. The article uses a combined literature and multiple case study approach. It begins by synthesizing a BMI framework, which is then combined with the findings of a systematic literature review (n = 84) on the emergent CBMI field, to propose an original framework that structures the field. The review includes an assessment per article on the state-of-research. The framework is then illustrated through a multiple case study on ten incumbent firms that have implemented a substantial CBMI, revealing which topics are more relevant from a practice perspective and offering valuable empirical insights. We suggest that future research should prioritize those topics that are very important from the practice and still un-or under-researched in the CBMI field (i.e. organizational culture and structure as moderators of the CBMI change process, sustainability strategy as an antecedent of CBMI and top management role as key elements of the CBMI process) and to those identified as important though under-researched (i.e. organizational change management as a key element of the CBMI process; organizational inertia, ambidexterity and CBMI uncertainties as moderators of the CBMI process; and systemic change as an effect of the CBMI). The literature on Sustainable BMI is integrated to propose contributions to the identified gaps. This research contributes by framing and assessing the field of CBMI, proposing a future research agenda, providing a detailed literature state-of-research assessment and by further integrating CBMI with the conventional BMI field.

However, its actual conceptual treatment in academic research is not necessarily clear or precise. Most research considers digital innovation as the final result of adopting digital technologies, such as new products, processes, services, or business models. In other words, this research advances the concept of digital innovation as an outcome. In parallel to this research on digital innovation as an outcome, the concept of digital innovation as a process has emerged, linking innovation capabilities, organizational structures, boundaries, and technology management in organisations. The scattered existing research on digital innovation as a process explores the anatomy of the digital transformation of the innovation process by focusing on its phases, underlying mechanisms, barriers, and enabling factors. We argue that management research should pay more attention to this perspective on digital innovation. Therefore, in this essay, we take stock of research on the topic and identify four orchestration mechanisms that are inherently processual, enabling the firm to effectively coordinate and leverage different types of resources to create and capture value through the adoption and exploitation of digital technologies in the innovation process. Based on these orchestration mechanisms, we develop an agenda for future research that will hopefully inform further scholarly inquiry in the field of digital innovation.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14479338.2021.1963736,WOS,Journal

Examining the Black Box through MASEM,JOURNAL OF PRODUCT INNOVATION MANAGEMENT,,10.1111/jpim.12335,"Understanding how firms can promote exploratory and exploitative innovations is of high interest for both scholars and practitioners. Although a substantial body of research has emphasized that top management's transformational leadership is crucial to innovation, the mechanisms through which strategic leaders influence these distinct types of innovations remain unclear. Building on upper echelon and social learning theory, this study develops and empirically examines a model that investigates the mediating roles of three distinct strategic orientations (market, learning, and entrepreneurial orientation) on the relationship between transformational leadership and exploratory and exploitative innovation. Using meta-analytic methods combined with structural equation modeling, this study integrates findings from separate research streams, covering over 15 years of research, and using a sample of 215 effect sizes from 75 studies. The results from the partial mediation model reveal that transformational leaders play a key role in creating these specific strategic orientations which, in turn, support different innovation outcomes. Specifically, the findings indicate that transformational leaders promote exploitative innovations predominantly by building a market orientation, whereas they foster exploratory innovations by stimulating an entrepreneurial and a learning orientation. Hence, this study extends upper echelon research by uncovering the different mechanisms through which transformational leaders promote exploratory and exploitative innovations as it theoretically identifies and empirically validates the unique mediating roles of three specific strategic orientations. The results thus provide valuable insights for the challenging management of exploratory and exploitative innovations, as they provide a guiding map which reveals how transformational leaders from the top may use specific orientations to foster these distinct types of innovations.",2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpim.12335,WOS,Journal

Nevertheless, critiques of several persistent routines in public engagement continue to resurface, in particular the focus on expert knowledge, cognitive exchange, risk discourse, and understandings of public opinion as being static. In an attempt to break out of these routines, we experimented with an innovative engagement format that employs situated speculative prototyping to support citizens in contextualizing and discussing developments regarding-in this case-nanotechnology. This format invites participants to imagine and critically reflect on technological futures through collaborative prototyping and story-writing. In this paper, we outline five reconstructed contextualization patterns in which participants engaged during the format's exercises and use these to assess the value of the format in the current engagement landscape. We show that situated speculative prototyping has potential in the realm of informal public engagement initiatives, taking an explorative approach, but also warn of 'the designer fallacy' as a prominent pitfall of prototyping that could reproduce techno-scientific framings and obstruct critical reflection on technological directions and implications if not treated with caution.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11569-020-00382-4,WOS,Journal

It uses longitudinal single case analysis and a theoretical framework based on Teece's three dynamic capabilities. Findings Results show that dynamic capabilities can be conceived as stages in the process of social innovation. Sensing refers to the capability to identify a societal demand for social transformation. Seizing capability is about shaping societal demand into a commercial offer. Reconfiguring concerns organisational innovation to integrate actual and new knowledge through innovative routines. Microprocesses of both path dependency and path building are in action at each of the three stages.

The nonlinearities and uncertainties which are caused by dynamical device, mechanical structure, extreme downhole environment and requirements of complex trajectory design in the actual drilling work increase the difficulties of accurate trajectory tracking. This paper proposes a model-based dual-loop feedback cooperative control method based on interval type-2 fuzzy logic control (IT2FLC) and actor-critic reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms with one-order digital low-pass filters (LPF) for three-dimensional trajectory tracking of RSS. In the proposed RSS trajectory tracking control architecture, an IT2FLC is utilized to deal with system nonlinearities and uncertainties, and an online iterative actor-critic RL controller structured by radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN) and adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) is exploited to eliminate the stick-slip oscillations relying on its approximate properties both in action function (actor) and value function (critic). The two control effects are fused to constitute cooperative controller to realize accurate trajectory tracking of RSS. The effectiveness of our controller is validated by simulations on designed function tests for angle building hole rate and complete downhole trajectory tracking, and by comparisons with other control methods.

Empirical research in the workplace has been much less represented than in formal education. Even less research is available that aimed to identify which technological scaffolding interventions, out of those available in a learning environment, had the highest influence on specific micro-level process of self-regulated learning. This paper reports on the findings of a case study conducted in the naturalistic settings of two organizations in Europe (N = 53) for the period of two months. Trace data about the events of engagement with the technological scaffolding interventions and micro-level processes of self regulated learning were collected. Both a transition graph based analysis of the temporal dependencies of the collected events and multiple linear regression analyses showed that an intervention that promoted social awareness had consistently the highest effect on all the micro-level processes used in the study. This intervention was followed by the intervention that offered system-generated recommendations about learning paths, learning activities and knowledge assets to stimulate engagement into the micro-level processes within the forethought or preparatory phase of self-regulated learning. These findings suggest that both the social and organizational contexts should be taken into account when developing interventions aimed at supporting the forethought and engagement phases.

The purpose of this article is to provide a conceptual model of needed entrepreneurial competencies to effectively utilise novel technologies I4 has to offer. To develop the model, this exploratory study adopts an action research approach. Using predefined questions developed from previous literature, a representative sample was obtained from 17 in-depth interviews with entrepreneurs. From the data analyses, where machine learning technologies were used, it was found that to respond and navigate the layers of I4 technologies and enable new possibilities, entrepreneurs require certain competencies in this globally connected and technology-fuelled world. This article advances entrepreneurial research as it provides a platform to guide and support their development, which has been a key focus area both internationally and in South Africa, to address one of the key sustainable development goals, economic growth.

In this model, the influence of a firm's cultural typology on unlearning and innovation is conceptualized and hypotheses are developed. The model was tested empirically using a sample of 145 firms drawn from the Spanish automotive components manufacturing sector, and the relationships between the constructs were assessed using the partial least squares path-modeling approach.

Hence, the purpose of this work is to design a word recommendation system that can analyze a learner's previously learned words in order to suggest new vocabulary that can be acquired in a particular learning location. We designed a study and explored a dataset for uncovering the insight of language learners' learning behaviors. 20 EFL (English as Foreign Language) learners' data, whose learning location was Tokushima region of Japan, is analyzed by using association rule mining technique. The result indicates that-First, in informal learning context, EFL learners' word learning interests vary much from each other although the learning location is same; and Second, a word recommendation system can be introduced by using association rule mining analysis; however, the possibility of getting highly associated words are low compared with random words.

To cope with the increasing privacy leakages of machine learning while benefiting from unbalanced data distributions, federated learning has been wildly adopted as a novel intelligent edge computing framework with a localized training mechanism. However, recent studies found that the federated learning framework exhibits inherent vulnerabilities on active attacks, and poisoning attack is one of the most powerful and secluded attacks where the functionalities of the global model could be damaged through attacker's well-crafted local updates. In this article, we give a comprehensive exploration of the poisoning attack mechanisms in the context of federated learning. We first present a poison data generation method, named Data_Gen, based on the generative adversarial networks (GANs). This method mainly relies upon the iteratively updated global model parameters to regenerate samples of interested victims. Second, we further propose a novel generative poisoning attack model, named PoisonGAN, against the federated learning framework. This model utilizes the designed Data_Gen method to efficiently reduce the attack assumptions and make attacks feasible in practice. We finally evaluate our data generation and attack models by implementing two types of typical poisoning attack strategies, label flipping and backdoor, on a federated learning prototype. The experimental results demonstrate that these two attack models are effective in federated learning.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2020.3023126,WOS,Journal

In this sense, the adaptation of the traditional learning environments is a mandatory step to keep students highly motivated. Additionally, labour markets are demanding professionals with problem-solving capabilities, leadership skills, and adaptation capabilities for changing environments. This situation is boosting universities worldwide to update their traditional teaching methods and physical spaces. Makerspaces, also known as hackerspaces, hack labs, or fab labs, could become a bridge between universities and industry, particularly in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) careers, boosting the inclusion of autonomous and social learning. They are open-access spaces in which tools, machines, and knowledge are shared with the purpose of implementing an idea or project. Their increasing importance in higher education was anticipated by the New Media Consortium (NMC) Horizon Report of 2015 that estimated a deadline for their widespread adoption worldwide in less than three years. Design, modify, build, or just test are usual activities performed in these places. The idea behind makerspaces has grown one on one with the Do It Yourself (DIY) movement, an open-source philosophy that intends to democratize the technology making it accessible to everyone. From an academic point of view, makerspaces can help in developing competencies such as creativity or innovation. As information regarding the mechanical design, electronics, and software of an open-source machine (RepRap 3D printer, CNC-machine, Arduino-based robot, etc.) is publicly available, students can understand better the technical or mechanisms that define any open-source device. Consequently, hands-on activities as modifications, improvements and innovations can be implemented by the students, reinforcing their creativity and invention capacity. Aware of the importance of these relatively new learning environments, some of the most prestigious universities in the world have created makerspaces within their campuses. This communication evaluates the current status of the makerspaces at the world's top 10 universities in engineering and three of the most well-known Spanish ones. Information was mainly mined from university websites and informative e-mails. More specifically, the categories addressed were scope, accessibility, payment, equipment, and staff. Despite the lack of resources reported in some cases, we discovered exceptionally successful examples such as the 'Makers UPV' with a high number of promoting activities. Lastly, the implementation of a makerspace at the University of La Rioja (UR-Maker) is described including information about its organization, funding sources, and activities. Through their own experience in the UR-Maker, the authors demonstrate that the creation of new makerspaces requires a minimum financial and human effort. We hope that this communication will become a useful guideline for other universities with the intention of exploring the implementation of a makerspace within their campuses.",2018,,WOS,Conference Paper

Existing methods mainly explore cross-media correlation from either global-level instances as the whole images and sentences, or local-level fine-grained patches as the discriminative image regions and key words, which ignore the complementary information from the relation between local-level fine-grained patches. Naturally, relation understanding is highly important for learning cross-media correlation. People focus on not only the alignment between discriminative image regions and key words, but also their relations lying in the visual and textual context. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Multi-level Adaptive Visual-textual Alignment (MAVA) approach with the following contributions. First, we propose cross-media multi-pathway fine-grained network to extract not only the local fine-grained patches as discriminative image regions and key words, but also visual relations between image regions as well as textual relations from the context of sentences, which contain complementary information to exploit fine-grained characteristics within different media types. Second, we propose visual-textual bi-attention mechanism to distinguish the fine-grained information with different saliency from both local and relation levels, which can provide more discriminative hints for correlation learning. Third, we propose cross-media multi-level adaptive alignment to explore global, local and relation alignments. An adaptive alignment strategy is further proposed to enhance the matched pairs of different media types, and discard those misalignments adaptively to learn more precise cross-media correlation. Extensive experiments are conducted to perform image-sentence matching on 2 widely-used cross-media datasets, namely Flickr-30K and MS-COCO, comparing with 10 state-of-the-art methods, which can fully verify the effectiveness of our proposed MAVA approach.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2019.2952085,WOS,Journal

However, these relationships have been explored solely using bivariate statistical analysis and thus require more intermediate factors to emphasize the need for monitoring and controlling human error by improving the workplace environment. Moreover, prevalent studies rely heavily on expert experience, which is subjective and creates potential estimation noise. In this study, the mechanism whereby environmental factors influence behavior and its associate factors is learned with an algorithm using a Bayesian network structure. Rather than being simply data-driven, the algorithm initiates learning from prior knowledge, the theoretical causal chain in the cognitive reliability and error analysis method (CREAM), and revises the learning approach against safety inspection data if necessary. The learned Bayesian network shows that human error and incorrect sequencing result from a combination of limited cognitive functions and improper spatial/workmanship arrangements caused by equipment defects, improper design, and management problems.

While computational techniques are emerging to address aspects of these concerns through communities such as discrimination-aware data mining (DADM) and fairness, accountability and transparency machine learning (FATML), their practical implementation faces real-world challenges. For legal, institutional or commercial reasons, organisations might not hold the data on sensitive attributes such as gender, ethnicity, sexuality or disability needed to diagnose and mitigate emergent indirect discrimination-by-proxy, such as redlining. Such organisations might also lack the knowledge and capacity to identify and manage fairness issues that are emergent properties of complex sociotechnical systems. This paper presents and discusses three potential approaches to deal with such knowledge and information deficits in the context of fairer machine learning. Trusted third parties could selectively store data necessary for performing discrimination discovery and incorporating fairness constraints into model-building in a privacy-preserving manner. Collaborative online platforms would allow diverse organisations to record, share and access contextual and experiential knowledge to promote fairness in machine learning systems. Finally, unsupervised learning and pedagogically interpretable algorithms might allow fairness hypotheses to be built for further selective testing and exploration. Real-world fairness challenges in machine learning are not abstract, constrained optimisation problems, but are institutionally and contextually grounded. Computational fairness tools are useful, but must be researched and developed in and with the messy contexts that will shape their deployment, rather than just for imagined situations. Not doing so risks real, near-term algorithmic harm.",2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2053951717743530,WOS,Journal

However, these methods ignore the similarity of user characteristics, so the learned embedding representation fails to fully reflect user preferences. In this article, we propose a new model FSKGCN. By modeling the similarities between user characteristics, we design an architecture that integrates and knowledge propagation and user similar characteristics. Specifically, FSKGCN develops a user feature similarity modeling layer, which calculates the similarity between user features by introducing a multi-head attention mechanism, and further encodes the user's high-order features according to the similarity score. Compared with other KG-based methods, FSKGCN provides a new architecture that combines knowledge information with user similar characteristics. We conducted CTR experiments on two real-world datasets, and the results show that FSKGCN is significantly better than the latest benchmark method.

The service capability of local think tanks is affected by many factors, and the influence intensity of these factors on the service capability construction of local new-type think tanks with local characteristics is also changing, forming different driving forces for the service capability construction of new-type think tanks with local characteristics and forming a new service capability system for the innovation and development of local think tanks. This paper explores the changes in the relationship between the service capacity structure and elements of local think tanks brought about by the change of local party and governmentâ€™s decision-making consultation demand and local decision-making environment in the new era. With the new demand of user-oriented decision-making consultation, local think tanks need to establish new service capabilities that adapt to the new demand, accelerate the transformation of local think tanksâ€™ service capabilities on the basis of improving the guarantee mechanism and build new service capabilities under the environment of network and big data.

While European regions are different in many ways, the innovation capacity of regions, clusters and firms is what makes them capable of building up new and diversified pathways for sustainable growth. For this reason, Innovation Drivers and Regional Innovation Strategies looks to analyze different knowledge drivers (e.g. entrepreneurial or policy-orientation; scientific and practice-based knowledge modes; institutional innovation support) that influence the innovative and competitive capacity of regions, clusters and firms in Europe. The aim of this volume is to develop an in-depth understanding of these drivers and their implications for the way in which regional and cluster growth may be upgraded. Innovation Drivers and Regional Innovation Strategies examines the construction of new innovation pathways for regions and clusters in different geographical contexts. The main themes are cluster evolution, regional innovation systems and business innovation modes and capabilities. The objectives are centred on exploring the logic and mechanisms that can be activated as a means to promote innovation and competitiveness within regions and, within these, across and within firms. Aimed at researchers and academics in the field, this is a thoughtful and innovative new volume that helps define the academic debate. Â© 2016 Taylor & Francis.

The aim of this study is to understand how and why, in the service context, tensions and potential conflicts between heterogeneous interest groups unfold during processes of innovation. The empirical field in which the investigation was set is facility services, a type of business-to-business support services. The findings were extracted from a longitudinal, in-depth case study of a Danish, multi-national organisation over 13 years, complemented with an explorative study in the Danish facility service context. The findings suggest that tensions and conflicts between heterogeneous interest groups are an intrinsic element of innovation processes in services, and that emphasising them might actually support a clearer understanding of processes of innovation in services.

Studying the psychology of new entrepreneurs is conducive to understanding the relationship between human capital and economic growth. The work reported here aims to explore the impact of human capital on economic growth in Northeast China and the influencing factors of psychological capital of new entrepreneurs in the entrepreneurial process. Based on Cobb-Douglas production function, the relationship between labor, physical capital, or human capital and economic growth in Northeast China is analyzed by econometric methods, and a model of human capital and economic growth in Northeast China is constructed. Besides, a psychological capital intervention (PCI) model is proposed to develop the psychological capital of new entrepreneurs, and the psychological quality structure model of entrepreneurial entrepreneurs and its operation mechanism. The results of the empirical analysis demonstrate that the elasticity coefficient of human capital in Northeast China is 0.15902, five times smaller than that of labor and physical capital. Moreover, 70% of new ventures are willing to accept higher education. The fitting degree of using the PCI model to develop the psychological capital of new ventures is only 0.3%. In addition, the modified external environment PCI instead of the external environment PCI model has a huge operating potential in the macro-entrepreneurial environment. In conclusion, the impact of human capital on economic growth in the northeast is smaller than the impact of labor and material capital investment on regional economic growth. The development of human capital and research on the composition and mechanism of psychological quality of entrepreneurial entrepreneurs are of significant theoretical and practical values to promote the economic growth in the northeast.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.731284,WOS,Journal

This paper proposes a web page categorization method that categorizes web pages based on semantic features and contextual knowledge. Initially, the GloVe model is applied to capture the semantic features of the web pages. Thereafter, a Stacked Bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with symmetric structure is applied to extract the contextual and latent symmetry information from the semantic features for web page categorization.

This article focuses on the required patterns of learning in order to cope with these changes, and what automotive managers can learn from the aerospace industry in this context. As organizational learning is the central parameter of economic evolution, and technology develops over trajectory shifts, companies are, at the very least, cyclically forced to learn ambidextrously, or are squeezed out of the market. They have to act and react as complex adaptive systems in their changing environment. Especially in these dynamics, ambidextrous learning is identified to be a conditio sine qua non for organizational success. Especially the combination of efficiency-oriented internal exploitation with an explorative and external-oriented open innovation network turns out to be a superior strategy. By combining patent data, patent citation analysis and data on the European Framework Programs, we show that there are temporal differences, i.e., position of the product in the product, technique, technology, and industry life cycle. Furthermore, we draw a conclusion dependent on the systemic product character, which enforces different learning requirements concerning supply chain position and, as an overarching conclusion, we identify product structure to be decisive for how organizational learning should be styled.

However, policiesâ€™ successful implementation depends largely on the context where they are applied. Classic decision-making used to be based on a static plan that was considered optimal for the â€œmost likelyâ€ future contextual outcome. However, predicting the most probable evolution of this context has been proved unsuccessful, since it is vulnerable to unanticipated parameter change. Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways can address this problem focusing on the design of short-term policies, with simultaneous definition of adaptive interventions to be chosen on the long-term. This article presents a transdisciplinary modeling framework, which builds on the original Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways methodology. To demonstrate the applicability of this framework the authors used it to explore the evolution of the small-scale solar photovoltaics share in Greece, towards the achievement of the national capacity targets of 2025 and 2030. Model outcomes facilitated the identification of several pathways achieving the capacity targets, while reducing the risk for retroactive policy changes. Overall, the presented study demonstrates potential to support the design of adaptive policies over contextual evolutions so that social, economic and technological aspects of integrative planning are balanced towards the achievement of climate targets.

In particular, we examine three research questions that address: (i) the interrelationships among the three dimensions of buyer-supplier social capital (structural, cognitive, relational); (ii) the mechanism through which buyer-supplier social capital can influence supplier performance; and (iii) the contingency factors that influence the key relationships in the main model. We empirically validate the research model using data collected from a North America-based major electronic components distributor (i.e., the buyer) and 166 of its suppliers. The findings of our data analysis indicate that structural and cognitive social capital influence relational social capital. The findings also support that relational social capital allows for the transfer of knowledge from the buyer to the supplier, which in turn leads to greater supplier cost efficiency and innovation. However, the influence of buyer-supplier relational social capital appears to be less important in lengthier buyer-supplier relationships. The analysis also indicates that the benefits derived from a supplier's knowledge enrichment are significantly greater when the supplier possesses greater exploitative capacity.

The business opportunities are huge but developing product and service offerings and achieving competitive advantage means rethinking your business model from early creativity and design processes, through marketing and communication to pricing and supply. Designing for the Circular Economy highlights and explores â€˜state of the artâ€™ research and industrial practice, highlighting CE as a source of: new business opportunities; radical business change; disruptive innovation; social change; and new consumer attitudes. The thirty-four chapters provide a comprehensive overview of issues related to product circularity from policy through to design and development. Chapters are designed to be easy to digest and include numerous examples. An important feature of the book is the case studies section that covers a diverse range of topics related to CE, business models and design and development in sectors ranging from construction to retail, clothing, technology and manufacturing. Designing for the Circular Economy will inform and educate any companies seeking to move their business models towards these emerging models of sustainability; organizations already working in the circular economy can benchmark their current activities and draw inspiration from new applications and an understanding of the changing social and political context. This book will appeal to both academia and business with an interest in CE issues related to products, innovation and new business models.

Its recent breakthrough is mainly because of the rapid advances in hardware and image processing algorithms, especially machine learning. As an essential support of single-particle cryo-EM, machine learning has powered many aspects of structure determination and greatly promoted its development. In this article, we provide a systematic review of the applications of machine learning in this field. Our review begins with a brief introduction of single-particle cryo-EM, followed by the specific tasks and challenges of its image processing. Then, focusing on the workflow of structure determination, we describe relevant machine learning algorithms and applications at different steps, including particle picking, 2-D clustering, 3-D reconstruction, and other steps. As different tasks exhibit distinct characteristics, we introduce the evaluation metrics for each task and summarize their dynamics of technology development.

Principle decomposition symmetry this thesis studied can be further divided into heterogeneous principle decomposition symmetry and homogeneous principle decomposition symmetry. Based on principle decomposition symmetry's working mechanism and function, we can get a relationship system, for example, from product's performance requirements to the advantages and disadvantages of the products based on the principle decomposition, and then form the principle for design of principle decomposition. Symmetry exists widely in the natural or man-made products from articles for daily use to machinery products, especially in physics, the study of symmetry has got very rich achievements. The study of symmetry in the mechanical system is also very popular. In fact, the so-called mechanical symmetry must be symmetrical or repetitive as for the structure, principle and function in various mechanical systems. There are three elements in mechanical symmetry, the main body, component and benchmark. The mechanical system principle decomposition symmetry enhances the principle of product innovation process. Based on the principle decomposition symmetry, more innovative products can be invented, the inherent function and performance of the machinery can be improved.",2016,,WOS,Conference Paper

The first area, where the author sees significant changes, relates to the appearance of the new powerful players in the technological domain of the world oil and gas industry. He draws attention to the growing roles of national oil companies and multinational oilfield service firms as increasingly important investors in R&D and innovations. These developments are analyzed in the context of the overall competitive positioning of Western-based supermajors whose technological dominance in the industry has never seriously been challenged before. Another significant change, noticed by the author, relates to the new technological priorities set by the world's largest oil&gas companies for the foreseeable future. Two major sets of technologies are becoming increasingly important as strategic areas for investment by the industry giants. One of them, low-carbon technologies, reflects the dramatic evolution of the Big Oil attitude to the Energy transition. In contrast to a largely negativist (or at best `window-dressing') approach to climate agenda, visible just a decade ago, most oil&gas giants have recently adopted individual low-carbon strategies driven to a large extent by the significantly increased pressure from the powerful institutional investors and the growing influence of the negative public opinion. The second top technological priority relates to the changing digital agenda in the oil and gas industry. It reflects the transition of the industry leaders to the next generation digital technologies (including internet of things, artificial intelligence, machine learning and robotics) but most importantly to a systemic approach in digital transformation contrasting with traditional piecemeal IT projects with limited operations coverage. The changing innovation management mechanisms are also considered by the author as one of the key trends in technological domain of the world oil and gas industry. Specific focus is devoted to the formation of the corporate innovation ecosystems, including various R&D and innovation collaborations with different innovation actors (business partners, professional research centers, universities and governments organizations) and the connected vast spread of open innovation-based instruments working within these alliances.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.20542/0131-2227-2021-65-5-59-67,WOS,Journal

This new type of technology-acquiring cross-border M&A has several unique features. In particular, the cross-cultural differences between the home country and the host country and the cognitive differences between emerging markets and developed markets pose a huge challenge to the organizational learning of technology-acquiring cross-border M&A of enterprises from emerging markets. Based on this, the present study innovatively constructs an integrated theoretical model to explore the role of cross-cultural and cognitive differences in the organizational learning mechanism of technology-acquiring cross-border M&A in emerging markets. In this study, the partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM) was used in an empirical study of 240 Chinese technology-acquiring cross-border M&A enterprises, and it was found that cultural and cognitive differences play an important role in technical ability and learning performance. The study also found that the interaction of cross-cultural differences between the home and host countries and the cognitive differences between the emerging and developed markets promoted the learning performance of cross-border M&A in the emerging markets. Based on the integration theory of cultural differences, cognitive differences, and technical ability, this paper unveils the role of cross-cultural and cognitive differences in organizational learning mechanisms of technology-acquiring cross-border M&A.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.863442,WOS,Journal

A core component of the smart grid are phasor measurement units (PMUs) which offer the ability to capture time-coherent measurements across a geographically distributed area. However, due to the fast sampling rate of these devices, a significant volume of data is generated on a daily basis and this presents challenges for how to leverage the information most effectively. In this paper, we address this challenge by applying machine learning techniques to PMU data for the purpose of detecting line events in a wide-area power grid. Specifically, we use archived synchrophasor data from PMUs located across the Pacific Northwest to train and test a decision tree built using the J48 algorithm. In contrast to other studies exploring machine learning in the context of the smart grid, our work uses PMU data from a large, active, power grid as opposed to data obtained from a simulation. We show that our classifier performs as well as hand-coded rules developed by a domain expert when applied at locations near to a line fault and that it significantly outperforms hand-coded rules when identifying line faults from a distance.

The innovation adoption process however, can take 15 years before widespread adoption occurs in most healthcare systems. Current UK government policies to increase the facilitation of innovation adoption are under way. The aim of this study is to explore perceptions of tri-sectoral collaborations in the healthcare sector. The data in the study are drawn from a cross-sectional survey conducted in 2015 of professionals in academia, industry and the healthcare sectors in England, focusing on Diabetes care. Academia and healthcare respondents had the least work experience outside of their sectors compared to the industry respondents. Healthcare and academia respondents rated the industry sector less trustworthy, unethical, having different goals and less understanding of the other sectors. Industry respondents had a more positive perspective towards potential collaborators. The results from the study demonstrate greater potential challenges to tri-sectoral collaborations and the government's knowledge translation policy, due to pre-conceived notions and lack of understanding of other sectors. The purely structural approach of establishing government mandated translational networks may be insufficient without active attempts to improve collaborative relationships. Mechanisms to facilitate trust building and collaboration are proposed.

We confirm the equal importance of both cultural and institutional mechanisms as contributors to national innovativeness, and identify equifinal configurations of cultural and institutional varieties as leading to a high-tech society.

Nanotechnological materials reportedly lack cell-interactive properties and are easily degraded into unfavourable products due to the presence of synthetic polymers in their structures. This is a major drawback of nanomaterials and is a cause of concern in the biomedicine field. Meanwhile, particulate systems, such as metallic nanoparticles (NPs), have captured the interest of the medical field due to their potential to inhibit the growth of microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, and viruses). Lately, researchers have shown a great interest in hydrogels in the biomedicine field due to their ability to retain and release drugs as well as to offer a moist environment. Hence, the development and innovation of hydrogel-incorporated metallic NPs from natural sources has become one of the alternative pathways for elevating the efficiency of therapeutic systems to make them highly effective and with fewer undesirable side effects. The objective of this review article is to provide insights into the latest fabricated metallic nanocomposite hydrogels and their current applications in the biomedicine field using nanotechnology and to discuss the limitations of this technology for future exploration.

Our findings also uncovered five main design strategies: three-dimensional multimedia content, hands-on interaction with physical learning materials, gamification, spatial mappings, and location-based features. Several combinations of design and instructional strategies tended to be effective: Learning gains were enhanced by using three-dimensional multimedia with advanced organizers (presentation strategy) and/or using location-based content with learners' self-exploration (discovery strategy); and motivation was enhanced by using game mechanisms with discovery strategy. We suggest that future designers of AR early language applications should move beyond these basic approaches and consider how unique benefits of AR may be applied to support key activities in early language learning while also considering how to support sociotechnical factors such as collaboration between teachers and learners and different learning contexts.

Moreover, research on differences in innovation between men and women showed inconclusive results. Ambidexterity (Bledow, Frese, Anderson, Erez, & Farr, 2009) and Zhou and Hoever (2014) call for combining contextual and personal characteristics in innovation research suggest that pathways and variables leading to innovation between men and women could be different. Objective(s). - This study aims to analyze if men and women differ in the main antecedents for innovative behaviors. Thus, a moderating effect of gender on the relationship between innovative behaviors and their main antecedent variables is hypothesized. Results are of interest for promoting innovation and empowering women at work context. Method. - In a sample of 458 employees from 16 Spanish companies, we carried out hierarchical regression analyses on innovation behaviors, including as main antecedents academic level, proactive personality, job demands, organizational commitment, HR practices addressed to participation, and transformational leadership. In addition, interaction terms between gender and such antecedents were entered in regression analysis. Results. - Proactive personality, HR participation practices, inspirational motivation, job demands and academic level significantly predicted innovative behaviors at their different phases. Moreover, gender moderated the relationship between generation of new ideas with academic level and organizational commitment, and between promotion of ideas with job demands and idealized influence. Organizational commitment promoted generation of ideas among women but not among men, whereas idealized influence is detrimental for women. Reversely, higher job demands stimulate promotion of ideas among men but were detrimental for innovation among women. Conclusion. - Our results suggest that innovation among women seems to be more sensitive to the influence of leadership and require more social support, whereas higher job demands are detrimental. These results suggest that innovation is more related to intrinsic variables (as self-confidence, empowerment and social processes) among women, whereas for men, it seems to be more related to work demands. Results could help companies to stimulate innovation, between both men and women. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.",2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.erap.2016.04.004,WOS,Journal

Recently, innovation in artificial intelligence (AI) in the shape of self-driving cars, robots and city brains, has been pushing the so-called smart city to morph into an autonomous urban creature which is largely unknown. In this emerging strand of smart urbanism, artificially intelligent entities are taking the management of urban services as well as urban governance out of the hands of humans, operating the city in an autonomous manner. This paper explores, in theory and practice, how the development of AI intersects with the development of the city. The contribution of the paper is threefold. First, the paper advances a theoretical framework to understand AI specifically in urban contexts. It develops the concept of urban artificial intelligence, capturing the main manifestations of AI in cities. Second, the paper examines the case of Masdar City, an Emirati urban experiment, to show how the genesis of urban artificial intelligences is part of a long-standing process of technological development and a politico-economic agenda which together are enabling the transition from automation to autonomy.

First, we review the emerging hypothesis that attention is an active mechanism for information sampling and exploration in the environment. We then turn to a discussion of how reward motivates attention and how attention can be employed to reduce uncertainty about knowledge of one's current state. We further consider the way rewards interact with other factors (including novelty, surprise, and task relevance). Throughout the review, we particularly focus on the distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic motivation, highlighting curiosity as a key example of the latter in motivating the search for intrinsically desirable information that benefits learning on both long and short timescales. Finally, we discuss the role of cognitive control in directing attention during learning, as well as the way neural systems underlying cognition and motivation have implications for informing techniques for teaching and learning in wider educational contexts.

This research emphasizes strategic alignment between the innovation and the organization as the key factor shaping these decisions. In contrast, organizational research suggests that to access resources, product innovations have to be perceived as legitimate by corporate sponsors. Legitimacy is rooted in alignment with the prevalent corporate norms, beliefs, and cultural model. Adopting an institutional perspective and relying on an in-depth case study of three product innovations, this study explores legitimacy-seeking behavior in product innovation. The findings indicate that the rational perspective emphasized in most product innovation research is complemented by efforts to seek both moral and cognitive legitimacy to resource product innovation. The study clarifies the critical role that the organizational context plays in triggering legitimacy-seeking behavior. The analysis unpacks legitimacy-seeking behavior, revealing patterns of legitimating mechanisms (lobbying, relationship building, and gathering feedback) that are deployed as part of legitimacy strategies (conforming, selecting, and manipulating) to achieve a range of legitimacy outcomes (pragmatic, moral, and cognitive). The analysis reveals the existence of a hierarchy of legitimacy outcomes as actors prioritize one type of legitimacy versus another. The study also finds interdependencies between mechanisms and strategies to reinforce particular outcomes as legitimacy-seeking behavior evolves over time.

Method: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 participants of varying roles and experience (i.e., students, culinary instructors, and restaurant chefs) in the culinary and hospitality arts program at a large polytechnic in western Canada. Results: The emergent themes from these interviews indicated that the circulation of safety knowledge relied on the interaction among individuals with various levels of experience, such that those who were more experienced in the culinary arts were able to share safety knowledge with novices, who had less experience. Comparing safety knowledge gleaned from within the school against that gleaned from within the industry highlighted differences between the construction of safety in the two contexts. Notably, many aspects of safety knowledge are not learned in school and those that are may not apply in the industry context. We found that safety knowledge was shared through informal means such as storytelling, a process that allowed members to come to a deep, collective understanding of what safety meant, which they often labeled â€œcommon sense.â€ Conclusion: We found that safety knowledge was a currency through which participants achieved legitimacy, generated through continual practical accomplishment of the work in interaction with others. Practical Applications: Our findings provide novel insights into how safety knowledge is shared, and we discuss the implications of these findings for classroom, work-based learning, and other forms of curricula.

The consolidation of GVCs ruled by global lead firms and the recession of 2008-09 exacerbated the pressures on cluster actors that based their competitive advantage on local systems, spurring an increasing heterogeneity, both across and within clusters, that is still overlooked in the literature. Drawing on detailed studies of different industries and countries, Local Clusters in Global Value Chains shows the co-evolutionary trajectories of clusters and GVCs, and the role of firms and their strategies in organizing manufacturing and innovation activities in the context of ongoing technological shifts. The book explores the tension between place-based variables and global drivers of change, and the possibility for territories containing such clusters to prosper in the new global scenario. By adopting insights from the GVC framework and management studies, the book discusses how the internationalization strategies of firms create opportunities as well as constraints for adaptive upgrading in clusters. This book is of interest to both researchers and policy-makers who are interested in the dynamic sources of competitive advantage in the global economy.

Our review points to the role of the open eco-innovation research landscape as an emerging research domain of potential contributions to sustainable development. Specifically, in this systematic analysis, we apply exploratory, bibliometric, and network visualization techniques to characterize the available knowledge in the field. We trace the growth trajectory of this emerging literature and map the knowledge base of the open eco-innovation (OE) research field. We conceptualised four phases of research domain development and recognised that OE is at the acceleration phase. We emphasized that a synthetic knowledge base is one of the basic ingredients of an open eco-innovation model in addition to analytic and symbolic knowledge bases.

There are two main challenges to address the problem. First, given public application programming interfaces (APIs) for querying posts related to keywords from an extremely large vocabulary, how to infer the keywords relevant to our target interest using as few queries as possible? Second, how to deal with the agnostics of OSN's API? i.e., as different social networks typically have different running mechanisms, even with some randomness in returning results, how to build the knowledge of the API returns w.r.t. target interests from scratches? To address the above two challenges, we propose a target query discovery framework based on a deep reinforcement learning approach, named SocialSift. SocialSift intelligently interacts with OSNs' keyword-based API and develops its own knowledge in searching the optimal queries w.r.t. the target interests as well as OSN APIs. Specifically, to address the first challenge, we are inspired by the human searching experience, and recognize learning to query with context awareness to reduce the searching space, by qualifying keywords from returned results and keeping the tracks of the query trial history, or say contexts. As for addressing the second challenge, we treat OSNs' APIs as black boxes and probabilistically quantify query-interest pairs guided by rewards, which is a well-curated indicator w.r.t. target interests. Empirical results on three popular OSNs: Twitter, Reddit, and Amazon demonstrate our SocialSift significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by 12&#x0025; in retrieving target posts.

Nevertheless, these models have a mixed track record when assessed retrospectively and exhibit biases that can make them counterproductive for prescriptive policy during transition. We argue that in times of energy transitions it is preferable to develop a vision of the desired future energy system rather than relying on technoeconomic solutions based on simple objectives (e.g. lower carbon emissions). We support this argument through reasoned inference supported by historical examples. A critical appraisal of E3 modeling exercises highlights the biases, structural or implicit, favoring existing energy system modalities. As a result, if E3 models are uncritically used to formulate long-term energy policy, there is the risk of unintended or deliberate performativity preventing a radical transition. Given the significant learning-by-doing effects in reducing technology costs, the evolution of energy systems is path-dependent and reinforced by technology policy feedbacks. This is showcased by Germany's Energiewende. Therefore, it is preferable to prioritize a clear articulation of the vision for the future desired end-state which can be shared with stakeholders a priori. Then utilize models as exploratory tools for assessing the economics and scale of corresponding interventions. These should include focused technology policy that aims to commoditize relevant technical innovations through learning-by-doing and scale economies. Ideally such models should be open, exploratory, reflexive and incorporate the dynamics of innovation.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2022.102497,WOS,Journal

Although European energy intensive industries have already achieved significant energy and greenhouse gas reductions in the past, much remains to be done to make a significant contribution to achieving European as well as national climate mitigation targets of greenhouse gas emission reductions by -80 % or more (compared to the baseline of 1990). North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) is a European hotspot for coping with this challenge, accommodating more than 10 % of the energy intensive industries of the EU28. It is also the first German state to have adopted its own Climate Law, enacting state-wide CO2 emission reductions by 80 % until 2050 compared to 1990. The state government initiated the project ""Platform Climate Protection and Industry North-Rhine Westphalia"" to identify and develop the necessary far-reaching low carbon innovation strategies for energy intensive industries. Heart of the project was a dialogue process, which involved a broad spectrum of stakeholders from steel, chemical, aluminium, cement, glass and paper producing industries. Besides enhancing and broadening the knowledge on high efficiency and low-carbon technologies within industries, the aim was to explore possible pathways and preconditions for the application of these technologies in energy intensive industries as well as to strengthen the motivation of companies for initiatives and investments in technologies with lower CO2 emissions. The results of the dialogue shall provide a basis for a possible low-carbon industry roadmap NRW and may also serve as an example for other industrialized regions in the EU and globally. The paper sketches the structured dialogue process with the stakeholders from companies as well as industrial associations and presents the learnings regarding the engagement of energy intensive industries into ambitious climate policies on a regional level. These include existing limitations as well as chances in the respective sectors on the state level, regarding their economic and technical structures as well as their innovation systems. The findings are based on more than a dozen stakeholder workshops with industry companies and more than 150 individual representatives of NRW's energy intensive industries as well as on background research in the initial phase of the project.

In the past few years, the method has found a number of applications within the flexible electronics industry as printed structures for wire traces, transparent conductors and RFID and is now gaining traction within the photovoltaics industry. The IPL technology has been explored for each of the three generations of solar cells. Examples of the IPL processing technique will be detailed for each of the three generation devices: current collecting lines for the market dominant crystalline silicon technology; complimentary processing of electrochemically deposited chalcogenide thin films; and as a rational alternative for the emerging flexible perovskite materials. The most promising opportunity for the IPL within photovoltaics is the application towards the flexible large area roll-To-roll production offered by the solution phase processed perovskites.",2017,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034454745&partnerID=40&md5=bb23c29c80cd3f4e36bd842ee524637e,Scopus,Conference Paper

It forges a link between the literatures on cluster development and regional innovation systems (RISs), and explores both conceptually and empirically how cluster evolution is shaped by regional context conditions, including changes in the policy support structure and the knowledge base configuration of the RIS. We use qualitative research methods and descriptive statistics to analyse the development and transformation of the ICT cluster. Cluster emergence was enabled by strong analytical and synthetic knowledge bases in the region. The global crisis and changing geography of the ICT industry triggered a transformation of the cluster towards a new growth path with stronger symbolic components. Cluster transformation was facilitated by policy actions that promoted a diversification of knowledge bases in the region. The strategy was to combine existing competences in ICT with new competences in media and design, and to develop new activities around the theme of New Media, which integrates analytical, synthetic and symbolic knowledge. We show that the endowment of the RIS of a variety of knowledge bases and their combination has essentially supported long-term cluster development and transformation.
